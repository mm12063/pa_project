Toshiba said it would not comment on details of the bidders and their proposals.\n\nSuch a move by Tepco would mark a major development in the contest for Toshiba, which last month said it had received eight buyout proposals and two offers for capital alliances. Weakened by a series of scandals, the conglomerate has promised to consider all options, including private equity buyouts, as part of a far-reaching review process.\n\nShares of Tepco fell 7.2% to 606 yen, on track for their biggest one-day drop since September as the market appeared to worry about the impact of a potential acquisition on Tepco's finances.\n\nThe participation of local funds is seen as critical to winning government approval for a Toshiba buyout as some of the conglomerate's key businesses - including defence equipment and nuclear power - are seen as strategically important to Japan.\n\nTepco, Toshiba, utility Chubu Electric Power and Hitachi Ltd in 2019 said they agreed to consider cooperating on their nuclear plant businesses, a move seen as opening the door to closer collaboration in the Japanese industry.\n\nTepco, one Japan's 30 largest firms by revenue, is 2.7% owned by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, its third-largest shareholder, according to Refinitiv. The utility owns the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crippled by an earthquake and massive tsunami in 2011 that touched off the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.\n\nJapan's Supreme Court in March upheld an order that Tepco pay damages of around $12 million to about 3,700 people whose lives were devastated by the nuclear crisis, covering the first three of some 30 class-action suits the utility faces.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe court ruled it negligent in taking preventive measures against a tsunami of that size.\n\nJapan idled most of its nuclear plants in the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster but rising energy prices now have sparked expectations it could begin to restart them.\n\n(Reporting by Makiko Yamazaki and David Dolan; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Christopher Cushing)","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/tepco-shares-down-more-5-003301405.html","symbols":["TKECF.US","TKECY.US","TOSBF.US","TOSYY.US","TPO.F","TSE1.F"],"tags":["CONGLOMERATE","JAPAN","TOKYO ELECTRIC POWER CO","TOSHIBA CORP"],"sentiment":{"polarity":-0.773,"neg":0.064,"neu":0.891,"pos":0.045}},{"date":"2022-07-05T10:40:43+00:00","title":"Utility Giant Tokyo Electric Mulls Joining Toshiba Bid","content":"(Bloomberg) -- Japan\u2019s top utility company Tokyo Electric Power Co. is mulling joining a partnership between state-backed investment fund Japan Investment Corp. and a local private equity firm in bidding to take over Toshiba Corp., according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPerson of Interest in July 4 Parade Shooting That Killed Six in Police Custody Bezos Slams Biden Over Call for Lowering of Gas Prices Tesla Pauses Plants After Ending Shaky Quarter With a Production Milestone Biden Close to Rollback of Chinese Tariffs to Fight Inflation Ukraine Latest: Kyiv\u2019s Immediate Funding Needs Hit $65 Billion\n\nThe largest power utility in Japan, known as Tepco, is looking to secure Toshiba\u2019s nuclear business, the people said.

The drop is the most of any Nasdaq 100 or S&P 500 component, and much worse than the former index\u2019s 26% decline.\n\nThe growth outlook has weakened to the point that Netflix has cut hundreds of jobs and changed its tune on two longstanding principles: it is cracking down on password sharing, and will introduce an ad-based subscriber tier to the platform. That\u2019s on top of a backdrop where high inflation has pushed the Federal Reserve to hike rates sharply, sparking recession fuels and fueling a rotation out of tech.\n\nThe scale of the challenges suggest it will be tough for Netflix to regain a valuation that exceeded that of Walt Disney Co.\u2019s as recently as December. Now, \u201cThe Lion King\u201d parent is worth more than twice the home of \u201cTiger King.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot more competition, and the cost for Netflix to continue competing has gone up, which hurts the expectation that earnings were going to grow at aggressive rates for a long time,\u201d said Jeremiah Buckley, who oversees nearly $48 billion as a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors.\n\nEstimates for Netflix are moving in the wrong direction. The consensus for this year\u2019s revenue now stands at $32.4 billion, which although representing year-on-year growth of 9.2%, is down from the $34.1 billion that was expected at the beginning of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The consensus for adjusted earnings has declined about 16% over the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe weakening growth outlook has led Wall Street to turn sour. At the start of the year, more than 70% of analysts had Netflix as a buy. Now, just about 30% do, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Benchmark Co. among the firms downgrading their opinions this month. The consensus rating -- a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell recommendations -- is at 3.35 out of 5, the lowest since 2014.\n\nYet the stock is getting ever cheaper. Netflix now trades at around 16 times estimated earnings, near the lowest since 2008, and a fraction of a 10-year average exceeding 80. Its drop this year has been steep enough that the shares have joined the Russell 1000 Value Index following a re-balancing.\n\nDavid Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors, said investors \u201ccan at least make a case for Netflix\u201d at current levels, although he remains skeptical about its prospects, given the competitive backdrop.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re not prepared to buy Netflix yet, even though that\u2019s also considered a value name now,\u201d Katz said. \u201cIt is statistically cheap, but we have more questions than answers.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nThe Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index has fallen 31% this year, with every component down at least 14%. Some of the worst-performing stocks in the gauge include Marvell Technology Inc., Nvidia Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. While demand has remained strong for chipmakers, the industry has been plagued by constant supply constraints.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nNetflix is looking to Asia after its shock first-quarter slowdown, seeking to both maintain growth in the one region where it\u2019s still adding subscribers and replicate its success there in other parts of the world. Chinese technology stocks fell as a plan by Tencent Holdings Ltd.\u2019s major backer to further cut its stake in the company fueled concerns more investors may look to take profits following a strong rally. Toshiba Corp. shareholders elected representatives of two vocal activist hedge funds to the board in a contentious meeting, bringing the scandal-tainted industrial giant a step closer to possible privatization. Online education provider Byju\u2019s, India\u2019s most valuable startup, is pushing back payments for an approximately $1 billion acquisition struck last year, according to people familiar with the matter. GlobalWafers Co. plans to build a $5 billion semiconductor silicon-wafer facility that will be the biggest of its kind on American soil, as the country contends with the fallout from a global shortage of chips.

Toshiba external board member Mariko Watahiki earlier this month spoke out publicly against the appointments of Imai and Bhanji, saying that if they were appointed, activists would take up too much of the board. Watahiki resigned from the board after the shareholders\u2019 meeting, Toshiba said.\n\nRetail investors at the meeting questioned the appointments of both Imai and Bhanji as well as the need for privatization. Shareholders asked whether the activist funds\u2019 interests were aligned with what was good for the company over the long-term.\n\n\u201cToshiba has accumulated amazing technology precisely because it is listed,\u201d another said. \u201cPlease do not go private.\u201d\n\nExternal board member George Zage, who chairs the appointment committee that nominated Imai and Bhanji, said that the company consulted multiple law firms to review conflicts of interest, and that the appointments were designed to address lack of trust between large shareholders and management. Chief Executive Officer Taro Shimada responded to shareholders opposing privatization by saying the company would thoroughly study all options.\n\nThe board\u2019s first order of business, however, is finding a clear direction, said Chieko Matsuda, a professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University who specializes in corporate governance. Even after spinning out its memory chips, home appliances, PCs and TVs, the sprawling industrial conglomerate\u2019s remaining products still span the gamut from nuclear turbines and high-speed trains to batteries, elevators, cloud computing and semiconductors.\n\n\u201cIt is completely unclear where Toshiba is headed, what its business will be, or how it sees its future,\u201d she said.\n\n(Updates with board member resigning in the eighth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy You Should Quit Your Job After 10 Years Moving to Ban Juul, the FDA Delivers a Blow to Big Nicotine A Sci-Fi Novel\u2019s Eerily Accurate Predictions About Today\u2019s Tech Can Crypto\u2019s Richest Man Stand the Cold?

Toshiba declined comment.\n\nWatahiki, a former high court judge, had argued their appointments could make the board too skewed towards the input of activist investors.\n\nTo date only a few large Japanese companies have brought activist shareholders onto their boards. The inclusion by Toshiba is particularly significant given its history of accounting and governance crises since 2015 and tensions with its large activist investor base.\n\n\"One of the major issues that we've had as a company is a lack of trust between our large shareholders and management, and this was an attempt to address that,\" Raymond Zage, who chairs Toshiba's nomination committee, told the meeting before the vote.\n\nFarallon and Elliott together hold about 10% of Toshiba and activist shareholders are estimated to own roughly a quarter of the company.\n\nBUYOUT TALKS IN FOCUS\n\nTensions with activist investors were especially fraught last year when a shareholder-commissioned investigation concluded Toshiba had colluded with Japan's trade ministry - which sees the company's nuclear and defence technology as a strategic asset - to block overseas investors from gaining influence at its 2020 shareholder meeting.\n\nThis year, shareholders rejected management-backed plans to split the company in half, prompting Toshiba to restart a strategic review.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Since the shareholders voted down the board's strategy to split, the board has had no choice but to try to produce the outcome preferred by the large shareholders - privatisation,\" said Travis Lundy, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors who publishes on the Smartkarma platform.\n\n\"It may not be successful but they don't have the choice to do nothing.\"\n\nSeven new board directors were appointed and six including Watahiki were reappointed on Tuesday.\n\nToshiba said this month it had received eight initial buyout proposals to go private as well as two proposals for capital alliances that would see it remain listed.\n\nIt plans to shortlist bidders soon so selected suitors can start due diligence from July.\n\nJerry Black, who chairs the board's committee in charge of the strategic review, told the AGM that going private \"could possibly help\" with a radical and speedy transformation of Toshiba, while stressing that the committee has no predetermined points of view.\n\nSources have told Reuters at least one bidder is considering offering up to 7,000 yen per share to take the company private, valuing a potential deal at up to $22 billion.\n\nKKR & Co Inc, Baring Private Equity Asia, Blackstone Inc, Bain Capital, Brookfield Asset Management, MBK Partners, Apollo Global Management and CVC Capital Partners have submitted initial bids, according to sources with knowledge of the matter.\n\nSome of them may form consortia for a bid, they added.\n\nJapanese funds are also looking to see how they can participate in any deal.

Now that it has, fund managers who buy cheap, out-of-favor stocks are finally getting a chance to own shares of Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nRussia Defaults on Foreign Debt for First Time Since 1918 Hyundai Quietly Climbs the EV Sales Charts and Elon Musk Notices Rep.

Index-tracking investors now will be buying too: After FTSE Russell\u2019s annual overhaul of its equity benchmarks, Meta on Monday joined other former growth darlings Netflix Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. in the firm\u2019s value indexes, which serve as the basis for billions of dollars of passive portfolios.\n\nMeta began to attract bargain hunters after the company announced in February that Facebook\u2019s user growth had stalled, sending the shares plunging. The stock last week reached its cheapest level ever, relative to earnings. For investors who believe the problems at Facebook are temporary, that\u2019s a buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe own Meta and are very upbeat about it here,\u201d said David Katz, chief investment officer at value firm Matrix Asset Advisors. \u201cYou want to find dynamic growth companies at value prices. Meta has a good outlook, but it is being priced as though it\u2019s in a secular decline.\u201d\n\nValue funds look for stocks that are cheap relative to earnings or book value, often because of business setbacks that at least temporarily derail sales growth or profitability. Until recently Meta didn\u2019t fit the bill: The stock traded for an averaqe of 38 times estimated earnings in the first five years after its 2012 initial public offering as more people flocked to Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nStory continues\n\nShare of the company, which changed its name from Facebook to Meta in October, surged more than 780% from the IPO through the end of last year, handily beating the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. Revenue rose 23-fold in that time.\n\nHowever, with user growth stalling, the company has lost half its value this year, trading now at 12 times earnings versus a multiple of 20 for the Nasdaq 100 and 16 for the S&P 500.\n\nMeta \u201cis a deep value stock,\u201d said Alex Umansky, a global equities portfolio manager at growth investor Baron Capital.\n\nThe company is getting hit on many fronts, including a \u201cmassive brain drain,\u201d regulatory crackdowns and, most crucially, slowing user growth, because everyone who wants to be on Facebook, WhatsApp or Instagram already is, said Umansky, whose fund owned the stock from its 2012 debut until the end of last year.\n\nBrokerages estimate that the social media giant, which makes nearly all of its revenue from digital ads, will increase its revenue by 6.8% this year, the slowest pace ever, in part because of a slowing economy. They see growth picking up to around 15% in each of the next two years.\n\nTo be sure, the Facebook parent still has the best gross profit margin among megacap peers Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix and Alphabet Inc. If investors become more confident that growth will pick up again, and award the company the same valuation as the Nasdaq 100 based on estimated earnings for the next four quarters, the stock would trade at about $276, or 62% above Friday\u2019s closing price of about $170.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re with the market in being cautious in the short term but are extremely optimistic in the long run,\u201d said Global X Research analyst Tejas Dessai.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nTelecommunications companies T-Mobile US Inc., AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. have waded through multiple selloffs this year that have pounded the stock price sof technology companies big and small alike.

External director Mariko Watahiki, a former high court judge, has objected to the candidates put forward by Elliott and Farallon, saying the pair's presence on the board would skew it toward activist investors.\n\nSeveral domestic asset managers who own Toshiba shares told Reuters they agree with Watahiki's view. \"The scope of those shareholders (Elliott and Farallon) is probably much narrower than ours,\" said one, referring to the funds' interest in supporting a buyout over a longer-term strategic approach.\n\nHowever, Watahiki's objection is unlikely to amass support to reject the nominations, a person familiar with the matter said, speaking - like the asset managers - on condition of anonymity because the matter was private.\n\nThe board nominations are among signs that Toshiba, which has been exploring strategic options after shareholders voted down a restructuring plan, has become more receptive to the idea of being taken private, say hedge fund shareholders.\n\nThe shareholder representatives are expected to join the board's special committee in charge of an ongoing strategic review, Toshiba has said. If they are voted in, attention would then turn to whether director Watahiki, who serves on the committee, would retain that role.\n\nStory continues\n\nToshiba said this month it had received eight initial buyout proposals as well as two proposals for capital alliances that would see it remain listed.\n\nReuters reported that the bidders are considering offering up to 7,000 yen ($51.84) per share to take the company private, valuing the deal at up to $22 billion, although the pricing range was wide and various conditions have been attached.\n\nToshiba's shares closed at 5,707 yen on Monday, giving it a market value of $18 billion, having risen 21% since the start of the year.\n\n($1 = 135.0400 yen)\n\n(Reporting by Makiko Yamazaki; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/toshiba-shareholders-endorse-director-nominees-065004934.html","symbols":["TOSBF.US","TOSYY.US","TSE1.F"],"tags":["ACTIVIST INVESTORS","ELLIOTT MANAGEMENT","FARALLON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT","HEDGE FUND INVESTORS","INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES INC","MARIKO WATAHIKI","SHAREHOLDERS","TOSHIBA CORP"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.99,"neg":0.013,"neu":0.862,"pos":0.126}},{"date":"2022-06-23T13:42:43+00:00","title":"MicroStrategy Bulls Unfazed by Double Dose of Pain","content":"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of MicroStrategy Inc. have been hit hard this year as its once-winning approach of being a tech company that also holds billions of dollars in Bitcoin sends investors rushing for the exit. Analysts are holding fast in their bullishness.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe World\u2019s Bubbliest Housing Markets Are Flashing Warning Signs Elon Musk Says New Tesla Plants Are \u2018Money Furnaces\u2019 Losing Billions Juul Soon to Be Ordered Off the Market by FDA, WSJ Reports Powell Says Soft Landing \u2018Very Challenging;\u2019 Recession Possible Stocks Snap Rally as Recession Fears Mount: Markets Wrap\n\nThree of the four brokerages that follow the software company recommend buying the shares, with an average price target that\u2019s more than triple where the stock closed Wednesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nUnder Chief Executive Officer Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has spent about $4 billion on tokens as of March 31. While that was a hot strategy in the pandemic-fueled market boom -- when tech stocks and Bitcoin surged to record heights -- MicroStrategy is now mired in the historic selloff that\u2019s hitting both areas, slumping 69% this year. That\u2019s deeper than the Nasdaq 100 Index\u2019s 29% decline and Bitcoin\u2019s 55% drop.\n\n\u201cMicroStrategy provides equity investors in particular with not only exposure to Bitcoin, which currently they don\u2019t have many efficient ways to access,\u201d said Mark Palmer, an analyst at BTIG with a buy rating. The company also offers an operating business that generates cash with which to buy more Bitcoin, he said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t MicroStrategy\u2019s first rollercoaster ride. Its shares soared more than 3,400% during the dotcom bubble and subsequently wiped out all those gains during the collapse. The Covid-19 pandemic, which saw the rise of the retail trader, evoked memories of a similar rally thanks to Bitcoin\u2019s surge: At one point, its shares were up more than 1,200%.\n\nNow, they are on pace for their worst year since 2000, fueled by the crypto rout and bear-market plunge in tech. The Federal Reserve triggered the decline in both by aggressively raising interest rates to cool inflation, fueling concern that the economy is headed for a recession. Just last week, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency plunged below $20,000 for the first time since late 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe crypto crash generated losses for Saylor of about $3.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His 2.36 million MicroStrategy shares and options peaked in February 2021, when they were worth nearly $3 billion. They\u2019ve since plunged 86% to $355 million. Meanwhile, the Bitcoins he said in October 2020 that he owned are worth $350 million, down 71% from their $1.22 billion peak.\n\nPalmer\u2019s share-price target of $950 is the highest among analysts covering the stock, more than five times MicroStrategy\u2019s closing price of $170.91. He also estimates that Bitcoin will more than quadruple from its current level to hit $95,000 by 2023.\n\nBrent Thill of Jefferies is the only non-bull on MicroStrategy, rating the stock hold with a $180 price target. Management needs to focus on the core software business, which declined 3% in the first quarter, Thill wrote in a June 16 note.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to ignore the potential multibillion-dollar writedowns that the company could be facing. Total impairment charges on MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin holdings already reached roughly $1 billion at the end of the last quarter. The company has also come under scrutiny due to the possibility that it could face a margin call on a $205 million loan it took out this year to buy more Bitcoin.\n\nSaylor, however, told investors this month not to worry about a potential margin call, saying the company has ample collateral to pledge if necessary.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. and Saudi Aramco have been tightly contesting the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company as major forces shake up the global economy. In May, the crude producer overtook the iPhone maker, helped by the surge in oil prices while concerns around rising inflation triggered multiple routs in technology stocks. Apple shares were trading higher on Thursday, putting the stock on course for its best week in June.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nUber Technologies Inc. explored options for its Indian ride-hailing business, including a sale, but suspended discussions after tech startup valuations cratered, people familiar with the matter said. Elon Musk said Tesla Inc.\u2019s new plants in Germany and Texas are losing \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d as the electric-vehicle maker tries to ramp up production. SumUp has achieved an 8 billion euro ($8.4 billion) valuation in its latest funding round, raising 590 million euros in a deal split between debt and equity in a bid to develop new products and gain clients. Toshiba Corp. shares jumped Thursday after Reuters reported bidders are considering offering up to 7,000 yen per share to take the company private, which would value the deal at about $22 billion. JPMorgan Asset Management is doubling down on China tech stocks after enduring a tumultuous selloff, betting that an easing of regulatory crackdowns and attractive valuations will pay off well. Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said he expects people will eventually spend \u201chundreds of dollars\u201d each buying digital goods in the metaverse, including things like clothes for their virtual avatars. SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son is used to praise and encouragement from shareholders. But the company\u2019s loss of $34 billion in market value over the last year is a test for even his most faithful admirers when they gather for the annual shareholders\u2019 meeting on Friday.\n\n(Adds stock move in last paragragh.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCan Crypto\u2019s Richest Man Stand the Cold?

Apollo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDomestic funds, including Japan Investment Corp (JIC), and a number of strategic players are looking to see how they can participate in the deal, the people said, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nJIC declined to comment.\n\nWEAK YEN\n\nIf successful, the Toshiba deal would be largest buyout transaction in Japan since a consortium led by Bain took private the conglomerate's memory chip unit, Kioxia, for $18 billion in 2018.\n\nThe discussions are taking place at a time when a weak yen continues to haunt the Japanese economy, threatening to disrupt Japanese firms' business plans and turn them into attractive acquisition targets for foreign buyers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe yen plunged to a new 24-year low of 136.71 per dollar early on Wednesday.\n\nOf all the potential bidders, Bain has been \"very aggressive\" in pushing for a buyout, said two of the people.\n\nA Japanese investment banker with knowledge of the deal separately said even at 6,500 yen per share the valuation for Toshiba seemed \"too stretched\".\n\nUltimately, he said, the price would have to take into account how investors value Toshiba's 40% stake in unlisted chipmaker Kioxia.\n\nThat gave Bain an advantage over other bidders, he said, because the private equity firm owned the bulk of Kioxia, meaning it would decide the fate of the chipmaker, which in turn would impact the valuation of Toshiba.\n\nBedevilled by accounting and governance crises since 2015, Toshiba set up a special committee in April to solicit proposals after shareholders voted down a management-backed restructuring plan.\n\nThe company said earlier it would shortlist bidders for due diligence after its annual shareholders' meeting on June 28.\n\n($1 = 136.1500 yen)\n\n(Reporting by Makiko Yamazaki in Tokyo, Kane Wu and Scott Murdoch in Hong Kong; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee, Jason Neely and Tomasz Janowski)","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/exclusive-bidders-weigh-7-000-114628415.html","symbols":["TOSBF.US","TOSYY.US","TSE1.F"],"tags":["APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT","BAIN CAPITAL","BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT","CVC CAPITAL PARTNERS","JAPANESE CONGLOMERATE","TOSHIBA CORP"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.856,"neg":0.036,"neu":0.904,"pos":0.06}},{"date":"2022-06-21T20:00:00+00:00","title":"Private Equity Giants Called Vultures Eye Breakthrough in Japan","content":"(Bloomberg) -- For years, private equity giants have worked to change a damaging public perception in Japan: that they\u2019re \u201cvultures,\u201d hacking companies apart and gorging on their remains.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSwitzerland Imports Russian Gold for First Time Since War Liz Cheney Is Paying the Price in Her Home State for Crossing Trump Stocks Surge After $2 Trillion Wipeout; Bonds Fall: Markets Wrap Elon Musk Sounds Off on Recession Risk, Twitter Deal and Trump Mortgage Lenders Timed the Market Perfectly\n\nNow, Toshiba Corp. is giving the buyout industry an $18 billion opportunity to see whether those efforts have paid off.\n\nThe troubled Japanese conglomerate is soliciting acquisition offers -- and other proposals -- as it seeks to end years of mismanagement. Bain Capital, Blackstone Inc. and CVC Capital Partners are among the funds considering bids, Bloomberg News has reported. A successful deal, which may be private equity\u2019s largest ever in the country, would signal the once-criticized investors have become more accepted in Japan.\n\nBut that remains far from certain. Toshiba directors have been disagreeing publicly over the company\u2019s future, and the Japanese government, which deems the firm\u2019s nuclear power business critical to national security, would have to sign off. What\u2019s less in doubt is private equity has made progress in improving its reputation in Japan.\n\n\u201cThings are starting to change,\u201d said Kazuhiro Yamada, head of the Japan buyout advisory team at Carlyle Group Inc., the US investment house that manages $325 billion in assets. \u201cBefore, it was hard for private equity firms to even make an appointment,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, companies are increasingly approaching private equity.\u201d\n\nThe number of deals involving private equity funds hit an all-time high of 134 in Japan last year, according to the consulting firm Bain & Co. The value of transactions more than doubled from the previous year to about 2.7 trillion yen ($20 billion), close to the record from 2017. Shiseido Co. and Hitachi Ltd., both founded more than a century ago, sold parts of their business to private equity last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven the government says private equity has changed in Japan. In the first half of the 2000s, many private equity firms \u201csought to increase the value of companies over the short term through debt workouts,\u201d a representative of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry\u2019s Industrial Finance Division said in emailed comments. These days, they try to raise the value of companies over the medium to long term, mainly through overseas expansion, business diversification or acquiring other companies in the same industry, the official said.\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from the early years of the century, when one buyout, in particular, shaped the image of private equity firms in Japan. In 2000, a consortium led by Ripplewood Holdings bought the collapsed Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (now Shinsei Bank Ltd.) from the government for a price that was considered low. Ripplewood made a big profit when Shinsei listed in 2004. The deal angered the Japanese public, especially as the state cleaned up the bank\u2019s bad debts.\n\nForeign investment funds became labeled as \u201chagetaka,\u201d or vultures. A wave of overseas activist funds didn\u2019t help perceptions in the years before the global financial crisis as they pushed Japan Inc. for higher dividends and buybacks. In 2007, the public broadcaster NHK aired a popular TV drama series called \u201cHagetaka\u201d about a western investment firm taking over ailing Japanese companies and forcing them to swallow painful restructuring.\n\n\u201cEven my parents asked me if I\u2019d become a vulture,\u201d Carlyle\u2019s Yamada recalled.\n\nWhen Carlyle bought one Japanese manufacturer, its staff looked at him, wondering \u201cWho is this guy? Is he a foreigner?\u201d he said.\n\nAround that time, Japanese companies would only talk to PE firms after they\u2019d been spurned by peers in their industry, said Tetsuro Onitsuka, head of Japan private equity for Stockholm-based buyout firm EQT AB.\n\nBut in the years after the financial crisis, the situation started to change.\n\nAfter Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came to power at the end of 2012, he started to push companies to overhaul themselves, helping to sow the seeds for an increase in mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\u201cPeople began to understand that there are many different kinds of investment funds and not all of them are hagetaka,\u201d Onitsuka said.\n\nA key deal that helped change perceptions was KKR & Co.\u2019s $1.7 billion purchase of Panasonic Corp.\u2019s health-care unit, which was announced in 2013.\n\n\u201cPanasonic is a very iconic company,\u201d said Kunihiro Takahashi, head of corporate finance at Barclays Plc in Japan. \u201cThe fact that an American PE was able to buy a business from such a well-known company in Japan was very surprising.\u201d\n\nIn 2017 came an even bigger milestone, when a consortium led by Bain Capital agreed to buy Toshiba\u2019s crown-jewel memory-chip business for $18 billion. It was -- and remains -- private equity\u2019s largest deal in Japan.\n\nThe buyout sent a \u201cpositive signal\u201d that industries or assets deemed nationally important weren\u2019t \u201coff limits\u201d to foreign investors, said Jim Verbeeten, a partner at Bain & Co. in Tokyo.\n\nTo be sure, not everyone is positive about private equity. The investors have been criticized for their tactic of leveraged buyouts, saddling companies with large debts, which can give them less room to maneuver when things go wrong. The LBO was immortalized in the book \u201cBarbarians at the Gate\u201d more than three decades ago about the takeover of tobacco and food conglomerate RJR Nabisco in the US.\n\nStill, \u201cprivate equity investors provide the strategic capital which is needed for aging Japanese companies in an aging society,\u201d said Nga Pham, a research fellow at Monash Centre for Financial Studies in Melbourne. As well as injecting funds, private equity firms offer the expertise needed to help transform companies, she said.\n\nDespite its recent successes in Japan, a buyout of Toshiba would be the true litmus test of whether private equity has arrived. The company, which has a market value of about $17.8 billion, has received eight privatization offers and two alliance proposals as part of its process to solicit strategic options. A sharply weakening yen is helping make Japanese companies more attractive for foreign investors. But nothing is decided, Chief Executive Officer Taro Shimada told Bloomberg in an interview this month, saying staying public is still a possibility.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because Japan\u2019s government could nix any deal. Toshiba\u2019s nuclear business is involved in decommissioning the wrecked Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant, a critical operation for the country.\n\nThe METI division said in its emailed comments that the key for private equity funds isn\u2019t whether they\u2019re Japanese or foreign, but whether they\u2019re contributing to revitalizing the country\u2019s economy. But Koichi Hagiuda, the trade minister, was more cautious about overseas ownership of Toshiba.\n\n\u201cIf foreign investors seek a stake above certain levels, we will strictly review whether that could undermine our country\u2019s security,\u201d he told reporters at a press conference earlier this month.\n\nMonash\u2019s Pham said she doubts an international private equity firm will succeed in buying Toshiba without partnering with a domestic PE fund. State-backed investment fund Japan Investment Corp. is considering making a bid, Bloomberg reported in May.\n\nThe next step for Toshiba is to appoint a new board. One of the company\u2019s directors publicly disagreed with its inclusion of representatives from activist investors among the nominees. Shareholders will vote on the new director slate at the annual meeting scheduled for June 28.\n\nOnce the board is in place, the company will narrow down the list of investment proposals. In July or later, it give those selected the opportunity to do due diligence and ask them to submit binding bids.\n\n\u201cIf a PE succeeds in buying all of Toshiba, it will arguably be one of the most significant transactions in the country,\u201d with other similar large deals likely to follow, Takahashi of Barclays said. \u201cA global PE taking over such an iconic company will be very significant.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nEthereum Mining Is Going Away, and Miners Are Not Happy Emmanuel Macron Wants to Pay Workers a Dividend Adults Who Love Toys?

(6502.T) was on its way out of corporate governance hell and finally listening to shareholders, an outside director is pulling the company back in.\n\nMariko Watahiki, 67, a former Nagoya High Court chief, is opposing the election of two directors representing activist investors in an upcoming shareholder vote, launching a public campaign with company assistance to discredit them for lacking fairness and balance\u2014and saying they would only pursue short-term profit.\n\nMs. Watahiki, who became an external board member last year and owns no Toshiba stock according to the company\u2019s website, has spoken out against Eijiro Imai, a managing director at Farallon Capital Management, and Nabeel Bhanji of Elliott Management Corp. both in press interviews and a Toshiba-organized press conference. The ploy is bizarre because it comes after Toshiba itself announced a slate of 13 proposed directors last month including Messrs. Imai and Bhanji ahead of its shareholder meeting scheduled for June 28. The two activist funds collectively hold about $2 billion of Toshiba stock.\n\nUntil Ms. Watahiki\u2019s attempt to subvert Toshiba\u2019s own agreement with Farallon and Elliott emerged, it appeared the company was finally on a path to creating real shareholder value after years of scandal and flagrantly-poor share price performance. Toshiba has said it received\u00a0eight offers\u00a0to buy out the conglomerate, as well as two proposals for capital and business alliances. The company said in a filing it will evaluate the non-binding bids and choose one or more to pursue after the shareholder meeting.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company hasn\u2019t disclosed names, but the suitors are as serious as they come. Mainstream media reports indicate private equity investors including\u00a0CVC Capital Partners,\u00a0Blackstone Inc., KKR\u00a0and\u00a0Bain Capital\u00a0were\u00a0considering\u00a0making bids, as well as state-backed investment fund\u00a0Japan Investment Corp. Private equity fund\u00a0MBK Partners\u00a0also submitted a bid and may form a consortium for Toshiba.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable why senior management at Toshiba might be backing Ms. Watahiki behind the scenes. In Japanese conglomerates, employment is usually for life and many executives still cling to the security and prestige of a big corporate name. Cross-shareholdings with insurers and other large corporations also add to their clout.\n\nBut Ms. Watahiki\u2019s argument that activist investors don\u2019t know enough about Toshiba\u2019s business is curious coming from someone who was a judge for 40 years with little corporate management experience. Of note, she\u2019s also on the governance committee at LIXIL Group Corp., which manufactures housing equipment. This only makes her use of corporate money to oppose the directors more concerning.\n\nNeither Toshiba, Farallon nor Elliott responded to requests for comment from CorpGov. Despite organizing a press conference with Ms. Watahiki, the company said this week that Ms. Watahiki\u2019s opinions are her personal views and don\u2019t represent the company\u2019s position. Ms. Watahiki, who couldn\u2019t be reached for comment, recently told Bloomberg, \u201cIf we take people from just one specific group, it\u2019s impossible to avoid conflicts of interest.\u201d\n\nCorpGov has extensively reported on Toshiba\u2019s previous struggles with governance and securities lawyers say several elements about the current situation raise fresh concerns. First, the company inserted a footnote in the so-called convocation notice announcing the annual meeting to indicate that Ms. Watahiki opposed the nomination of Messrs. Imai and Bhanji even though the company had reached a deal to place them on the board including standard nomination agreements.\n\n\u201cIt is very unusual to see objections of a vocal minority of a board to the candidates recommended by the majority of the directors, particularly after a company has entered into a nomination agreement supporting the election of these candidates,\u201d said Lawrence Elbaum, Partner at Vinson & Elkins LLP in New York and co-head of his firm\u2019s Shareholder Activism practice.\n\nMs. Mariko Watahiki\n\nHe said that the nomination agreements for Farallon and Elliot looked to be well within the market for shareholders who strike friendly deals for board seats. \u201cI have read hundreds of nomination agreements, and the Toshiba agreements include many of the typical terms a company and nominating shareholders would expect to see surrounding the board\u2019s efforts to elect shareholder-approved directors and the concessions from activist shareholders in return.\u201d\n\nIt is also concerning that Ms. Watahiki\u2019s press conference was hosted by Toshiba itself. \u201cUsually, when less than a majority of a board disagrees with the directors endorsed by the majority, should the minority wish to voice their dissent, they will do it on their own dime through their own PR channels,\u201d Mr. Elbaum said. \u201cIf a company reaches a deal to support certain directors, and is required to use best efforts to get them elected, then any activist may claim with force that best efforts are not met where company permits a dissenting director to air dirty laundry about directors subject to a nomination agreement.\u00a0 The activist may argue the company needs to go much further to provide that best efforts are being used to get the new director nominees elected.\u201d\n\nToshiba\u2019s leaders have long fought against the idea of privatization, with former Chief Executive Officer Satoshi Tsunakawa laying out five reasons why it would be the wrong decision earlier this year. Taro Shimada, the new chief executive, recently told The Wall Street Journal that he wanted any buyer to keep the company in one piece to promote innovation. Mr. Shimada pointed out that Toshiba\u2019s business model has worked in the past, yielding such fruits as the first laptop computer in the 1980s.\n\nLike early laptops, business models that thrived in the 80s have evolved with the times. If Ms. Watahiki and the old guard she represents continue to resist change, stakeholders in Toshiba and Japan Inc. will risk being left behind.\n\nContact:\n\nCorpGov\n\nwww.CorpGov.com\n\nJarrett Banks\n\nEditor-at-Large\n\njb@capmarketsmedia.com","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/toshiba-fails-governance-litmus-test-205558289.html","symbols":["BBN1.F","BX.US","KKR-PC.US","KKR.US","KR51.F","TOSBF.US","TOSYY.US","TSE1.F"],"tags":["BEST EFFORTS","FARALLON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT","MARIKO WATAHIKI","PRESS CONFERENCE","PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS","TOSHIBA"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.995,"neg":0.041,"neu":0.864,"pos":0.095}},{"date":"2022-06-07T12:01:30+00:00","title":"Toshiba director defends board nominees from hedge fund shareholders","content":"By Makiko Yamazaki and Yuki Nitta\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) - A Toshiba Corp external director on Tuesday rejected criticism that having two shareholder representatives would skew the board, as boardroom tensions at the troubled conglomerate erupted into a public row over a slate of director candidates.\n\n\"I disagree that the board is skewed,\" Jerry Black, an external director on Toshiba's five-member nomination committee, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.\n\nBlack's comment was in reference to objection by another nomination committee member, Mariko Watahiki, to two board director candidates from hedge fund shareholders Elliott Management and Farallon Capital Management.\n\nWatahiki, a former high court judge, has said the slate lacks diversity, fairness and balance on the board.\n\n\"When it comes to the two directors, I think that they are going to be great contributors to the board,\" Black said.\n\n\"They were evaluated based upon the individual capabilities.

A few months on, the market has taken care of the problem.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAmazon\u2019s Stock Split Delivers More Than Bargained For Elon Musk Says Twitter\u2019s Lack of Info on Bots Breaches Merger Deal Stocks Rise as Higher Yields Keep Check on Rally: Markets Wrap Why Peak Inflation Is Near, According to Experts Who Bet on Short-Lived Price Rises Fed Delivers Fuzzier Rate Message as It Gauges Impact of Hikes\n\nAmazon, whose 20-for-1 split took effect Monday, is among companies whose stocks have tumbled since the moves were announced amid a broad market selloff that\u2019s been especially painful for the technology sector. Shares of the e-commerce giant rose 2% in New York after the split, but shares are still down about 10% since reporting the plan in March. Alphabet, which announced a similar proposal in February, is down 17% since then.\n\nThe selloff means the stocks will be trading at a discount to the sticker price originally envisioned by executives. That will make it easier for the behemoths to gain entry to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, whose weighting is based on share price, but it could have the effect of making them look less princely than their massive market values and history of big gains would imply.\n\n\u201cStock splits are usually a sign of optimism,\u201d said Mark Lehmann, chief executive officer of JMP Group. \u201cVery few companies split their stock in anticipation of things going poorly. It\u2019s an example of what\u2019s reflected in the entire market.\u201d\n\nSplits, of course, have no fundamental effect on share value -- they\u2019re the stock market equivalent of exchanging a $20 bill for two $10s. But in the buoyant market of early 2022, they were met with bidding wars by giddy traders.\n\nFor companies like Shopify Inc. that have fared even worse than Amazon and Alphabet amid an exodus from stocks with the highest valuations, the splits could make them look downright pedestrian. If the 10-for-1 exchange plann by the Canadian e-commerce company was done today, it would result in a US share price of about $35 following a 79% crash from a November high when the stock closed at a record $1,690.60. The median stock price in the S&P 500 Index, by contrast, is around $113, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shopify\u2019s split is set to take effect on June 29.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, the sour market sentiment could cause companies like Tesla Inc. to rethink their plans. The electric-car maker said in late March it would ask investors this year to approve the creation of additional shares for the purposes of another split. The stock was trading above $1,000 at the time. Since then, the shares have lost nearly a third of their value, closing Friday at $703.55, amid manufacturing problems in China and concerns about slowing growth.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nDidi Global Inc. shares surged 65% on Monday after the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese regulators are preparing to wrap up their investigation into the ride-hailing giant. Shares were trading at around $3, still about 81% below its $16.40 peak close in July last year. Through Friday\u2019s close, Didi shares had sunk nearly 90% from their peak, wiping off more than $70 billion in market value, after its blockbuster US listing drew the wrath of Beijing and made it the face of the nation\u2019s tech crackdown.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nChinese regulators are preparing to wrap up their investigation into Didi Global Inc. and restore the ride-hailing giant\u2019s main apps to mobile stores as soon as this week, the Wall Street Journal reported.

They are also expected to be built in factories as opposed to today's massive light-water reactors that are built on site and typically run billions of dollars over budget.\n\nSMR backers say they are a safe way to boost generation of virtually emissions-free electricity and will help curb climate change.\n\nBut the reactors would create more radioactive waste, per unit of electricity they generate, than conventional reactors by a factor of up to 30 according to a study https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/doi\/full\/10.1073\/pnas.2111833119 published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nSome of the reactors, with molten salt and sodium-cooled designs, are expected to create waste that needs to go through additional conditioning to make it safe to store in a repository. Those treatments are vulnerable to being converted by militants to make fissile materials for a crude nuclear bomb, it said.\n\nAllison Macfarlane, a co-author of the study and former head of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said SMR designers \"don't pay that much attention in general to the waste ... because the thing that makes money for them is the reactor.\"\n\n\"But it's important to know about the waste products and whether they're going to pose any difficulties in disposing of them and in managing them,\" Macfarlane said.\n\nThe United States has no plan to permanently store long lasting, toxic nuclear waste, after Washington stopped funding the Yucca Mountain waste site in Nevada. Instead, the waste, which the industry calls spent nuclear fuel, mostly sits at nuclear plants in pools and later in dry casks made of steel and concrete.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Even if we had a robust waste management program, we think there would be a lot of challenges to deal with some of the SMR waste,\" said Lindsay Krall, the study's lead author.\n\nNuScale Power Corp reactors, which could use light water as a coolant, as do conventional nuclear plants, would produce about 1.7 times more waste per energy equivalent than traditional reactors, the study found.\n\nDiane Hughes, a NuScale spokesperson, said the study used outdated design information and incorrect assumptions about the plants.\n\nOther reactors, being planned by Terrestrial Energy and Toshiba Corp that plan to use fuels and coolants different than traditional reactors are also expected to create more waste per unit of energy, the study said. Those reactors would likely require additional procedures known as conditioning which offer pathways to proliferation, it said.\n\nSimon Irish, Terrestrial Energy's chief executive, said its plant would generate less waste per unit of power and the company is developing a conversion process to make waste more geologically stable than waste from current reactors.\n\nToshiba did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Timothy Gardner; editing by Richard Pullin)","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/small-nuclear-power-projects-may-214445331.html","symbols":["TOSBF.US","TOSYY.US","TSE1.F"],"tags":["CONVENTIONAL PLANTS","FISSILE MATERIALS","NUCLEAR BOMB","NUCLEAR PLANTS","NUCLEAR REACTORS","RADIOACTIVE WASTE","SMALL MODULAR REACTORS","SMR","WASTE PRODUCTS"],"sentiment":{"polarity":-0.973,"neg":0.112,"neu":0.812,"pos":0.076}},{"date":"2022-05-27T10:53:01+00:00","title":"Exclusive-Japanese buyout firms JIP, Polaris considering bids for Toshiba - sources","content":"By Makiko Yamazaki and Scott Murdoch\n\nTOKYO\/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Japanese buyout firms Japan Industrial Partners (JIP) and Polaris Capital Group are each considering participating in bids for Toshiba Corp, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday.\n\nToshiba, which has been bedevilled by accounting and governance crises since 2015, set up a special committee last month to explore strategic options, including potential deals to go private, after shareholders voted down a management-backed restructuring plan.\n\nBoth funds, far smaller than some global private equity firms, would need to team up with others, the sources said.
