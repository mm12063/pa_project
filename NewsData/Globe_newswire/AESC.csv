"2022-07-19T12:19:12+00:00","FirstEnergy (FE) to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?","FirstEnergy Corporation FE is slated to release second-quarter 2022 results on Jul 27 after market close. The firm delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3.2% in the last reported quarter.\r\n\r\nLet’s see how things have shaped up before the upcoming earnings announcement.\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nFirstEnergy’s second-quarter earnings are likely to have benefited from ongoing cost management initiatives, which, in turn, are expected to have reduced operating and maintenance expenses. The higher demand from the residential, commercial and industrial groups is expected to have boosted second-quarter earnings.\r\n\r\nAlso, FE’s second-quarter earnings are likely to have benefited from the company’s ongoing transformational activities and customer-focused initiatives.\n\nExpectations\n\nFirstEnergy expects second-quarter earnings in the range of 46-56 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 52 cents per share, which indicates a decline of 11.9% from the year-ago reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter sales stands at $2.78 billion, suggesting growth of 6% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nWhat Our Quantitative Model Predicts\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for FE this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is not the case here as you will see below.\n\nFirstEnergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise FirstEnergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nFirstEnergy Corporation price-eps-surprise | FirstEnergy Corporation Quote\n\nEarnings ESP: FirstEnergy has an Earnings ESP of +0.96%.

NextEra Energy has an Earnings ESP of +2.70% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. NEE’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth is projected at 9.3%.\r\n\r\nAmerican Electric Power AEP is likely to come up with an earnings beat when it reports second-quarter results on Jul 27 before market open. American Electric Power has an Earnings ESP of +6.77% and carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present. AEP’s long-term earnings growth is projected at 6.2%.\r\n\r\nAES Corporation AES is likely to come up with an earnings beat when it reports second-quarter results on Aug 5 before market open.

Efficient management of debt is also expected to boost second-quarter earnings.\n\nExpectations\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings and revenues is pegged at 74 cents per share and $5.7 billion, respectively. Earnings per share and revenue estimates indicate year-over-year growth of 4.23% and 44.47%, respectively.\n\nWhat Our Quantitative Model Predicts\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NextEra Energy this time around.

If you want to skip reading about Dan Loeb's view on the current market situation and his hedge fund's performance, you can go directly to 5 Stocks You Should Sell in 2022 According to Billionaire Dan Loeb.\n\nDan Loeb founded his hedge fund, Third Point, back in 1995 with a borrowed $3.3 million from his friends and family. He rose to prominence after his activist shareholder strategies paid off and he successfully executed numerous corporate takeovers over the years of his career. As of June 2022, the activist investor is worth $4.2 billion according to data from Forbes. As of March 31, 2022, Dan Loeb manages over $7.68 billion in 13F securities through his hedge fund.\n\nDan Loeb is also fond of collecting art and is well-known for his art collection. In a 2011 article, Business Insider ranked Dan Loeb among its ""Wall Street's 25 Most Serious Art Collectors"" list and noted that the billionaire is just as quick to take profits from art as he is from stocks. On May 6 the billionaire, in his first quarter 2022 letter to investors, drew an analogy between the current market situation and a 1982 documentary “Koyaanisqatsi”. Koyaanisqatsi means ""life out of balance"", much like the current stock market situation is according to billionaire Dan Loeb. Mr. Loeb further elaborated on why, according to him, investors face challenges in tightening economic environments and said that he believes investors stick to their school of thought and do not change their ways to suit better to current market trends. The billionaire wrote:\n\nI have said before that they don’t ring a bell when the rules of the game are changing, but if you listen closely, you can hear a dog whistle.\n\nThird Point's Returns and Most Recent Portfolio\n\nLooking at Third Point's quarter-on-quarter performance, the New York-based hedge fund returned 26.04% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to Q4 2019. In the first quarter of 2021, Third Point reported a quarter-on-quarter return of 3.99%. As of the first quarter of 2022, Third Point's returns have sunk to a negative 22.62% from Q4 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Dan Loeb's most recent investor letter, Third Point's offshore fund dipped to a negative 11.5% in the first quarter of 2022, as measured from the beginning of the year. However, the fund's median annualized returns still sit at 14.3% since inception, outperforming the S&P 500's comparable returns of 9.3% and the MSCI World Index's median annual returns of 7.7% over the same period.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, Third Point completely discarded 26 of its positions, reduced stakes in 22 companies, added 9 new stocks to its portfolio and raised its stakes in 5 of its previous holdings. Some of Dan Loeb's top disposals were Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). 10 Stocks You Should Sell in 2022 According to Billionaire Dan Loeb\n\nDan Loeb of Third Point\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo determine the 10 stocks you should sell in 2022 according to billionaire Dan Loeb, we reviewed Third Point's first-quarter 2022 investment portfolio and picked companies the billionaire completely exited.

Align remains among the fastest growing and most innovative companies in consumer health.”\n\n8.

The company reported earnings that were disappointing relative to the growth trajectory of both pre-COVID and prior quarters over the past fiscal year. We are concerned that the company is seeing slowing traction in the enterprise sector and felt that the weak topline and billings guidance along with margin compression from increased sales and marketing costs creates too many headwinds for us to be comfortable with. The weak fiscal year 2023 billings guidance when combined with management’s qualitative comments about a strong pipeline is concerning to us, and we believe management has done a disappointing job in providing more transparency around the growth drivers for the business.”\n\n7.

That could hinder deployment of some clean-energy projects.\n\n“The new technologies that are more complicated and harder to develop are going to have a harder time getting access to tax equity financing,” Mackler said in an interview. “Ironically, the technologies that Senator Manchin and others are most supportive of would be the most hurt if direct pay were taken off the table.”\n\nThe reconciliation package that passed the House in November would let developers use direct pay to claim hundreds of billions of dollars of tax credits for technologies ranging from wind and solar to nuclear power, hydrogen and carbon capture. Proponents argue that the option is more effective because it lets funding flow directly to projects and developers.\n\nTax-equity deals require developers to arrange financing through intermediaries, which typically take a fee. The size of the deals may also be smaller than credits available through direct pay.\n\nA spokeswoman for Manchin, a moderate who plays a key role in the evenly split Senate, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Manchin Says EV Tax Credit Bonus Is Gone From Spending Bill\n\nThe issue is among the remaining sticking points as Democrats seek to hammer out an agreement on their massive spending package before the midterm campaign season kicks into high gear. Other remaining areas of negotiation include details on a tax credit for electric vehicles including the value and eligibility requirements, one of the people said.\n\nManchin has previously voted for a non-binding Republican amendment that proposed prohibiting people making more than $100,000 a year from claiming EV tax credits and to end tax credits for vehicles that cost more than $40,000. Backers of the credit say those restrictions would exclude many of the vehicles available now or expected to come to market in the next few years, including some promoted by President Joe Biden.\n\nManchin is also seeking to make the package more friendly to fossil fuels, efforts sure to draw the ire of progressive lawmakers and environmental groups. That includes a proposed tax credit for carbon capture that’s seen as extending the life of coal plants, and increasing drilling in the western Gulf of Mexico, one of the people said. Manchin also wants to increase the duration of a tax credit for so-called blue hydrogen made from natural gas, another person familiar said.\n\nRead more: Biden’s Carbon-Capture Plan Hands Lifeline to Coal Plants\n\nBackers of the direct pay option have mounted a last-ditch lobbying effort to ensure it stays in the package.\n\n“There is an enormous amount of work going on to get him in a place where he understands how urgently needed direct pay is,” Erin Duncan, the Solar Energy Industries Association’s vice president of congressional affairs said this month. The Washington-based trade group represents companies like renewable project developer AES Corp. and power generator Vistra Corp.\n\nThe efforts come as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Manchin have been meeting weekly to hammer out a framework for a deal. Manchin has said he can accept a partisan package that raises taxes on the wealthy and corporations, reduces the deficit, lowers drug prices and addresses energy.\n\nRead more: Biden Team Negotiates Fresh Economic Plan as Inflation Antidote\n\nThe two lawmakers have examined details of the House tax, drug price and energy provisions to determine what exactly Manchin can support. The goal is to draft a bill that would get 50 votes and pass it by the August recess. They face a September 30 deadline when budget reconciliation powers derived from the fiscal 2022 budget expire.\n\nEven if Manchin and Schumer strike a deal it’s unclear whether House progressives would support it. The $2.2 trillion House package that Manchin blocked in December had dozens of top priorities for them, including paid parental leave, childcare subsidies and a refundable and expanded child tax credit. Progressives may balk at a slimmed down approach.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLVMH Has a Younger Arnault Working on Its Makeover of Tiffany’s Ethereum Mining Is Going Away, and Miners Are Not Happy Emmanuel Macron Wants to Pay Workers a Dividend The NBA Turns to Africa to Fuel Basketball’s Next Era of Growth China’s Consumer Confidence Crisis Will Leave Permanent Scars\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/manchin-opposing-energy-payments-seen-161819327.html","0V6.F","AES.F","AES.US","AESC.US","VST.US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BLOOMBERG","CARBON CAPTURE","DIRECT PAY","DIRECT PAYMENTS","SASHA MACKLER","SENATOR JOE MANCHIN","SENATOR MANCHIN","TAX CREDITS","","","","","0.994","0.056","0.834","0.11"

Shaw Renewable Investments.\n\nGoal of the Consortium\n\nU.S. President Biden recently invoked the Defense Production Act to aid the domestic production of clean energy technologies, including solar panel parts, and reduce the dependence of the nation on the imports of solar components and parts.\n\nIn this context, the recent consortium aligns with the government’s initiative and highlights the procurement of more than $6 billion of solar panels. Also, the group seeks to add manufacturers who can supply up to 7 gigawatts (GW) of solar modules per year from the beginning of 2024.\n\nSuch initiatives are likely to boost investments in the U.S. solar market and provide immense opportunities for the solar components manufacturing companies of the region to capitalize on the growing demand and bolster their growth trajectory.\n\nAES Corp’s Contribution to the Goal\n\nAES Corp. is currently leading the utility industry's transition to clean energy by investing in sustainable growth and innovative solutions. The company has a strong pipeline of solar projects, which boast a strong demand for various solar components that will be needed to develop the projects.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that AES Corp. has 3.4 GW of new projects coming online from 2022 to 2025 out of a total backlog of 10.3 GW across all geographies and technologies. Moreover, in 2021, AES signed contracts for 5 GW of power purchase agreements for renewable energy, including 1.4 GW for U.S. solar projects.\n\nWith such a strong backlog of solar projects, the company is well-poised to fulfill its commitment to contributing to restoring the growth of the U.S. solar manufacturing sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks to Benefit\n\nWith the entire Utility sector rapidly transitioning to a green environment, utility providers that are adopting solar power as their preferred energy resource and thus expected to gain as the aforementioned consortium sees daylight include:\n\nDuke Energy’s DUK subsidiary, Duke Energy Renewables, owns and operates approximately 500 megawatts (MW) of photovoltaic solar power projects at more than 50 solar plants across the country, delivering customized solar solutions to utilities, municipalities, electric cooperatives and large business customers. The company plans to add about 4,525 MW of solar power during the next 20 years.\n\nDuke Energy’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 6.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DUK’s 2022 sales suggests a growth rate of 6.6% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nEversource EnergyES currently has 70 MW of solar power facilities operating in Massachusetts and its five-year forecast includes expenditures of $500 million to build an additional 280 MW of solar generation capacity.\n\nEversource Energy boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ES’ 2022 sales indicates a growth rate of 10% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nWEC Energy WEC is investing heavily in the cost-effective zero-carbon generation like solar and wind. It has plans to build 2,400 MW of solar, wind and battery storage in the 2022-2026 period to further strengthen its renewable portfolio.\n\nWEC Energy’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 6.1%.

The consolidated value of these stakes is roughly $1.5 billion. Orbis Investment Management held the largest position in the company, with stakes worth over $437.3 million.\n\nJust like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is also down for 2022 amid market volatility.\n\n9. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK)\n\nDividend Yield as of June 20: 3.31%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 54\n\nLevin Capital Strategies’ Stake Value: $23,742,000\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) is an American custodian bank and securities services company, which provides financial and banking services to its consumers. In Q1 2022, the company’s assets under management reached over $2.3 trillion, showing a 2% growth from the same period last year.\n\nLevin Capital opened its position in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) during the fourth quarter of 2010, with shares worth over $13.8 million. At the end of Q1 2022, the hedge fund owned 478,376 BK shares, valued at over $23.7 million. The company represented 2.28% of John A.

In April, JPMorgan mentioned the bank’s sensitivity to higher interest rates and lowered its price target on The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) to $51.50, with a Neutral rating on the shares.\n\nAt the end of Q1 2022, 54 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), up from 49 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $4.5 billion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway held the largest stake in the company in Q1, worth $3.6 billion.\n\nAriel Investments mentioned The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“Rising interest rates, after a surprisingly long period of low absolute rates and negative “real” rates, will create a headwind. While there has been much debate about the cause of these low rates, we believe the most important factor has been the $120 billion in monthly federal reserve open market bond purchases and the accumulation of an $8 trillion balance sheet. The former will end, and the latter will shrink. It is not just the Fed that has aggressively purchased bonds, bidding up prices and lowering yields. Bond traders and hedge fund managers have added to positions, confident that being on the same side as the Fed was the wise place to be. Now as the Fed is about to become a seller of bonds rather than a buyer, Wall Street’s “smart money” is likely to follow suit. Against this backdrop, fixed income securities and bond substitutes such as high dividend paying utilities and absolute return hedge funds are substantially overpriced and are not likely to produce attractive returns going forward.\n\nThis expectation of a reversion to the mean for interest rates helped 2021 performance, though not as much as we had hoped. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury did indeed increase from +0.92% at the beginning of the year to +1.52% at year-end. An underreported story was the poor performance of bonds last year. The Barclays Aggregate Index declined -1.67% for the year ending December compared to a return of +28.71% for equities as measured by the S&P 500. Interest rates have continued to climb in 2022 with the 10-year Treasury at +1.79% as we go to print. This move higher in rates has contributed to our good, early start to 2022. Smaller positions in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) also benefited from higher rates, principally with their ability to invest customer cash.”\n\n8. AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE:AVB)\n\nDividend Yield as of June 20: 3.33%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 29\n\nLevin Capital Strategies’ Stake Value: $702,000\n\nAvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE:AVB) is a Virginia-based real estate investment trust that invests in apartments. In May, the company posted a 96.5% growth in residential economic occupancy, from 96.4% in April.

(NYSE:AVB) and owned 2,826 shares worth $702,000. The company represented 0.06% of John A. Levin’s portfolio.

Cliff Asness, Ken Griffin, and Ric Dillon were some of the company’s major stakeholders in Q1 2022.\n\nClearBridge Investments mentioned Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“While the level of general turnover abated as we progressed through 2021, it remained high in one area: post-COVID-19 recovery plays. The concept behind this investment thesis was, and still is, straightforward: with the advent of effective vaccines, the path from pandemic to endemic is just a matter of time. As this transition occurs, the estimated excess savings of over $2 trillion built up on U.S. consumer balance sheets will unlock dramatic pent-up demand for experiences, especially global travel. This investment case seemed especially compelling when the Pfizer vaccine positively surprised markets in November 2020. As a result, we made post-COVID-19 stocks (which were trading well below our estimate of recovery value) a sizable theme within the portfolio. We understood this to be a more aggressive tilt in positioning because it required a major improvement in demand to catalyze fundamentals and drive price toward higher business values. While we accepted that recovery would not be smooth and that it would take time to deploy vaccines both domestically and globally, we decided that recovery was the logical path of least resistance and we were being well compensated for these risks.\n\nWhat we did not account for, however, was vaccine hesitancy and the risk of further infection waves. As a result, the first variant wave, Delta, was a negative surprise to both the market and our team. When the risk surfaced, we immediately updated our probability-driven models and debated how we should react. The resulting conclusion was that the recovery would be delayed and that we should reduce our exposure quickly, subsequently targeting the most aggressive recovery stocks such as cruise lines. We again acted swiftly and decisively to the positive surprise that Pfizer had delivered a high-efficacy antiviral COVID-19 pill. This pill should greatly reduce COVID-19 severity risks globally, increasing the probability of a global travel recovery in 2022. While this is still true, the emergence of the highly mutated Omicron variant set off another infection wave which spurred us to again act quickly and further reduce our risk exposure. This back-and-forth may sound exhausting, but it highlights our compulsion to act if we determine a surprise has a large enough impact on the probabilities that power our valuation-driven investment cases.\n\n6.

"2022-06-10T12:32:40+00:00","Is There An Opportunity With The AES Corporation's (NYSE:AES) 34% Undervaluation?","Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for AES\n\nWhat's the estimated valuation?\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$872.0m US$742.9m US$830.2m US$1.08b US$1.06b US$1.05b US$1.05b US$1.05b US$1.06b US$1.08b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x4 Analyst x6 Analyst x6 Analyst x4 Analyst x1 Est @ -0.91% Est @ -0.06% Est @ 0.54% Est @ 0.95% Est @ 1.24% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1%  US$822 US$661 US$696 US$856 US$789 US$737 US$694 US$658 US$627 US$598\n\n(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.1b\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2031 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.1b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.1%– 1.9%) = US$27b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$27b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$15b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$22b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$21.6, the company appears quite undervalued at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nThe assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at AES as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.975. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nMoving On:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

They will keep paying their dividends and their stock prices will tend to do better than average as a result. NRG Energy (NRG): Texas power utility with 20% forecast earnings trading for 9.6 times forward earnings and a 3% dividend yield. Edison International (EIX): This electric utility company has a 4.3% dividend yield and a forward P/E of 14 times with good earnings growth. Pinnacle West Corporation (PNW): This Southwest U.S. utility has a 4.5% dividend yield, higher than its 4-year average of 3.79%, which implies its reversion to the mean target market value is higher. FirstEnergy Corp (FE): This Akron, Ohio-based utility, which covers 5 mid-Atlantic states from Ohio to New York, pays a 3.7% dividend yield, and has an attractive forward P/E multiple of just 15.8. The AES Corporation (AES): This US and overseas utility has good earnings growth, an 11 times forward P/E multiple, and a stable 3.1% dividend yield which has been raised in each of the past 9 years. UGI Corporation (UGI): This propane company is trading for 12.2 times forward earnings with good earnings growth along with a 3.5% dividend yield.\n\nUtility stocks offer investors a good comfort for several reasons. For one, the utility often has a monopoly to deliver energy to its customers. This makes its revenue and cash flow secure enough to maintain growing dividends. Second, they tend to have reasonable valuations.\n\nOur list of utility stocks has low price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples ranging from 9 to 16 times earnings. They also have good dividend yields that range from 3 to 5%.\n\nThe 7 Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for Income\n\nLet’s dive in and look at these utility stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNRG NRG Energy $46.89 EIX Edison International $68.05 PNW Pinnacle West Corporation $77.95 FE FirstEnergy Corp $43.35 AES The AES Corporation $21.31 UGI UGI Corporation $41.76\n\nNRG Energy (NRG)\n\nStory continues Close up of NRG logo on website against blurred background.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nNRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) is a Houston-based integrated power company that trades for just 11.6 times forward earnings (for 2023) and also has a 3% yield and growing dividends. It is one of the largest U.S. independent power producers. It has 6 million customers and generates 18 gigawatts of power generation capacity primarily in Texas.\n\nNRG stock is attractive to bargain-focused investors due to its dividend yield with nine years of continuously paid dividends.\n\nAnalysts forecast $3.96 in earnings per share (EPS) this year and $4.76 next year. So, trading at $45.98 at the start of May 25, NRG stock trades for 9.7 times 2023 earnings estimates.\n\nMoreover, the company has plenty of FCF to cover both its dividends and buyback programs. Last year it generated $493 million in cash flow from operations and paid out just $319 million in dividends plus $48 million in buybacks.\n\nThis makes NRG stock one of the best utility stocks.\n\nEdison International (EIX) Southern California Edison sign and logo EIX stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nEdison International (NYSE:EIX) is an electrical power generator in Southern, Central and Coastal California with over 15 million customers.

Moreover, given its $2.80 annual dividend, EIX stock has a dividend yield of 4.3%.\n\nEIX has paid a dividend for the past 18 years on a quarterly basis. In fact, it has raised the annual dividend every year for the past 18 years. That should give investors comfort that this will occur in the future, recession or not. This fact will allow EIX to hold up well during a possible economic downturn.\n\n7 Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nThe fact is that everyone needs to buy electricity and pay their electric bills even during a recession.

Morningstar says that its average has been 17.7 times.\n\nIn addition, PNW has a $3.40 dividend which puts PNW stock on an ample dividend yield of 4.5%. In fact, PNW has paid dividends annually for the past 28 years and in the last 10 years, the dividend has risen each year.\n\nGiven these factors and the company’s underlying stable growth, this looks like one of the best utility stocks to own in case there is a recession.\n\nFirstEnergy Corp (FE) neon pink and blue graphic of a lightning bolt\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/wacomka\n\nFirstEnergy Corp (NYSE:FE) is an Akron, Ohio electric utility that operates in six Mid-Atlantic states from Ohio to New York with 6 million customers.

"2022-05-23T11:34:13+00:00","Return Trends At AES (NYSE:AES) Aren't Appealing","To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Although, when we looked at AES (NYSE:AES), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for AES:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.084 = US$2.4b ÷ (US$35b - US$5.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nTherefore, AES has an ROCE of 8.4%. In absolute terms, that's a low return, but it's much better than the Renewable Energy industry average of 3.7%.\n\nSee our latest analysis for AES  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for AES compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nSo How Is AES' ROCE Trending?\n\nThings have been pretty stable at AES, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect AES to be a multi-bagger going forward. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that AES has been paying out a decent 36% of its earnings to shareholders. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Take On AES' ROCE\n\nIn a nutshell, AES has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Yet to long term shareholders the stock has gifted them an incredible 106% return in the last five years, so the market appears to be rosy about its future. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.\n\nIf you want to know some of the risks facing AES we've found 3 warning signs (2 are concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nWhile AES may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The adjusted earnings also declined 25% from 28 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nThe year-over-year downside can be attributed to the impact of realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps in 2021 and lower contributions from the Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean (MCAC) Strategic Business Unit (SBU).\n\nThe company generated GAAP earnings of 16 cents per share against a loss of 22 cents generated in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nTotal Revenues\n\nTotal revenues came in at $2,852 million in the reported quarter, which improved 8.2% year over year due to higher regulated and non-regulated revenues.

"2022-05-05T23:35:11+00:00","AES (AES) Q1 Earnings Miss Estimates","AES (AES) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.21 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.23 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.28 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -8.70%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this power company would post earnings of $0.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.45, delivering a surprise of 4.65%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nAES , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $2.85 billion for the quarter ended March 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.06%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.64 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nAES shares have lost about 9.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -9.8%.\n\nWhat's Next for AES?\n\nWhile AES has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for AES: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.40 on $2.6 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.61 on $11.04 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the bottom 39% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Vistra Corp. (VST), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2022. The results are expected to be released on May 6.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +105.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 87.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nVistra Corp.'s revenues are expected to be $3.71 billion, up 15.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; and (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence. Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.\n\nAdjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and the tax impact from the repatriation of sales proceeds, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence; and (g) tax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 U.S. tax law reform and related regulations and any subsequent period adjustments related to enactment effects, including the 2021 tax benefit on reversal of uncertain tax positions effectively settled upon the closure of the Company's U.S. tax return exam.\n\nThe GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to AES. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company and are considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, and the non-recurring nature of the impact of the early contract terminations at Angamos, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, for Adjusted PTC, earnings before tax represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS should not be construed as alternatives to income from continuing operations attributable to AES and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which are determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThree Months Ended\r\nMarch 31, 2022 Three Months Ended\r\nMarch 31, 2021 Net of NCI\r\n(1) Per Share\r\n(Diluted)\r\nNet of NCI (1) Net of NCI\r\n(1) Per Share\r\n(Diluted)\r\nNet of NCI (1) (in millions, except per share amounts) Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, attributable to AES and Diluted EPS $ 115 $ 0.16 $ (148) $ (0.22) Add: Income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations attributable to AES 50 (36) Pre-tax contribution $ 165 $ (184) Adjustments Unrealized derivative and equity securities losses $ 41 $ 0.06 (2) $ 69 $ 0.10 (3) Unrealized foreign currency losses (gains) (19) (0.02) (4) 6 0.01 Disposition/acquisition losses (gains) 9 0.01 (15) (0.02) (5) Impairment losses 1 — 475 0.71 (6) Loss on extinguishment of debt 10 0.01 6 0.01 Net gains from early contract terminations at Angamos — — (110) (0.16) (7) Less: Net income tax benefit (0.01) (0.15) (8) Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS $ 207 $ 0.21 $ 247 $ 0.28\n\n(1)  NCI is defined as Noncontrolling Interests.

Subsidiary Distributions should not be construed as an alternative to Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, which is determined in accordance with US GAAP. Subsidiary Distributions are important to the Parent Company because the Parent Company is a holding company that does not derive any significant direct revenues from its own activities but instead relies on its subsidiaries' business activities and the resultant distributions to fund the debt service, investment and other cash needs of the holding company. The reconciliation of the difference between the Subsidiary Distributions and Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities consists of cash generated from operating activities that is retained at the subsidiaries for a variety of reasons which are both discretionary and non-discretionary in nature. These factors include, but are not limited to, retention of cash to fund capital expenditures at the subsidiary, cash retention associated with non-recourse debt covenant restrictions and related debt service requirements at the subsidiaries, retention of cash related to sufficiency of local GAAP statutory retained earnings at the subsidiaries, retention of cash for working capital needs at the subsidiaries, and other similar timing differences between when the cash is generated at the subsidiaries and when it reaches the Parent Company and related holding companies. (2)  Parent Company Liquidity is defined as cash available to the Parent Company, including cash at qualified holding companies (QHCs), plus available borrowings under our existing credit facility. AES believes that unconsolidated Parent Company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a Parent Company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES' indebtedness. (3)  The cash held at QHCs represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the US. Such subsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the Parent Company. Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the US. These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the US. Since the cash held by these QHCs is available to the Parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to Parent and QHCs as a useful measure of cash available to the Parent to meet its international liquidity needs.

"2022-05-05T10:30:21+00:00","Shareholders have faith in loss-making AES (NYSE:AES) as stock climbs 3.9% in past week, taking five-year gain to 124%","The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) shareholders have seen the share price descend 16% over the month. But at least the stock is up over the last five years. In that time, it is up 89%, which isn't bad, but is below the market return of 93%.\n\nSince it's been a strong week for AES shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.\n\nView our latest analysis for AES\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nWe know that AES has been profitable in the past. However, it made a loss in the last twelve months, suggesting profit may be an unreliable metric at this stage. So it might be better to look at other metrics to try to understand the share price.\n\nThe revenue growth of 1.3% per year hardly seems impressive. So why is the share price up? It's not immediately obvious to us, but a closer look at the company's progress over time might yield answers.\n\nThe company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This freereport showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on AES\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of AES, it has a TSR of 124% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe regret to report that AES shareholders are down 15% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 2.8%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 18%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  AES is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAES is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this freelist of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

AES Corporation has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.00%, on average.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nThe solid contracts that AES signed for 5.5 gigawatts of new renewable projects in 2021 might have favorably contributed to the company’s revenues in the quarter to be reported. Moreover, the new businesses at AES Clean Energy, which came online in 2021, and Southland units are likely to add impetus to its first-quarter revenues.\n\nAlso, the growing rate base at U.S. utilities might have favorably contributed to the company’s revenues in the first quarter. Furthermore, Fluence, an AES joint venture with Siemens, is anticipated to have boosted AES Corp’s top line in the first quarter with its strong backlog of energy storage projects.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.64 billion, suggesting an increase of 0.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nThe higher adjusted tax rate and the assumed dilution from planned asset sales are expected to have dampened the bottom line of the company in the first quarter.\n\nHowever, in January 2022, AES Corp acquired the publicly traded shares of AES Andes, bringing its ownership from 67% to 99%. This is likely to have been accretive to AES’ earnings and must have favored its performance in the quarter to be reported, thus partially mitigating the negative impact on earnings to some extent.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earningsis pegged at 23 cents per share, indicating a decline of 17.9% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nThe AES Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The AES Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nThe AES Corporation price-eps-surprise | The AES Corporation Quote\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for AES Corporation this time.

"2022-04-29T19:00:07+00:00","Analysts Estimate AES (AES) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for","AES (AES) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 6, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -17.9%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $2.64 billion, up 0.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.11% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nPrice, Consensus and EPS Surprise Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for AES\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AES?\n\nFor AES, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AES will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that AES would post earnings of $0.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.45, delivering a surprise of +4.65%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nAES doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"2022-03-14T19:01:07+00:00","AES Corporation, (The) -- Moody's places the ratings of AES Corporation on review for upgrade","Rating Action: Moody's places the ratings of AES Corporation on review for upgradeGlobal Credit Research - 14 Mar 2022Approximately $4.4 billion of rated instruments affectedNew York, March 14, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") placed the ratings of The AES Corporation (AES) ratings on review for upgrade, including its Ba1 corporate family rating (CFR), Ba1-PD probability of default rating, and Ba3 preferred stock rating (see full debt list below). AES's SGL-2 speculative grade liquidity rating remains unchanged.RATINGS RATIONALE / FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS""The review for upgrade will assess AES Corporation's ability to generate strong and consistent credit metrics including a consolidated ratio of CFO pre-W/C to net debt above 14%, on a sustained basis"" said Natividad Martel, Vice President -- Senior Analyst. ""The deconsolidation of the Chilean hydroelectric project Alto Maipo following its pre-negotiated bankruptcy proceeding in November 2021 contributed to a material improvement in the metrics of AES in 2021, a key driver of the review"" added Martel.The review will also consider the updated decarbonization strategy of AES, a key environmental consideration and an important driver of the organization's credit quality going forward. The review will assess how the company's plans to fund elevated investments in renewables, and to a lesser extent natural gas, will impact consolidated financial performance. The review will also consider how much these investments will contribute to the growth of its US operations in terms of both cash flow and EBITDA and the extent to which this will lower the company's business risk. We will also evaluate management's recently accelerated goal of fully exiting all coal-fired generation by year-end 2025 and the impact this will have on the company's credit profile. We had previously expected that AES would run some coal-fired generation beyond 2025.ESG ConsiderationsThe Credit Impact Score of AES is CIS-3 (moderately negative), where its ESG attributes are overall considered as having a limited impact on the current rating. The CIS-3 reflects moderately negative exposure to environmental and social risks along with neutral to low governance risks.AES' moderately negative environmental risks (E-3 issuer profile score) reflect its still high exposure to coal-fired and natural gas fired generation which results in high carbon transition risk. This risk is mitigated by the company's long-term contracted power generation operations and its accelerated decarbonization strategy that includes material investments in renewables amid management's intention to exit of all coal-fired generation activities by year-end 2025. Another factor that weighs on AES' environmental risk is the company's exposure to physical climate risk, although this is offset by the group's geographically diversified operations with subsidiaries operating in fourteen countries.LiquidityThe Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating (SGL) of SGL-2 reflects good liquidity from both strong internal cash flow generation and external cash sources. At year-end 2021, AES had $837 million available under its $1.25 billion committed revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in September 2026. The credit facility is not subject to any conditionality, including a material adverse change clause representation for borrowings, a credit positive. The facility is subject to one financial covenant, namely a maximum recourse debt to cash flow ratio of not more than 5.75x (both metrics calculated on a parent only basis). We anticipate that AES will remain in compliance with substantial headroom.The SGL-2 also factors in our expectation that AES' consolidated free cash flow will remain negative as a result of the group's material investments. However, our analysis also considers management's expectation that the company will continue to report positive free cash flow at the parent level. During the 2022-2025 period, AES expects to have access to around $6.3 billion of discretionary cash that includes nearly $4 billion of parent free cash flow (dividends received minus parent company costs such as interest payments) and total net proceeds from asset sales of $1 billion (including $500 million related to not yet announced sales). AES also updated its planned holding company debt issuance forecast to around $1.3 billion during the 2022-2025 period following $1 billion convertible preferred stock issued in March 2021. AES has also disclosed that it plans to use these funds to make $3.8 billion of equity contributions to its subsidiaries and to distribute around $2 billion during the 2022-2025 period. AES' next parent debt maturity consists of $900 million due in 2025.On Review for Upgrade:..Issuer: AES Corporation, (The).... Corporate Family Rating, Placed on Review for Upgrade, currently Ba1....

"2022-03-07T22:56:26+00:00","Corporate Insiders Go Big on These 2 “Strong Buy” Stocks","The hot war in Ukraine continues, pitting the smaller country’s stubborn resistance against Russia’s bigger battalions. The Western nations have responded with economic sanctions against Russia, the aggressor, and the sanctions have triggered higher volatility and sharp losses in global stock markets. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 is down 2.95% today, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ has fallen 3.6%. Year-to-date, the indexes are down 12% and 18%, respectively.\n\nDespite these overall losses, investors can still find some strong buys in the markets – if they know which signals to follow. While the trends now are downward, some stocks are getting primed for forward gains, but those signs might not be clearly visible. Insiders will know what to look for – and fortunately for the retail investor, the insiders are required to publish their trading activity regularly.\n\nThese insiders are the company officers of the public firms. They hold high positions – as CEOs, as CFOs and COOs, as executive VPs, and as Board members – and those positions give them a clearer view of what’s ‘under the hood’ at their firms. At the same time, they are responsible for keeping those companies profitable, and Boards of Directors and shareholders can hold them to the fire. This means that corporate insiders don’t trade their own stock lightly – so we can follow their trades, for clues to forward performance.\n\nWe’ve done just that, using the Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool at TipRanks to find a couple of equities that the insiders are picking up. There are other positive signifiers to follow; these stocks are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus and are projected to pick up steam in the months ahead. Let’s take a closer look.\n\nAES Corporation(AES)\n\nThe first stock we’ll look at is AES Corporation, a leading power company. The Virginia-based firm employs more than 10,000 people around the world, and generates and distributes power in 15 countries. The company operates in the US, as well as South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. In 2021, AES built or acquired over 2,000 megawatts of renewable power generation, and currently has a backlog of 9,239 megawatts under construction or contract through the year 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report, for 4Q21, AES showed $2.77 billion at the top line, up 8.2% from the year-ago revenue of $2.56 billion. On earnings, AES reported 45 cents per share in adjusted APS. This was down from the 48 cents reported one year ago, but slightly beat the forecast.\n\nFor the full year 2021, the company reported adjusted EPS of $1.52. This was at the low end of the original guidance range ($1.50 to $1.58), but higher than the 2020 earnings of $1.44 per share. Looking ahead, AES expects 2022 adjusted EPS to fall between $1.55 and $1.65 per share.\n\nOn the insider front, the company CFO Stephen Coughlin made a million-dollar purchase this month, picking up 47,000 shares at $21.30 each. This brings his full holding in the company to more than $1.4 million.\n\nCovering AES for Morgan Stanley, 5-star analyst Stephen Byrd appreciates the company’s strong bent toward benefitting shareholders, writing: ""We view management as being especially focused on enhancing shareholder value through a combination of attractive growth investments, monetizing assets with under-appreciated value, and becoming a pure-play ESG story through an aggressive decarbonization strategy that has resulted in significant, tangible reductions in fossil emissions.”\n\n""AES is in our view the most attractive risk-adjusted play among our clean energy coverage universe driven by significant existing asset/business value which is now close to 100% of the stock price, one of the largest renewables/storage development businesses globally, and several positive catalysts,"" Byrd added.\n\nIt’s not surprising, then, that Byrd gives AES shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, along with a $30.50 price target. This figure suggests room for ~39% upside in the next 12 months. (To watch Byrd’s track record, click here)\n\nIt’s clear from the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating that Wall Street is in broad agreement on the bullish view here; 7 recent reviews all agree that this is a stock to Buy. The shares are priced at $21.87 and have an average price target of $28.50, implying ~30% one-year upside. (See AES stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\nMiX Telematics(MIXT)\n\nThe second stock on our list is MiX Telematics, a major name in fleet management. Telematics is a technical term, for methods of monitoring cars, trucks, and other mobile assets through on-board diagnostics and/or GPS tech. MiX offers this type of fleet and mobile asset management, with offices in South Africa, the US, the UK, Australia, Mexico, Brazil, Uganda, and the UAE. The company’s worldwide network includes more than 130 fleet partners in more than 120 countries. MiX boasts over 790,000 service subscribers, and subscriptions make up 89% of the company’s revenue.\n\nMiX’s fleet tracking services include reporting and live streams, and offers customers the ability to fine-tune vehicle fleet operations to improve fuel efficiency. The company can provide electronic logging devices, AI dashcams, journey management, and even a driver engagement app.\n\nLast month, MiX reported its third quarter results for fiscal 2022. The company showed $36.2 million in total revenues, up 6.2% year-over-year, of which $30.3 million came from subscription services, a 4.3% y/y gain. Net subscribers grew by 20,300 during the quarter. MiX had $35.9 million in liquid assets at the end of the quarter.\n\nInsider sentiment on MiX is positive, pushed that way by three recent ‘informative buys.’ The smallest of them was for $28,905, by EVP Catherine Lewis. A larger buy, of $280,385, was made by EVP Gert Pretorius, who bought over 1.2 million shares. The largest recent insider purchase came from Ian Jacobs, of the Board of Directors, who bought 2.5 million shares for $1.175 million.\n\nCanaccord's Michael Walkley is also a fan of MiX. The 5-star analyst rates the stock a Buy, along with a $22 price target, indicating confidence in a 91% upside going forward. (To watch Walkley’s track record, click here)\n\nWalkley is optimistic about MiX’s forward prospects, and writes of the company: “MiX reported Q3/22 results better than our estimates on revenue, demonstrating its business trends continue to recover. With the impact of the global pandemic negatively impacting the oil & gas vertical combined with ongoing softness in the bus and coach industry, we believe the results demonstrate the business is starting to recover and expect steadily recovering subscription revenue growth trends through F2022 with stronger growth in F2023 and beyond. We believe the global opportunity for fleet management solutions remains strong longer term with low penetration levels, and we expect continued steady improvement in subscription growth and margins post the pandemic.”\n\nOverall, MiX has picked up 3 recent reviews, all of which are positive – making the consensus a unanimous Strong Buy. Shares are selling for $11.52 and the $19 average price target implies ~65% upside in the coming year.

"2022-02-24T23:30:11+00:00","AES (AES) Q4 Earnings and Revenues Surpass Estimates","AES (AES) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.43 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.48 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.65%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this power company would post earnings of $0.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.50, delivering a surprise of 11.11%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nAES , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $2.77 billion for the quarter ended December 2021, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.48%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.56 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nAES shares have lost about 15.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -11.3%.\n\nWhat's Next for AES?\n\nWhile AES has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for AES: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.31 on $2.79 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.65 on $10.94 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the bottom 22% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Algonquin Power & Utilities (AQN), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2021. The results are expected to be released on March 3.\n\nThis utility operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.21 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nAlgonquin Power & Utilities' revenues are expected to be $594.36 million, up 20.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Accelerating the future of energy, together. (PRNewsfoto/The AES Corporation)\n\n""Last year was AES' best year ever, in terms of safety, new renewables PPAs signed, growth in our backlog of projects and pipeline, earnings and cash flow,"" said Andrés Gluski, AES President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We signed 5 GW of new PPAs to consolidate our position as the fastest growing US renewables developer and the largest supplier of corporate renewables contracts in the world. Our backlog of projects stands at 9.2 GW and our pipeline of potential projects grew to 59 GW. These results reflect the resiliency of our people, supply chains and customer relationships in the midst of the global COVID pandemic. To continue to accelerate the future of energy, today, we are announcing our intent to exit coal generation by the end of 2025. We are committed to completing the transformation of AES, while maintaining our guidance and delivering strong financial results.""\n\nStory continues\n\n""We delivered on our strategic and financial objectives in 2021, including Adjusted EPS1 of $1.52, compared to our guidance of $1.50 to $1.58. I am proud that our team was able to overcome most of the $0.07 per share non-cash impact from the share count change related to the equity units issued in March 2021,"" said Stephen Coughlin, AES Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ""We are reaffirming our annualized growth target of 7% to 9% through 2025 and initiating 2022 Adjusted EPS1 guidance of $1.55 to $1.65. Our portfolio's performance remains strong, and our renewables growth is accelerating, opening up pathways for us to meet our new aim to exit coal by the end of 2025.""\n\nKey Full Year 2021 Financial Results\n\nFull year 2021 Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations (Diluted EPS) was ($0.62), a decrease of $0.68 compared to full year 2020, primarily reflecting the deconsolidation of Alto Maipo, higher impairments, and lower contributions from Brazil. These negative drivers were partially offset by higher margins at the US and Utilities, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean (MCAC), and Eurasia Strategic Business Units (SBU) and lower Parent Company interest expense. The Company also benefited from gains on the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Fluence and on remeasurement of the Company's interest in sPower's development platform.\n\nFull year 2021 Adjusted Earnings Per Share1 (Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure) was $1.52, an increase of $0.08, primarily driven by contributions from new renewables in the US, and better operating performance at existing businesses at the US and Utilities, MCAC, and Eurasia SBUs, as well as lower Parent Company interest expense. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower contributions from the South America SBU, and the impact of the inclusion of shares underlying the forward purchase contract component of the Company's March 2021 equity units issuance.\n\nDetailed Strategic Highlights\n\nAES is leading the industry's transition to clean energy by investing in clean power and innovative technology businesses. The Company is well-positioned to benefit from very favorable trends in clean power generation, distribution, and supporting technologies.\n\nIn 2021, the Company completed construction of or the acquisition of 2,079 MW of renewables and energy storage, primarily including: Since the Company's third quarter 2021 earnings call in November, the Company has signed or acquired 978 MW of renewables and energy storage under long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPA). In full year 2021, the Company signed or agreed to acquire 4,965 MW of renewables and energy storage under long-term PPAs, bringing the Company's backlog to 9,239 MW expected to be completed through 2025, including: Fluence completed its IPO in November 2021 (Nasdaq: FLNC). Following the IPO, the Company's ownership interest in Fluence is approximately 34% (on a fully diluted basis). The Company intends to exit coal by 2025, through a combination of asset sales, fuel conversions and retirements, while maintaining reliability and affordability, and subject to necessary approvals. Previously, the Company expected to reduce its generation from coal to less than 10% of total generation by year-end 2025. The Company currently has 7.1 GW of coal generation in operation across its portfolio.\n\nGuidance and Expectations1\n\nThe Company is reaffirming its 7% to 9% annualized growth rate target through 2025, from a base year of 2020. This growth rate includes the impact of the Company's accelerated intent to exit coal by year-end 2025, which is expected to be largely offset by increased contributions from higher ownership of AES Andes, as well as continued higher growth in renewables. Previously, the Company expected to reduce its generation from coal to less than 10% of total generation by year-end 2025. From 2022 through 2025, the Company expects to receive $1 billion in asset sale proceeds, compared to its prior expectation of receiving $500 million of asset sale proceeds.\n\nThe Company is initiating 2022 guidance for Adjusted EPS1 of $1.55 to $1.65. Growth in 2022 is expected to be primarily driven by increased contributions from higher ownership of AES Andes, as well as continued higher growth in renewables and from existing operations. This growth is expected to be partially offset by a higher adjusted tax rate, the full year impact from a higher share count due to the inclusion of shares underlying the purchase contract component of the Company's March 2021 equity units issuance, and assumed dilution from asset sales. In 2022, the Company expects to receive $500 million to $700 million in asset sale proceeds, largely reflecting its accelerated decarbonization strategy.\n\nAdditionally, the Company previously expected the pending distribution rate case at DPL in Ohio to be resolved early in 2022; however, it is now expected to be resolved later in the year, and therefore only a small contribution has been assumed in the Company's guidance.\n\nThe Company's 2022 guidance is based on foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of December 31, 2021.\n\n1 Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. See attached ""Non-GAAP Measures"" for definition of Adjusted EPS and a description of the adjustments to reconcile Adjusted EPS to Diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent or reconciliation for its Adjusted EPS guidance without unreasonable effort.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nSee Non-GAAP Measures for definitions of Adjusted Earnings Per Share and Adjusted Pre-Tax Contribution, as well as reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nAttachments\n\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Segment Information, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Parent Financial Information.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nAES will host a conference call on Friday, February 24, 2022 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST).

"2022-02-21T15:58:03+00:00","What's in Store for American Electric (AEP) in Q4 Earnings?","American Electric Power Company, Inc AEP is slated to release its fourth-quarter 2021 results on Feb 24, 2022 before the opening bell.\n\nIn the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.69%. American Electric has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.61%, on average.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nDuring most of the fourth quarter, AEP’s service territories witnessed mixed weather patterns. While some parts observed cooler-than-normal temperatures along with slight snowfall, other parts had warm weather and extreme drought conditions.\n\nFurthermore, some parts of its service territories experienced significant precipitation levels throughout the quarter, resulting in wet weather conditions. Also, severe weather conditions, along with tornadoes, may have had disrupted the smooth flow of electricity to its customers. This is likely to have negatively impacted the company’s overall revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nHowever, favorable rate changes across its multiple jurisdiction might have resulted in increased transmission revenues and higher off-system sales. This, in turn, is likely to have bolstered the fourth quarter’s top line.\n\nAlso, the rebounding commercial and industrial load due to the economic recovery observed over the past few months might have favorably contributed to the company’s performance in the quarter to be reported.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $4.02 billion, suggesting growth of 11.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nHowever, American Electric’s service territories, which experienced severe weather patterns, including tornadoes in the fourth quarter, may have witnessed infrastructural damage. This, in turn, may have increased the company’s operating expenses for restoration and repairing, which is likely to have weighed on its bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nHowever, the company continues to manage its costs diligently. Such cost management initiatives may have partially offset the unfavorable impacts of the aforementioned expenses. Also, higher margins, along with lower net interest expenses and income taxes, may have aided the company’s performance in the fourth quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earningsis pegged at 94 cents per share, indicating growth of 8.1% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nAmerican Electric Power Company, Inc.

"2022-02-17T20:02:08+00:00","Analysts Estimate AES (AES) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for","Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when AES (AES) reports results for the quarter ended December 2021. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10.4%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $2.53 billion, down 1.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AES?\n\nFor AES, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.75%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AES will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that AES would post earnings of $0.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.50, delivering a surprise of +11.11%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nAES doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"2022-02-03T00:30:56+00:00","Did The Smart Money Get The AES Corporation (AES) Right?","Insider Monkey has processed numerous 13F filings of hedge funds and successful value investors to create an extensive database of hedge fund holdings. The 13F filings show the hedge funds' and successful investors' positions as of the end of the third quarter. You can find articles about an individual hedge fund's trades on numerous financial news websites. However, in this article we will take a look at their collective moves over the last 6 years and analyze what the smart money thinks of The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) based on that data and determine whether they were really smart about the stock.\n\nThe AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) was in 47 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of September. The all time high for this statistic is 51. AES has experienced an increase in enthusiasm from smart money of late. There were 39 hedge funds in our database with AES positions at the end of the second quarter. Our calculations also showed that AES isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q3 rankings).\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, lithium prices have more than doubled over the past year, so we go through lists like the 10 best EV stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. Now let's take a glance at the latest hedge fund action surrounding The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES).\n\nWilliam Gray of Orbis Investment Management\n\nDo Hedge Funds Think AES Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?\n\nAt the end of the third quarter, a total of 47 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a change of 21% from one quarter earlier. On the other hand, there were a total of 32 hedge funds with a bullish position in AES a year ago. So, let's examine which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey's hedge fund database, William B. Gray's Orbis Investment Management has the biggest position in The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), worth close to $316 million, comprising 2.2% of its total 13F portfolio. The second most bullish fund manager is Electron Capital Partners, led by Jos Shaver, holding a $226.2 million position; 12% of its 13F portfolio is allocated to the stock. Remaining peers that hold long positions encompass John Smith Clark's Southpoint Capital Advisors, Stuart J. Zimmer's Zimmer Partners and Dan Loeb's Third Point. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Electron Capital Partners allocated the biggest weight to The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), around 11.96% of its 13F portfolio. SW Investment Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, dishing out 6.81 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to AES.\n\nConsequently, some big names have jumped into The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) headfirst. Point72 Asset Management, managed by Steve Cohen, established the largest position in The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES). Point72 Asset Management had $27.7 million invested in the company at the end of the quarter. Franklin Parlamis's Aequim Alternative Investments also made a $11.5 million investment in the stock during the quarter. The other funds with brand new AES positions are Ryan Tolkin (CIO)'s Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, Frank Fu's CaaS Capital, and Andrew Weiss's Weiss Asset Management.\n\nLet's also examine hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES). These stocks are Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY), Arch Capital Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:ACGL), Smith & Nephew plc (NYSE:SNN), Avalara, Inc. (NYSE:AVLR), Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE:ELAN), Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP), and Doximity Inc. (NYSE:DOCS). This group of stocks' market valuations match AES's market valuation.\n\n[table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position INCY,37,3295444,3 ACGL,31,1214570,9 SNN,19,106245,6 AVLR,24,1070703,-5 ELAN,32,1850148,-10 CHKP,30,621231,1 DOCS,19,554548,19 Average,27.4,1244698,3.3 [/table]\n\nView table here if you experience formatting issues.\n\nAs you can see these stocks had an average of 27.4 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $1245 million. That figure was $1481 million in AES's case. Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Smith & Nephew plc (NYSE:SNN) is the least popular one with only 19 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is more popular among hedge funds. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for AES is 87.6. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 29.6% in 2021 and still beat the market by 3.6 percentage points. Unfortunately, AES wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks and hedge funds that were betting on AES were disappointed as the stock returned -1.6% since the end of the third quarter (through 1/31) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as all of these stocks already outperformed the market since 2019.\n\nGet real-time email alerts: Follow Aes Corp (NYSE:AES)\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 Psychedelic Startups Investors are Flocking To 25 Most Subscribed YouTube Channels in 2021 30 Highest Paying Jobs with an Associate's Degree in 2021\n\nDisclosure: None.

"2022-01-10T15:18:07+00:00","Mercury Chile HoldCo LLC -- Moody's assigns first-time Ba1 rating to Mercury Chile' new notes; outlook stable","Rating Action: Moody's assigns first-time Ba1 rating to Mercury Chile' new notes; outlook stableGlobal Credit Research - 10 Jan 2022Up to $425 million of debt securities ratedNew York, January 10, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") today assigned a first-time Ba1 rating to Mercury Chile Holdco LLC's (Mercury) proposed senior secured guaranteed notes issuance of up to $425 million. The rating outlook is stable.The assigned ratings are based on preliminary documentation. Moody's does not anticipate changes in the main conditions that the notes will carry. Should issuance conditions and/or final documentation deviate from the original ones submitted and reviewed by the rating agency, Moody's will assess the impact that these differences may have on the rating and act accordingly.Mercury, the indirect parent company of Inversiones Cachagua SpA (""Cachagua"") and AES Andes S.A. (AES Andes, Baa3 stable), plans to use the proceeds raised in connection with the notes issuance to prepay a same-sized bridge loan. The group used this bridge loan along with an equity contribution received from the ultimate parent company, AES Corporation (The) (AES; Ba1 positive) to pay the tender offer consideration of approximately $517 million and related transaction costs. As a result of the tender offer, the indirect and direct interests in AES Andes held by AES, Mercury and Cachagua, the offerer, increased to 98.13% from around 67%.The notes will be unconditionally guaranteed by four intermediate companies in-between AES and AES Andes, including Cachagua, Mercury Chile Co II Ltd, Invesiones LK SpA, and Omega SpA. We understand that these intermediate holding parent companies between Mercury and AES Andes will remain unencumbered. The notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest in the around 31.2% shares acquired in the tender offer. Concurrently, the negative covenants clause embedded in the proposed notes includes a negative pledge over all shares of AES Andes held by Mercury other than the shares representing the around 31.2% new interest in the power generation company.RATINGS RATIONALEMercury's Ba1 senior secured rating reflects the structurally subordinated position of Mercury's proposed notes issuance vis-à-vis the senior unsecured debt outstanding at the power generation company AES Andes.In the absence of material ring-fencing provisions, AES Andes' cash distributions are the only source of cash flow to service the intermediate holding companies' debt. The proposed notes (i) limit both the financial flexibility of AES Andes and its intermediate parent companies, and (ii) constrain this operational subsidiary's credit quality, while it also (iii) drives the notch differential between AES Andes' senior unsecured rating (Baa3) and Mercury's senior secured notes (Ba1). The differential in the notching between the proposed notes and AES Andes' senior unsecured rating considers our expectation that the ratio of debt outstanding at the intermediate companies (including Mercury and the intermediary holding companies) to total consolidated debt will remain below 20%.The structural subordination considerations also factor in the Minimum Legally Required Dividends that applies in Chile. Moody's understands that this requirement will continue to apply to AES Andes should it be fully privatized. Unless unanimously agreed otherwise by AES, and any remaining minority shareholders, AES Andes must distribute a cash dividend on a yearly basis of at least 30% of the net consolidated profits from the previous year, except for when accumulated losses from prior years must still be absorbed. It also considers that the interest payments due under AES Andes' 2079 junior subordinated notes (Ba2 stable) may be deferred in order for AES Andes to meet this legal dividend requirement, which underpins Moody's expectations that the Obligors will be able to comfortably meet the annual interest payments of around $18 million due under the proposed notes.AES Andes' exposure to decarbonization risk amid the legal uncertainty around the final retirement date of its coal-fired facilities temper the rating. However, the Ba1 rating assumes further progress in the group's Greentegra strategy to grow the long-term contracted renewables footprint, reduce its carbon transition risk and strengthen the group's business risk profile. AES Andes' aggressive dividend policy that targets to distribute 100% of its recurrent net income tempers our credit view of the financial policies. However, Moody's assumes that AES Andes will fund its dividend distributions to the ultimate parent company AES with available free cash flows after the subsidiaries' scheduled debt repayments and that it will not incur incremental debt to fund its dividend distributions.The Ba1 rating and stable outlook are premised on the expectation that Moody's-adjusted ratio of Mercury consolidated credit metrics will remain supportive of the group's credit quality, including a Moody's adjusted ratio of CFO pre-W/C to debt of at least 22% and debt/EBITDA of 3.5x in 2022 and 2023. These credit metrics include Mercury's obligations of up to $425 million and AES Andes' reported leverage adjusted with the application of proportional consolidation of certain not-wholly owned subsidiaries. Also, the adjusted consolidated debt currently reflects a hybrid equity credit that results related to the basket ""C"" treatment applied to AES Andes' $1 billion junior subordinated notes.Moody's acknowledges the secured nature of Mercury's obligations. However, the collateral consists only of the around 33% interest in shares of AES Andes, which in Moody's view limits the expected recovery value for the Obligor's noteholders under a material financial distress of AES Andes.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGFACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADEUpward pressure on Mercury's rating is likely following an upgrade of AES Andes' senior unsecured rating. Assuming AES Andes makes progress in the implementation of its Greentegra strategy, and more certainty is gained regarding an orderly retirement of its coal-fired fleet in Chile, including securing replacement power for Alto Maipo. An upgrade of the ratings of Mercury and AES Andes would also depend on the Moody's-adjusted ratio of Mercury consolidated CFO pre-W/C to debt remaining in excess of 25%, on a sustained basis.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADEDownward pressure on Mercury's rating is likely following a downgrade of AES Andes' senior unsecured rating. In the absence of a deterioration in AES Andes' business risk profile, Moody's could downgrade the rating of Mercury and AES Andes if Moody's-adjusted ratio of CFO pre-W/C to debt, calculated for Mercury on a consolidated basis, falls below 20% or if the retained cash flow to debt remains less than 15%, both on a sustained basis. A negative rating action could also occur if management is not able to address the residual impact of the Alto Maipo bankruptcy in a credit-neutral manner.Mercury and the guarantors are intermediate holding companies that do not have any material assets or liabilities other than their indirect and direct interests in the Chilean power generation company AES Andes. The guarantors of note are Mercury Chile Co II Ltd. (Cayman Islands) as well as the Chilean companies Inversiones LK SpA, Omega SpA and Cachagua.Assignments:..Issuer: Mercury Chile HoldCo LLC....Gtd Senior Secured Regular Bond/Debenture, Assigned Ba1Outlook Actions:.....Outlook, Assigned StableThe principal methodology used in this rating was Unregulated Utilities and Unregulated Power Companies published in May 2017 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1066389.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Money-Making Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nThe past year reflected significant revisions in assumptions about the pandemic's duration and its repercussions on consumers and companies. The uncertainty led to many seeking passive sources of income. According to McKinsey, numerous major corporations opt to return unneeded cash to shareholders on a regular basis, with share repurchases used to make up the gap between the total payout and dividends. While some businesses don't have explicit published policies in place, you may infer them from their actions. For example, IBM earned $48 billion in cash flow from operations after capital expenditures and acquisitions in the five years ending in 2010 and returned $56 billion to shareholders.\n\nFirms have conditioned investors, particularly in the United States, to expect dividend cuts only in the most severe of circumstances. Only 5% of US-listed firms with revenues higher than $500 million decreased their dividend between 2004 and 2008, and practically all of them were in the midst of a severe recession. For mainstream asset managers, private markets ranked as the strongest dealmaking sector in 2021, as they tried to capitalize on the appeal of growth strategies among yield-seeking investors while raising longer-dated capital with higher fees than public markets strategies.\n\nDay trading has reached unprecedented heights as a result of the inflow of ordinary investors into the market. With the recent example of a short squeeze of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME), it is evident that individuals are seeking to make fortunes out of increased volatility. Keeping in view these circumstances, some of the popular money-making stocks to buy now include Equitable Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EQH), The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), and Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT).\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on UnsplashOur Methodology\n\nThe stocks mentioned in this article offer decent dividends as well as potential long-term stock price appreciation.\n\nBusiness fundamentals, analyst ratings, and growth catalysts were among the key indicators used to pick these stocks. The stocks have further been sorted in ascending order in terms of the hedge funds invested in them.
