"2022-07-07T06:00:00+00:00","Rock Tech wins thyssenkrupp Materials Trading as potential supplier of raw materials and customer for its lithium hydroxide","VANCOUVER, BC, July 7, 2022 /CNW/ - Rock Tech Lithium Inc. (TSXV: RCK) (OTCQX: RCKTF) (FWB: RJIB) (WKN: A1XF0V) (""Rock Tech"" or the ""Company"") has entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (the ""MOU"") with materials distributor and service provider thyssenkrupp Materials Trading GmbH (""thyssenkrupp Materials Trading"") in relation to establishing a strategic partnership to supply lithium spodumene concentrate. Rock Tech plans to refine the mineral from the end of 2024 at its proposed converter in Guben, Germany, into high-purity lithium hydroxide, a key element in batteries for electric cars and plug-in hybrids. Rock Tech Lithium Inc. (CNW Group/Rock Tech Lithium Inc.)\n\nThe MOU between the two companies also includes a framework relating to the purchase of high-purity lithium hydroxide by thyssenkrupp Materials Trading for the battery market, as well as other by-products resulting from the refining process. Thus, the potential partnership is expected to promote a more resilient supply chain for lithium directly out of Germany, from raw material sourcing, to refining, to meeting demand of the automotive industry and growing electromobility demands.\n\nMarkus Brügmann, Rock Tech's chief executive officer says: ""With thyssenkrupp Materials Trading we have found al global logistics and trading partner that gives us further security in the supply of spodumene. This is expected to give us a broader base for our input stream, which would take us a big step forward on the road to success.""\n\nWolfgang Schnittker, chief executive officer of thyssenkrupp Materials Trading, says: ""The potential partnership with Rock Tech underlines the systematic expansion of our global trading activities in the international battery and electric vehicles industry. The trading of lithium products would add another very important raw material to our supply portfolio for the production of long-life batteries.""\n\nSpodumene is one of the most important raw materials, amongst others, for the production of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles. For this purpose, the spodumene mineral must be refined into lithium hydroxide, which can then be supplied to cathode manufacturers for the battery industry worldwide. Cathodes are essential components of battery cells. The lithium spodumene concentrate will be used in Rock Tech's first converter in Guben, Germany, which is expected to produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide from 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nABOUT THYSSENKRUPP MATERIAL SERVICES\n\nthyssenkrupp Materials Services is the largest mill-independent materials distributor and service provider in the Western world, with around 380 locations - including around 260 warehouse sites - in more than 30 countries.

"2022-06-27T11:00:00+00:00","American Lithium validates Sulfate of Potash as a strategic by-product of future lithium production at Falchani","American Lithium Corp.\n\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia, June 27, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Lithium Corp. (“American Lithium” or the “Company”) (TSX-V:LI | OTCQB:LIACF | Frankfurt:5LA1) is pleased to announce the successful precipitation of high purity, fertilizer-quality potassium sulfate (“SOP”-sulfate of potash) by-product from the Company’s Falchani Project. Testing confirms that in addition to producing high quality lithium compounds, SOP can be produced to potentially supply Peru with its domestic needs. Testing was completed at Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (“ANSTO”) Minerals Business Unit laboratories in Sydney, Australia. The SOP produced by ANSTO from Falchani mineralization is 45% potassium (“K”) and 20% sulfur (“S”) and falls within the specification parameters of SOP marketed by various producers and traders of K-based fertilizers.\n\nHighlights:\n\nANSTO’s work to date validates the ability to produce high quality SOP at Falchani, while continuing to refine flowsheet options and realizing the lithium and by-product value contained within the deposit. As part of the SOP production validation test work, the cesium and rubidium extracted in the upfront acid leach have been separated from lithium and work is on-going to realize the significance of these two critical elements. Once all by-products are validated, ANSTO will optimize the Falchani flow sheet to maximize the precipitation of lithium carbonate while enabling significant by-product production. The existing Falchani PEA will be updated for these by-products and associated revenue implications. Recent shortages of fertilizers in Peru, with imports of SOP rising to over 60,000 tonnes per year, highlight the strategic importance of developing significant domestic sources of supply.\n\nDr. Laurence Stefan, COO of American Lithium, states, “The strategic importance of the ability to produce significant amounts of SOP from Falchani cannot be overstated. This by-product will not only provide an additional potential revenue stream at Falchani, but more importantly will also provide a major source of domestic SOP for Peru with the potential to largely reduce the country’s dependence on imported overseas fertilizers. Falchani has the potential to ultimately make Peru self-sufficient for the SOP fertilizers required to produce the high-value crops, fruit and vegetables that are major exports for Peru. At the same time, the Company continues to refine its flowsheet to maximize its ability to extract Cesium and Rubidium, also critical minerals and potential by-products to further enhance the Falchani project.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe current test work program at ANSTO builds on previous programs which have demonstrated the ability to produce battery grade lithium carbonate from the Falchani mineralization. This latest program has pursued to modify the baseline flowsheet to allow the recovery of SOP, and cesium and rubidium by-products.\n\nThe definition of the SOP, and cesium and rubidium recovery circuits has been performed with a ~20 kg sample of representative / bulk Falchani feed material. In the baseline flowsheet for Falchani, potassium alum is crystallized from the resultant pregnant leach solution (PLS). This potassium alum is the feed material for the SOP, and cesium and rubidium recovery circuits and does not impact the downstream purification and lithium carbonate precipitation circuits.\n\nTable 1 - ANSTO Minerals Table of Analyses for Basic and Refined SOP Element Basic K product (wt%)\r\n(1st pass SOP) Refined K product (wt%)\r\n(2nd pass SOP) Al 0.04 <0.01 Ca <0.01 <0.01 Fe <0.01 <0.01 Li <0.01 <0.01 Na <0.04 <0.01 Ni <0.01 <0.01 P <0.01 <0.01 S 20 20 Si <0.05 <0.05 Zn <0.01 <0.01 K 45 45 Rb 0.62 0.16 Cs <0.01 <0.01 Rb/K (%) 1.4 0.35 Cs/K (%) <0.02 <0.02 Cs/Rb (%) <1.7 <6.5\n\nAbout Peru SOP requirements & Falchani Potential\r\nPeru imports the entire amount of SOP needed for its agricultural sector, mainly for high-value crops that play a very important role in the balance of Peruvian agricultural exports. The fertilizer crisis generated by the war in Ukraine has exacerbated shortages in the fertilizer market, its transport, distribution and increased fertilizer prices to unprecedented levels and is linked to accelerating the sharp price increase of fruit, vegetables, livestock feed etc., in the country. The large amounts of SOP that American Lithium could potentially produce from Falchani could cover the SOP needs of Peru when compared with pre-pandemic requirements, with the possibility of Peru becoming a net fertilizer exporter at full capacity.\n\nQualified Person\r\nMr. Ted O’Connor, P.Geo., a Director of American Lithium, and a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, has reviewed and approved the scientific and technical information contained in this news release.\n\nCompletion of Acquisition of Highly Prospective concessions near Falchani in Southern Peru \r\nThe Company has also completed its recently announced acquisition of additional highly prospective concessions (14,243 hectares) in Southern Peru near to its existing Projects. In consideration for the additional concessions, the Company has paid US$400,000 and issued 2,250,000 common shares to an arms-length vendor. The shares issued are subject to restrictions on resale until October 22, 2022 in accordance with applicable securities laws.\n\nAbout ANSTO Minerals\r\nANSTO Minerals is an international mining consultancy group located in Sydney, Australia, with an experienced team of 60+ engineers, metallurgists, chemists, and scientists who have been providing consulting services and process development services to the mining and minerals processing industries for well over 35 years.

Investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Cautionary Note Regarding Macusani Concessions Thirty-two of the 151 concessions held by American Lithium’s subsidiary Macusani, are currently subject to Administrative and Judicial processes (together, the “Processes”) in Peru to overturn resolutions issued by INGEMMET and the Mining Council of MINEM in February 2019 and July 2019, respectively, which declared Macusani’s title to 32 of the concessions invalid due to late receipt of the annual validity payments. In November 2019, Macusani applied for injunctive relief on 32 concessions in a Court in Lima, Peru and was successful in obtaining such an injunction on 17 of the concessions including three of the four concessions included in the Macusani Uranium Project PEA. The grant of the Precautionary Measure (Medida Cautelar) has restored the title, rights and validity of those 17 concessions to Macusani until a final decision is obtained at the last stage of the judicial process. A Precautionary Measure application was made at the same time for the remaining 15 concessions and was ultimately granted by a Court in Lima, Peru on March 2, 2021 which has also restored the title, rights and validity of those 15 remaining concessions to Macusani, with the result being that all 32 concessions are now protected by Precautionary Measure (Medida Cautelar) until a final decision on this matter is obtained at the last stage of the judicial process. The favourable judge’s ruling confirming title to all 32 concessions from November 3, 2021 represents the final stage of the current judicial process. However, this ruling has recently been appealed by MINEM and INGEMMET. American Lithium has no assurance that the outcome of these appeals will be in the Company’s favour.","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-lithium-validates-sulfate-potash-110000476.html","5LA1.F","LI.V","LIACF.US","","","","","","","","","","","","","AMERICAN LITHIUM","AMERICAN LITHIUM CORP","ANSTO","LITHIUM","LITHIUM CARBONATE","PERU","SOP","THE COMPANY","","","","","","","","","","","0.996","0.058","0.853","0.089"

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220623005337/en/\n\nThe pilot will support E3 Lithium’s Clearwater project, which will draw lithium from under the Leduc oil field, Imperial’s historic discovery that first launched major oil and gas development in Western Canada. E3 Lithium’s proprietary technology is designed to extract the critical mineral from the lithium-rich brine, with potential for commercial development of battery-grade products.\n\n""This exciting collaboration brings together Imperial’s long-standing commitment to research and technology to help test and scale E3’s lithium-recovery technology,"" said Jason Iwanika, director of commercial business development at Imperial. ""We continue to advance the innovation and technologies needed to support the energy transition, working in collaboration with governments and industry to progress new opportunities from existing assets and sector expertise.""\n\n""E3 Lithium and Imperial share an interest in the diversification of the Alberta economy, local job creation and sustainability,"" said Chris Doornbos, CEO of E3 Lithium. ""Leduc No.1, Imperial’s first well into this reservoir, was one of Imperial’s most prolific oil discoveries in Alberta and transformed the provincial and Canadian economies, much like lithium has the potential to do. Having Imperial now working with E3 Lithium in exploring the redevelopment of Leduc into a world-class source of lithium is an exciting new chapter in Alberta and Canada’s story.""\n\nStory continues\n\nThe pilot project includes drilling Alberta’s first lithium evaluation wells, planned to be completed by the end of the third quarter of this year. Work will also focus on scaling up E3 Lithium’s proprietary technology, which brings the brine liquid to the surface where the lithium is removed and concentrated. This liquid is immediately returned underground as part of a closed-loop system. E3 Lithium’s PEA1 estimates the first phase of development could produce approximately 20,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per year.\n\nUnder the agreement, E3 Lithium will continue to operate the Clearwater project and retain its IP, with technical and development support from Imperial in areas such as water and reservoir management. The agreement also includes access for E3 Lithium to freehold lands in the area, which are operated by Imperial.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Imperial has agreed to invest CAD $6.35 million into E3 at a pre-paid price of CAD $1.86/warrant and the issuance of 3,413,979 warrants. Each warrant provides the holder the option to exercise the warrant for one common share of E3. The warrants are immediately exercisable, non-transferrable, expire in 24 months and are non-refundable.\n\nAbout E3 Lithium\n\nE3 Lithium is a lithium development company with 7.0 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) inferred mineral resources1 in Alberta and an NPV8% on its Clearwater Lithium Project of USD 1.1 Billion with a 32% IRR pre-tax and USD 820 Million with a 27% IRR after-tax1.

"2022-06-15T12:30:00+00:00","Clear Sky Lithium CEO Message","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, June  15, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clear Sky Lithium Corp. (CSE: POWR) (“Clear Sky” or the “Company”), a mineral exploration and development company focused on American lithium deposits to support domestic demand, is pleased to provide the following message from the Company CEO and Director, Mr. Craig Engelsman.\n\nDear stakeholders, friends, and associates,\n\nWe are pleased today to provide an update, along with key industry news and exciting details regarding our ongoing strategic plans and upcoming activities. We are grateful to everyone involved who has helped us get to where we are today, including our financial partners, supporters, geologists, and related experts who have been instrumental in guiding us forward.\n\nPublic Market Listing\r\nWe are delighted to provide today’s update and insights into the current and future activities of our growing venture. The Clear Sky team is immensely pleased to advise that, as of June 13, 2022, our common shares commenced trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) under the trading symbol “POWR.”\n\nDomestic Economic Conditions \r\nAs the world continues to emerge from a pandemic-driven transformation into a period of heightened conflict, global supply chain anxiety, and changing environmental concerns, we believe the need and argument for secure domestic production of lithium is increasing. The impetus across the national lithium sector appears to be moving to a return to American exploration and development with the support of governments at all levels in search of jobs, financing, and most importantly domestic production security.\n\nWith this confluence of events as a driving force and reminder that in the resource sector, timing often plays an important role in the success of many ventures, we are confident we have the right mix of personnel, and a strategic plan to capitalize on the current economic and geopolitical reality to achieve tangible and quantifiable results. We believe we are in the right business at the right time and right place.\n\nGrowing Demand for Lithium\r\nOn February 14th, it was reported that six of the seven automotive brands that ran ads during the Super Bowl were about electric vehicles (EV). While it was precedent-setting at the time, just a few days later the country of Ukraine was invaded, triggering unforeseen geo-economic events on top of an already fragile global economy. Today, we believe the world is on the verge of a transformation. Major industries are turning away from fossil fuels and moving towards a cleaner energy future, and part of this shift is being powered by the demand for lithium-ion battery technology.\n\nIndustrial Potential\r\nAs the cost of fuel rises, the automakers are responding and we believe the demand is poised to impact everything from trucking to air travel and beyond. An increase in intermittent renewable energy generation, from methods such as solar, is increasing the demand and viability for lithium battery solutions that encompass home storage to mega grid installations. The growth is transforming job opportunities and investment across the nation in a myriad of ways and breathing new life into regions and communities which have languished due to the exodus of American manufacturing to China in previous decades.\n\nStrong Lithium Prices and Increasing Demand\r\nThe value of lithium has increased 1,200 percent over the last two years and remains 65% higher year-to-date on the back of increased global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The U.S. lithium battery market is expected to reach $10.3B by 2026 with global demand poised to achieve $52.5B for the same period. According to recent media reports, the world is beginning to understand that large volumes of new lithium supply will be needed this decade to meet growing demand (~10x). The BMI reported gigafactory pipeline is now over 300 and is up 68% YoY to 6,387.6 GWh, which would require about 5.4 million tons of lithium (LCE) per year by 2030-32. In 2021, the world produced just 0.54 million tons of lithium (LCE).\n\nCurrent Production in America\r\nToday, the USA is home to only one active lithium mine. Consequently, much of the world’s lithium comes from South America, Australia, and China, with the U.S. producing less than 2% of the world’s supply of lithium. Currently, Chile holds the largest reserves and China dominates the worldwide supply chain for lithium-ion batteries. The Biden administration announced access to funding for a variety of resource sector initiatives through the Defense Production Act as well as a $5B plan for vehicle charging stations as part of ongoing infrastructure goals. These actions amongst others, are designed to spur domestic investment and growth across the resource and manufacturing sectors.\n\nOur Approach \r\nClear Sky Lithium is excited to be located in Nevada, the heart of America’s lithium discovery region. Within Nevada, there are multiple advanced stage lithium projects, including the only operating lithium mine in the USA.\n\nBuilding on this regional success, Clear Sky is energized to further investigate opportunities presented by combining the development of sedimentary deposits and innovative processing technologies. Unlike brine-based lithium projects, sedimentary or “claystone” deposits offer advantages in terms of environmental impact by utilizing non-evaporative extraction methods resulting in a reduction in water usage in arid desert conditions. With the advent of new extraction and processing technologies combined with an upsurge of interest, activity, and capital investment in regional claystone mining, Clear Sky developed its technology-focused strategic plan predicated on securing a prospective source of lithium-bearing claystone in a mining-friendly location.\n\nOur Project\r\nClear Sky Lithium’s Eli property straddles northern Nye and southern Eureka Counties and is located just 43km southwest of the regional mining support services available in the town of Eureka, Nevada. The valley floor has a total area of about 450 km² and at the project itself is located in a fault-bounded sub-valley to the west dominated by shallow hills and mound-like outcrops of mudstone and claystone, cut by dry gravel washes across a broad alluvial fan. The Li-bearing rocks within the project area are believed to have a strong volcanic history referred to in digital geologic models generated by the Nevada Bureau of Mines. To-date initial field work consists of a 150-surface sample dataset covering the property at a 200m x 450m grid and upgrading infill sampling over a historic sampling area. This dataset includes 134 grab samples with results ranging from 45 to 801ppm lithium with an average grade of 292ppm1, and a historical 16 grab sample collection ranging from 388 to 970ppm lithium for an average grade of 667ppm2. While these surface claystone samples are selective in nature and don’t represent the entire property, they provided the impetus to advance the project as our candidate for entry into the lithium sector.\n\nNext Steps\r\nClear Sky lithium is optimistic regarding the future of the lithium sector and in particular the opportunity for claystone asset development. The Company aims to commence with a strategic plan to advance further exploration on the property. Additionally, we aim to engage key partnerships across relevant fields of academia, as well as industry experts, commercial research and development labs, and end-users to evaluate the highest value clean-tech extraction and processing techniques.\n\nIn Conclusion\r\nUnder the current and projected economic conditions, we believe the outlook for lithium is highly favourable and looks to stay that way for the foreseeable future. The Company aims to work smart, stay nimble and efficient, while collaborating with industry leaders, current and future stakeholders, partners, and consultants to unearth the value of its current property while continuing to seek out other projects of interest, value, and long-term potential.\n\nCompany CEO and Director, Craig Engelsman, notes, “We are extremely optimistic about the lithium industry and aware of the current and pending domestic shortage of this critical mineral and are confident in the role we can play in the future success of the sector. We are fully committed to unlocking the value of lithium for the benefit of all our stakeholders and future investors alike.”\n\nClear Sky Lithium advises the public that as part of its disclosure obligations as a public issuer, all material and regulatory filings can be found on www.sedar.com.

"2022-06-05T23:17:00+00:00","Continued strong product pricing and operational update","BRISBANE, Australia, June  06, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Allkem Limited (ASX|TSX: “AKE”, the “Company”) provides an update on product pricing and operations.\n\nLithium carbonate\n\nContinued strong market conditions positively impacted the price received for lithium carbonate from the Olaroz Lithium Facility. The June quarter FY22 average price received for lithium carbonate is expected to be approximately 14% above prior guidance at US$40,000/t FOB1 on sales of approximately 3,500 tonnes. Customers continue to value security of supply which is reflected in a fully committed order book for the remainder of the calendar year.\n\nSpodumene\n\nSimilarly strong conditions continue in the spodumene market with realised spodumene concentrate pricing in the June quarter of approximately US$5,000/t SC6% CIF. Shipped spodumene concentrate for the quarter is anticipated to be approximately 38,000 dry metric tonnes (“dmt"") at an average grade in line with customer requirements of 5.3% with a further 15,000 dmt to be shipped in early July 2022.\n\nCurrent estimated annual spodumene production for FY22 is anticipated to fall marginally short of guidance by approximately 2-4%, at between 192,000 - 196,000 dmt, due to production delays resulting from the highly competitive Western Australian resources labour market and COVID-19 related requirements due to the delayed re-opening of the Western Australian border. Strategies have been implemented to mitigate these temporary impacts on production.\n\nArgentine reference price\n\nArgentina’s Customs Agency has recently set a reference price for lithium carbonate of US$53,000/t. This reference price is used by regulatory authorities when reviewing export sales of lithium chemicals to prevent under-invoicing and improve pricing transparency. This price is not used for calculation of taxes, royalties or duties and Allkem does not expect it will have any material impact on product exports, realised prices or profitability.\n\nThis release was authorised by Mr Martin Perez de Solay, CEO and Managing Director of Allkem Limited.\n\nAllkem Limited\r\n\r\nABN 31 112 589 910 \r\n\r\nLevel 35, 71 Eagle St\r\nBrisbane, QLD 4000Investor Relations & Media Enquiries\r\n\r\nAndrew Barber \r\nM: +61 418 783 701 E: Andrew.Barber@allkem.co\r\n\r\nPhoebe Lee\r\nP: +61 7 3064 3600 E:Phoebe.Lee@allkem.coConnect\r\n\r\ninfo@allkem.co\r\n+61 7 3064 3600\r\nwww.allkem.co\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICES\n\nThis investor ASX/TSX release (Release) contains general information about the Company as at the date of this Release.

"2022-05-28T09:30:00+00:00","In the DRC, a Chinese-Australian battle for control of a massive untapped lithium lode","In the 20th century, the mining industry brought fortunes into the sleepy villages of Manono, a town in the southeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nBefore independence in 1960, the Belgian settlers exploited cassiterite, the ore of tin, helping develop quarries, dams, roads, railways and foundries.\n\nWhen the Belgians left, poor management, dilapidated equipment and the collapse of the world tin prices in the 1980s sent the town to its knees.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThose troubles worsened in the civil war that followed Laurent-Desire Kabila's ousting of Mobutu Sese Seko as president in 1997.\n\nBut the discovery of a gigantic deposit of lithium - the metal used to make rechargeable batteries in phones and electric cars - by Australian company AVZ Minerals has raised hopes for the sleepy town.\n\nPerth-headquartered AVZ said in 2018 it had discovered about 400 million tonnes of lithium ore, making the Manono site potentially the world's largest untapped lithium deposit.\n\nHowever, the hopes could be short-lived, with a legal tangle over ownership pitting China's Zijin Mining against AVZ.\n\nThe dispute is a fight over a 15 per cent stake in the Manono project currently owned by Cominiere, the DRC's state-owned mining company.\n\nIn a deal signed in 2017, AVZ held a 60 per cent equity stake in Dathcom Mining, a joint venture that owns 100 per cent of Manono, while Cominiere had 25 per cent.\n\nThe Australian firm says it increased its stake from 60 per cent to 75 per cent after buying a 15 per cent stake from Cominiere but Cominiere says in its annual financial reports that the deal did not go through, a position upheld by a DRC court in December.\n\nInstead, Cominiere sold its 15 per cent stake to Chinese firm Zijin Mining via a local subsidiary for US$33.4 million, according to documents seen by London-based short-seller Boatman Capital Research.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut AVZ said that any such transfer to a third party ""would be a material breach of the pre-emptive rights"".\n\n""Essentially, AVZ believes it has pre-emptive rights to any sale of a stake and argues it would've bought that 15 per cent stake - arguing that the sale of the stake was 'spurious' in nature,"" said Greg Miller, an analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.\n\nFor its part, Zijin says it is the legitimate owner of the 15 per cent stake and will ""protect its legitimate rights and interests"".\n\nTo that end, Zijin subsidiary Jin Cheng Mining has requested arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris, according to AVZ.\n\nBoatman said in a recent research report that AVZ's interest in the Manono lithium project could fall to 36 per cent, with AVZ agreeing to sell a 24 per cent stake to Chinese battery maker Suzhou Cath Energy Technologies, jointly owned by Pei Zhenhua and Chinese battery giant CATL, for US$240 million.\n\nBut observers say there is also a deeper dispute with AVZ and its stake.\n\nLast year, AVZ said it paid Dathomir Mining Resources Sarl US$20 million for its remaining 15 per cent stake in the project, taking its total shareholding to 75 per cent. The company, owned by long-time Chinese investor in the Congo Cong Maohuai, sued in the Congo to annul the deal and won. AVZ's subsidiary is appealing against the decision, according to Miller.\n\nAVZ says it increased its stake from 60 per cent to 75 per cent in Manono after buying a 15 per cent stake from Cominiere. Photo: AVZ Minerals alt=AVZ says it increased its stake from 60 per cent to 75 per cent in Manono after buying a 15 per cent stake from Cominiere. Photo: AVZ Minerals>\n\nCongolese mining and policy analyst Christian-Geraud Neema said the issue was ""a very complex one, typical of the environment of general corruption that characterises the Congolese mining sector"".\n\n""The motivation behind the battle between Zijin and AVZ is about who's going to control the Manono lithium project,"" Neema said.\n\nHe said the supposed fear of AVZ was that the entry of Zijin into the capital of Dathcom could lead to a takeover by the Chinese side, if Zijin were to join forces with CATL.\n\nThis alliance would make the Chinese control 39 per cent of the project, denying AVZ an absolute majority, Neema said.\n\n""What is at stake for AVZ is losing control of the project. Especially since the other partner of the join venture, Dathomir, which would hold 15 per cent of the project, could join the Chinese parties, placing AVZ in a de facto minority position,"" said Neema, who is also the francophone editor at the China-Africa Project.\n\n""This position is doubly frustrating for AVZ.""\n\nNeema said AVZ had acquired the Manono mine through a close relationship with the family of former president Joseph Kabila, who is said to be the true owner of Dathomir.\n\nWhen it decided in 2017-2018 to acquire 15 per cent of Dathomir, to increase its share in Dathcom from 60 to 75 per cent, it guaranteed itself the majority of the Manono project.\n\nHowever, when a court decided to cancel this transaction, which is one of the key points in the conflict with Zijin, AVZ was once again left with 60 per cent. But it does not consider the transaction cancelled.\n\n""So, if the acquisition of the 15 per cent from Dathomir is cancelled and the acquisition of the 15 per cent by Zijin is confirmed, AVZ will have been tricked by Dathomir,"" Neema said.\n\nDathomir, which can determine who becomes the majority on the project, has remained silent on the dispute.\n\nBut Neema also said there was also no guarantee that Zijin would be part of the project, since the DRC's Inspectorate General of Finance found its acquisition of the 15 per cent stake from Cominiere fraudulent and illegal.\n\n""In all this, let's keep in mind that AVZ has Chinese shareholders, among them, you find the Zhejiang Huayou cobalt (Huayou International Mining) which acquired the Arcadia lithium project in Zimbabwe,"" he said.\n\n""So, the question might be, is the battle between AVZ and Zijin really and a China vs Australia battle? Or it might have internal Chinese rivalry [be] in play?""\n\nNeema said controlling the lithium supply chain would be the next battleground in resources.\n\nHe said China had already won the battle for cobalt and was several steps ahead of the others at all levels of the lithium supply chain.\n\n""And we can see how Chinese companies are multiplying their acquisitions in Africa, Asia and Latin America, sometimes in partnership with Western companies,"" Neema said.\n\nThe dispute comes amid shortages in the lithium market, creating a bottleneck for the electric vehicle industry.\n\n""It comes as no surprise therefore that there is heightened interest in lithium resources,"" said Miller of Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.\n\nYun Sun, director of the Stimson Centre's China programme in Washington, said lithium was in high demand to make batteries to help reduce carbon footprints.\n\n""That is why the Chinese are competing vigorously for it. China has a pretty solid background in its operations in DRC,"" Sun said.\n\nChris Berry, president of commodities advisory firm House Mountain Partners in New York, said he expected the race for lithium assets in Africa and other parts of the world to only intensify.\n\n""Lithium demand looks set to easily outpace supply in the near term and companies like Zijin want to make sure that they have a secure supply of lithium for years to come to fortify the industrial base in China,"" Berry said.\n\nHe said Manono was a gigantic lithium deposit and ""unfortunately for all involved, the litigation here could last for a long time, delaying any actual lithium production"".\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

V.OZAU | MNNFD METALS & MINING Twitter Linkedin Instagram\n\nHeadquartered out of Vancouver, BC Queensland Gold Hills is mineral exploration and development company focused on gold discoveries in the historic mining districts of Queensland Australia. At present, the company is advancing the drill ready Big Hills Gold Project in South East Queensland, Australia. The Big Hill Gold Project covers the historic mines of Big Hill, Queenslander, Monte Cristo and Sultan & Taylor of the Talgai Goldfields. This is one of eight historical Goldfields in the broader Warwick-Texas District active in the late 19th century, which include Canal Creek, Thanes Creek, Leyburn, Palgrave, Pikedale, Lucky Valley and MacDonald Goldfields. These supported both alluvial and reef mining, with the Queenslander Mine distinguishing itself as the first lode gold mine in the state of Queensland with a total production of 4.1Koz of gold at an average grade of 50g/t with some early crushings reported up to 4000g/t. The current exploration model for the Big Hill project is a high grade, shear hosted, orogenic. This is typically associated with continental margin accretionary orogens that usually occurs in terranes dominated by turbiditic (meta- sedimentary) rocks and are commonly associated with second- and third-order faults and shear zones resulting in moderately to steeply plunging, tabular to pipe-like orebodies. Historical mining activity records show that the vein system has the ability to host significant high-grade mineralization along with complex stranded structural architectures that are capable of creating large mineralised shoots. The vein systems remain open at depth below the historical workings as well as along strike and remain untested by drilling.\n\nhttps://queenslandgoldhills.com/\n\nWinshear Gold Corp.

The company completed its acquisition of the Gaban Gold and Tinka I.O.C.G. projects in Peru from Palamina Corp. in 2019. Situated in the Puno Orogenic Gold Belt in southeastern Peru, the Gaban Gold project is roughly 750 kilometers southeast of Lima. During field campaigns between 2019 and 2021, Winshear outlined a gold anomaly that measured 2.2 by 1 kilometers. Once permits have been received, the company plans to drill the first ever holes at Gaban sometime in 2022. Winshear is also pursuing its rights to the SMP Gold Project in Tanzania where it has been active in exploring and developing the SMP Gold project since 2006. In 2017, however, the Tanzanian government changed the Mining Act where the Retention License Act, where the SMP project sat under, was abolished. This has positioned Winshear to receive C$124.8 million in damages which proceedings towards a tribunal decision will begin in the first half of 2023.\n\nhttps://winshear.com/\n\nCONTACT:\n\nStockhouse Publishing\r\nSteve Andru\r\nsteve.andru@stockhouse.com\r\nStockhouse.com\n\nStockhouse Publishing Ltd.

"2022-04-29T14:33:00+00:00","Lomiko Announces Positive Results on its Initial Metallurgical Test Programs at its La Loutre Graphite Project with Results Indicating Purity of Greater Than 99.9% C(t)","Montreal, Quebec, April  29, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lomiko Metals Inc. (TSX.V: LMR) (“Lomiko Metals” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce an update on the initial metallurgical programs conducted for the La Loutre graphite project. Lomiko has engaged three independent laboratories, Corem, ProGraphite and SGS Lakefield to support the value-added metallurgical testing of samples of the La Loutre graphite concentrate.\n\nAs part of the 2022 strategic objectives, as previously announced on March 3, 2022, Lomiko is undertaking several metallurgical studies to further define the chemical and physical properties of La Loutre graphite concentrate. These studies have several goals, including (a) determining the upgrading potential of the graphite flotation concentrate for value-added processing, (b) confirming the plant flowsheet to aid in the plant design for the Pre-Feasibility Study, and (c) evaluating the production of spherical graphite for anode battery applications. This characterization work facilitates the development of Technical Data Sheets (TDS) to initiate customer partnership discussions.\n\nThe 2021 metallurgical program produced 1.8 kg of graphite flotation concentrate (please see news release April 7, 2021 and referred to within the Company’s Preliminary Economic Analysis (“PEA”)). This concentrate was split into two samples and sent to each of Corem in Quebec and ProGraphite in Germany for characterization and purification testing. The samples supplied to Corem and ProGraphite were considered an adequate representation of the deposit for initial trials.\n\nBased on the characterization and purification tests performed by the two labs, the graphite from the La Loutre deposit is suitable for a wide range of traditional markets such as refractories, fire retardants, crucible, and friction products, or expanded graphite markets.  Further, the purification results suggest that the La Loutre graphite may be suitable for high-value anode battery applications which require ultra high purity graphite concentrate of 99.95%. The evaluation of the full processing sequence from flake graphite to battery trials is scheduled for the second half of 2022.\n\nBelinda Labatte, CEO and Director, stated: “Our team is pleased to have received excellent results from two independent specialized laboratories, on the first of many trials to examine the purity of the La Loutre graphite concentrates for industrial use, including for anode battery-grade quality. The tests on the expanded graphite have shown that all the flake sizes tested are showing excellent results for our concentrates in a wide range of industrial applications, an important step to developing the graphite market in North America. The findings from this initial program will better define the parameters for the metallurgical optimization program that will commence in the spring of 2022 to support the project development.  We are looking forward to working with Quebec institutions, local communities, and First Nations to further develop our La Loutre graphite project as we move forward with future studies of this project. As mentioned in our press release dated April 22, 2022, we are looking forward to beginning our La Loutre infill and step-out drilling program which will start as soon as the ground conditions allow in mid-May. We are working toward becoming an integral and vital part of the supply chain, including the creation of new-economy job prospects in the development of our project to be used in battery production for Quebec, Canadian, and North American solutions.”\n\nCorem upgrading process reveals high purity concentrate and low level of impurities\n\nCorem subjected the 2021 flotation concentrate to initial chemical purification trials to assess the amenability of the La Loutre graphite concentrate to chemical upgrading. Using a chemical purification method, the graphite concentrate was successfully upgraded from 98.4% C(t) to >99.9% C(t). The upgrading process employed a caustic bake using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) followed by an acid leach with hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is considered one of the standard chemical treatment processes for graphite concentrates in place today and employs a milder reagent regime compared to the hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment used in many Chinese operations currently.\n\nThe final product was subjected to a size fraction - commonly referred to as flake size - analysis and each product was submitted for an ICP (Inductively coupled plasma) scan. The results of an ICP scan reveal the total carbon analysis, ash content, and sulfur grade of the flotation concentrate feedstock, the intermediate product after caustic bake, and the final product after the leaching step. The concentration of most elements met the requirements for battery anode grade material and only iron and silica displayed slightly elevated levels. It should be noted that the purification trials were preliminary in nature and that the initial concentration target of 99.5% was exceeded for each size fraction.\n\nProGraphite concentrate reveals favourable results and excellent crystallographic properties\n\nThe second sample sent to ProGraphite was classified into various fractions (+50, +80, +100, +150, +200, -200, -100 mesh). Graphite from these fractions was used to perform several chemical and physical characterization tests and purification trials. The results were generally very favourable and some of the key physical and chemical properties are outlined below, and detailed results are provided on the Lomiko website at www.lomiko.com:\n\nWell-balanced size distribution (50% >100 mesh, 50% -100 mesh). The -100-mesh size fraction is the typical feed material for anode material for lithium-ion batteries. This is consistent with the results provided in the Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) analysis, also available on the Company’s website at www.lomiko.com and published on September 10, 2021.Degree of graphitization of over 98%, which is very close to the ideal graphite and a key requirement for high-end battery applications.High tap densities of >0.7 kg/l for large fractions but below average tap density of 0.47 kg/l for -200 mesh size fraction. Optimization strategies have been identified to improve tap densities of fines. The results for the electrical conductivity are within the normal range for their respective fractions. The electric conductivity determines the amenability of graphite for energy storage applications.Achieves low levels of volatiles across all size fractions (0.13-0.38%) showing its suitability for high-temperature applications such as refractories. Achieves low springback in all size fractions (1.6 – 3.1%), which is critical for all applications where pressure forms, such as with friction products or refractories. The oxidation resistance of the larger flakes was excellent (<10% for +80 mesh), while the smaller flakes produced average oxidation behaviour compared to other graphite sources (up to 40% for -200 mesh). Oxidation resistance is an important factor for high-temperature applications. Low specific surface area (BET) for all size fractions. Achieving a low BET value is an important factor for battery anode material application. Expansion tests identified expansion rates of 350 ml/g for the +80 mesh size fraction and 390 ml/g for the +50 mesh size fraction, which were significantly better than standard values.\n\nThese characteristics support the wide use of the La Loutre graphite in both expanded markets and the potential for further purification into battery anode material.\n\nProGraphite evaluated alkaline and acid purification methods, the two most common methods in use today. The trials using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) treatment followed by sulphuric acid (H2SO4) leach produced superior purities with ash contents of only 0.04% and 0.11% in the+80 mesh and -100 mesh size fractions, respectively.  Concentrations of deleterious elements were below typical threshold values for battery anode material.\n\nThe purification tests performed by ProGraphite complement the results obtained by Corem and indicate that the La Loutre graphite can be upgraded to battery anode purity levels without aggressive leach using hydrofluoric acid (HF).\n\nUpdate on Metallurgical Process Optimization at SGS Lakefield\n\nApproximately 1,000kg of core sample from the La Loutre graphite project was carefully selected to represent mine plan, domain and grade composites and shipped to SGS in Lakefield, Ontario to confirm and optimize the test results achieved in the 2021 metallurgical testing program. This will further define the process flowsheet to aid in the plant design, which will be developed during the Pre-Feasibility Study.\n\nNext steps in La Loutre metallurgical studies\n\nCorem and ProGraphite have identified opportunities for optimization, and these will be evaluated in the upcoming months. Results from the SGS lab testing are expected to be available in the Fall and the Company will continue to move forward with and update the market on further testing for battery grade material in 2022.\n\nAbout Lomiko Metals Inc.\n\nLomiko Metals has a new vision and a new strategy in new energy. Lomiko represents a company with purpose: a people-first company where we can manifest a world of abundant renewable energy with Canadian and Quebec critical minerals for a solution in North America.

Consequently, buying materials stocks is a good way to hedge against inflation.\n\n7 Dividend Stocks Paying Over 5% to Buy Now\n\nWith that in mind, let’s dive in and take a closer look at these three materials stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCOPX Global X Copper Miners ETF $40.25 LAC Lithium Americas $25.42 CLF Cleveland Cliffs $27.87\n\nMaterials Stocks to Buy: Global X Copper Miners ETF (COPX) Piece of copper set against black background\n\nSource: Coldmoon Photoproject/Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a result of the bipartisan infrastructure law, the U.S. government will spend a great deal of money on “electrification for infrastructure, buildings, and fleets of government vehicles.” This, along with Washington looking to electrify its busses, means there will be a higher need for EV chargers. And since copper is the primary means of conducting electricity, the demand for the metal is likely to jump once the federal government starts getting large amounts of money appropriated by the infrastructure law out the door later this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat, of course, is good news for copper miners. However, it is a good, low-risk way to play that trend is through the Global X Copper Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:COPX).\n\nOverall, copper is used extensively in renewable energy. And as Europe accelerates its transition to renewable energy, China also quickly adds new solar and wind projects and many other countries rapidly embrace this energy revolution, copper prices should climb.\n\nIn recent days, amid worries about China’s new novel coronavirus lockdowns and the Federal Reserves’ interest rate hikes, COPX stock has fallen sharply. However, the decline has just created a good buying opportunity for investors looking for the top materials stocks.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) a lithium mine\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTo meet its aspirations in the energy sector, the U.S. needs to raise its supply of lithium tremendously. And to accomplish the latter goal, President Joe Biden’s administration will have to enable American companies to open lithium mines relatively quickly, despite opposition to the mines from some Native Americans and environmental activists.\n\nRight now, lithium-ion batteries are currently being used to power most electric vehicles. Moreover, such batteries are also increasingly being utilized to store electricity.\n\n7 Oversold Stocks to Scoop Up in May 2022\n\nIn turn, this bodes well for Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC), which is seeking to launch a large lithium mine in Nevada. According to its CEO, construction on the site could begin in late 2022. Given the high priority the Biden administration places on putting more EVs on America’s roads, the company will likely be able to meet that timetable. And with the demand for lithium exploding, the company will probably be extremely profitable two or three years down the road.\n\nMaterials Stocks to Buy: Cleveland Cliffs (CLF) the Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF stock) logo displayed on a web browser and magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn a previous column, I cited contract renewals and strong demand from the automotive sector amidst the EV revolution as two reasons to be bullish on CLF stock.\n\nIn conjunction with its first-quarter results unveiled on April 22, the company stated that it is indeed greatly benefiting from those two trends. More specifically, Cleveland Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) CEO Celso Goncalves reported that the company had signed hefty ” fixed contract price increases that went into effect at the beginning of this calendar year 2022.”\n\nFurthermore, on the automotive front, the steelmaker generated ” a 200,000 ton improvement [versus the previous quarter) in direct volumes to the automotive industry.” In fact, Goncalves noted that Q1 was Cleveland Cliffs’ “best shipment quarter to [the auto sector] since the semiconductor shortage began in the first quarter of last year.”\n\nOverall, Cleveland Cliffs Q1 EBITDA, excluding certain items, soared 300% year-over-year to $1.5 billion, while its adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months that ended in March 2022 came in at $6.2 billion. The latter metric was “s a record for any 12-month period in our company’s history,” Goncalves stated.\n\nThe steelmaker will continue benefiting from the high prices that it obtained in its new contracts and from the EV revolution. Meanwhile, CLF stock is trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of just 4.7.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

With the explosive production and sales of new energy vehicle globally and the electricity increase per car, the global cobalt use in new energy vehicles will continue a bullish trend with an expected CAGR at least 30% by 2025.\n\nBenefiting from new trends like remote work and online education, the cobalt use in 3C consumer electronics is expected to grow stably or slightly. Besides, the cobalt used by cemented carbides and high-temperature alloys is projected to keep a CAGR of 3% to 4% driven by the high-end manufacturing.\r\n\r\nBatteries are the largest consumer of cobalt with a share of about 57%, followed by nickel-based alloys with 14%\r\n\r\nOn a regional basis, China is the largest and fastest-growing cobalt consumer, sweeping approximately 32% of global consumption in 2020 when the second-ranked Europe seized about 23% and the No.3 United States 18%.\r\n\r\nThe global cobalt resource reserves are roughly 7.1 million tons, as is revealed by the data from USGS. Congo-Kinshasa boasts the most abundant resources, with 3.6 million tons of cobalt reserves (nearly a half of the world's total); the follower Australia has 1.4 million tons of cobalt resources as a percentage of about 20%; China holds about 80,000 tons of cobalt resources, sharing only 1.12% of the world's total, and has to rely heavily on imports to meet its own demand annually.\r\n\r\nConcerning output, the global cobalt metal output fell 6% year-on-year to about 145,000 tons in 2020, mainly because Mutanda, the world's largest cobalt mine, was closed at the end of 2019. By country, Congo-Kinshasa took a lion's share 66% of the global total with the output about 96,000 tons, while other countries had small shares like Australia 5%, Russia 4%, the Philippines 4%, Cuba 3%, Canada 3%, etc.\r\n\r\nNotably, Glencore became the world's largest cobalt ore manufacturer in 2020 by 31,800 tons as a percentage of 23.7% of the world's total, followed by China Molybdenum Co., Ltd. (""CMOC"") (which acquired cobalt ore resources from Freeport-McMoRan in 2017) 11.2% and Vale 3.3%.\r\n\r\nGlencore, headquartered in Baar, Switzerland, is the world's largest commodity trader, dedicates itself to the production and marketing of metals & minerals, energy products and agricultural products. Its metals & minerals mainly include copper, zinc, cobalt, lead, nickel, ferrochrome, gold, silver, etc., among which zinc, cobalt and copper are the fields where Glencore remains superior. Glencore owns the Mutanda Mine and Katanga Mining as its core cobalt assets.\n\nThe Mutanda Mine is an open-pit copper mine in the Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Katanga Mining operates a major mine complex in the Congo's Katanga Province, producing refined copper and cobalt. The Mutanda Mine ceased production in late 2019. Katanga Mining resumed production in early 2021. Also, Glencore possesses INO (Integrated Nickel Operations) in Canada and Murrin Murrin (100%) in Australia.\r\n\r\nHeadquartered in Luoyang city, China, CMOC is devoted to the mining, smelting, deep processing, trade and scientific research of rare and noble metals such as molybdenum, tungsten and gold. In 2016, CMOC acquired an 80% stake in Tenke Fungrume Mining (TFM), a copper-cobalt mine owned by Freeport-McMoRan in the United States for US$2.65 billion.\n\nThe mine's cobalt output was about 15,000 tons in 2020. On December 31, 2020, CMOC acquired a 95% indirect interest in the Kisanfu copper-cobalt mine in Congo-Kinshasa from Freeport-McMoRan for US$550 million; the Congo-Kinshasa government holds the rest 5% in the mine.\n\nIn April 2021, CMOC signed a 'Strategic Cooperation Agreement' with Brunp Times, an indirect holding company of CATL, allowing Brunp Times to acquire a 25% stake in KFM at a total consideration of US$137.5 million through its wholly-owned subsidiary Hongkong Brunp and CATL Co., Limited. As yet, the mine has not been put into production. According to the latest estimates, the average grade of cobalt in the mine is about 0.85%, and the amount of cobalt-containing metals hits about 3.1 million tons.\r\n\r\nGlobal and China Cobalt Industry Report, 2021-2026 highlights the following:\n\nThe cobalt industry (definition, classifications, development trends, industry policies, etc.)Global cobalt industry (reserves, output, demand, and competitive landscape, etc.)China's cobalt industry (output, demand, import and export, competitive landscape, etc.)Output, sales volume, import and export, etc. of global and Chinese cobalt segmentsThe cobalt application market, covering lithium batteries, high temperature metals, hard metals, magnetic materials, etc.18 cobalt-related manufacturers in the world and China, including Glencore, Umicore, Vale, Freeport, CMOC, Huayou Cobalt, GEM, Jinchuan, etc. (profiles, financials, output, sales volume, hit products, production base distribution and the latest dynamics)\n\nKey Topics Covered:\r\n\r\n1.

"2022-04-22T18:12:59+00:00","A top lithium expert agrees with Elon Musk that there’s not enough of the crucial metal to meet booming demand","Lithium is the metal that makes electric vehicles tick. But amid a record-high demand for the material, can supply keep up?\n\nFor over a year, a semiconductor shortage has battered the auto industry, creating supply strains and sending prices for both chips and cars soaring. Now carmakers are preparing for another bottleneck: lithium, a key element in electric car batteries.\n\nElectric car sales are at an all-time high, with companies including Tesla, Volkswagen, and Mercedes posting record shipments in the first three months of 2022. But because of the surge in demand, experts are unsure whether enough lithium is available.\n\n“In the next two years, even though there will be significant growth in supply, it will be less than demand, so the gap will just continue to grow,” lithium and mining expert Joe Lowry, who has earned the nickname Mr. Lithium, recently said in an interview with Bloomberg.\n\nLithium prices have surged a staggering 438% above last year. The increase comes as the amount of the metal used has almost quadrupled over the last decade. But the process for extracting lithium, and a relative lack of investment, have yet to catch up with the rising demand.\n\nExtracting lithium is complicated, involving either mining the ore and then separating the metal or pumping underground water deposits to the surface and then extracting the metal from pools.\n\n“You can build a battery factory in two years, but it takes up to a decade to bring on a lithium project,” Lowry said.\n\nThe U.S. plans to ramp up domestic lithium production, but currently produces less than 2% of the world’s supply. Most lithium mines and reserves are located in South America and Australia, with China largely in control of global supply chains.\n\nThe lithium supply crunch has not gone unnoticed by electric car manufacturers. Earlier this month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted about the issue, commenting on what he described as the “insane levels” of lithium prices.\n\n“​​There is no shortage of the element itself, as lithium is almost everywhere on Earth, but pace of extraction/refinement is slow,” Musk wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nMusk again raised his concerns during an earnings call with investors this week, calling for more investment into lithium mining to help close the supply gap.\n\nIn response to the high lithium prices and supply strain, Tesla announced in March that it would raise its vehicle prices. In China, one of the fastest-growing markets for EVs, companies also raised prices last month as costs for raw materials soared.\n\nWhile the lithium supply crunch may be the most pressing concern for the electric vehicle makers, other rare Earth metals essential to EV manufacturing have also been in short supply this year.\n\nNickel, a critical component of most lithium-ion batteries, has seen a huge price surge in the first few months of 2022. The Russian invasion of Ukraine destabilized nickel’s global supply, as Russia was one of the top producers of the metal in 2021.\n\nPrices for other important materials used in EV manufacturing, such as palladium, are also rising as the war in Ukraine and disruptions in global distribution networks have created a strained supply.\n\nThe supply deficit of these crucial metals may cause more electric companies to raise prices this year, potentially undermining what has so far been a blockbuster year in sales.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-lithium-expert-agrees-elon-181259766.html","TL0.F","TL0.XETRA","TSLA.MX","TSLA.US","TSLA34.SA","","","","","","","","","","","ELON MUSK","GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS","LITHIUM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","-0.87","0.068","0.889","0.044"

Musk signaled the electric car giant might finally start mining lithium due to skyrocketing prices. He first mentioned that plan almost two years ago.\n\nThe urgency to have a lineup of supply of the silvery white commodity comes as demand growth is set to surge in the coming years. While major producers such as Albemarle Corp. are expanding capacity and new projects are being built, supply growth is not fast enough due to a lack of investment following the boom-bust cycle in lithium from 2017 to 2019.\n\nFor now, lithium production concentrates in a few countries, with Chile and Australia accounting for 81% of global output. Few suppliers mean higher risk of supply disruptions.\n\nInvestors shied away from lithium producers, developers and explorers in the wake of the two-year price slump. At the time, a lot of lithium capacity was being brought online, triggered by the electrification hype when Tesla and non-hybrid vehicles came on the scene five years ago.\n\nWhile junior miners and startups are developing newer and greener technology to mine lithium, none of them have achieved commercial scale, rendering auto companies such as Tesla to rely solely on traditional mining countries such as Chile and Australia.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow WALL-E Predicted the Future Beijing Crackdown Derails Alibaba’s Bid for Amazon-Size Profit Alzheimer’s Trials Exclude Black Patients at ‘Astonishing’ Rate America’s Favorite Truck Is About to Test Tesla’s Dominance How Two Ex-Cops Cracked a $100 Million Maritime Mystery\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-wants-more-lithium-185249710.html","TL0.F","TL0.XETRA","TSLA.MX","TSLA.US","TSLA34.SA","","","","","","","","","","","BLOOMBERG","ELON MUSK","LITHIUM","LITHIUM PRODUCERS","SUPPLY AND DEMAND","","","","","","","","","","","","","","-0.968","0.104","0.848","0.048"

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $9.63 per share and $6.03 billion, respectively.\n\nThe auto retailer came up with better-than-expected results in the last reported quarter on the back of higher-than-expected revenues from new vehicle, used vehicle (retail and wholesale), and fleet and others segments. In fact, Lithia surpassed earnings estimates in the last four quarters, with the average being 30.6%. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nLithia Motors, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Lithia Motors, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nLithia Motors, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Lithia Motors, Inc. Quote\n\nInvestors are expecting the auto retailer to maintain its earnings beat streak and encouragingly, our model also predicts the same.\n\nTrend in Estimate Revisions\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings per share has moved 12 cents north in the past 30 days. The metric indicates a significant year-over-year jump of 63.5%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests year-over-year growth of 38.9%.\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Lithia this time around as well. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +8.80%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate for earnings per share is pegged 85 cents higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nZacks Rank: Lithia currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThings to Note\n\nCourtesy of economic recovery from the pandemic lows and preference for personal mobility, demand for vehicles has been on the rise, which is likely to have aided sales of Lithia. A spree of strategic buyouts is expected to have enhanced Lithia’s product portfolio and market share. Also, we expect Lithia’s Driveway e-commerce program to have significantly buoyed the firm’s first-quarter revenues.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven though tight inventory may have played a spoilsport to some extent, the rising average selling price for new and used cars amid supply-demand mismatch is likely to have fueled first-quarter revenues.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the used vehicle business is $2,360 million, indicating a significant increase from $1,487 million recorded in the year-ago period. The consensus mark for revenues from the new vehicle segment stands at $2,476 million, suggesting 12.9% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from Finance & Insurance is pegged at $269 million, implying a year-over-year improvement of 35.8%.\n\nHigher year-over-year projected gross margins for used vehicle retail also augur well. The consensus mark for first-quarter 2022 gross margins in the used vehicle retail segment is pegged at 13.2%, signaling an increase from 7.1% recorded in the corresponding period of 2021. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for gross margin in the used vehicle retail segment is 11.44%, implying an uptick from 10.1% recorded in the comparable year-ago period.\n\nOther Stocks With Favorable Combination\n\nHere are a few other stocks in the auto space, which, according to our model, also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat for the quarter to be reported:\n\nAllison Transmission ALSN has an Earnings ESP of +10.35% and a Zacks Rank #3. The stock is set to report first-quarter 2022 earnings on Apr 27.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Allison’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.16 per share and $642 million, respectively. Encouragingly, ALSN surpassed earnings estimates in the last four quarters, with an average of 13.4%.\n\nLKQ Corp LKQ has an Earnings ESP of +0.37% and a Zacks Rank #3. The stock is set to report first-quarter 2022 earnings on Apr 28.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for LKQ’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at 91 cents per share and $3.28 billion, respectively. Encouragingly, LKQ surpassed earnings estimates in the last four quarters, with an average of 33.9%.\n\nCummins, Inc. CMI has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3. The stock is set to report first-quarter 2022 earnings on May 3.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cummins’ to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $3.55 per share and $6.02 billion, respectively.

"2022-04-13T10:45:00+00:00","Comstock Acquires Industrial Battery Storage Property","Comstock Mining Inc.\n\nVIRGINIA CITY, Nev., April 13, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Comstock Mining Inc. (NYSE: LODE) (“Comstock” and the “Company”) today announced it has a definitive agreement to acquire the Haywood quarry and industrial property (the “Haywood” or “Property) from Decommissioning Services LLC for a total of $2.1 million in cash and stock. The Haywood property represents approximately 190 industrial acres in Lyon County, Nevada, and is part of one of the largest industrial parks in Lyon County. The Property has power, water and immediate highway access.\n\nThe Company plans to immediately employ a portion of the property for used lithium-ion battery (“LIB”) storage, to support the battery metal recycling operations of LINICO Corporation (“LiNiCo”), one of Comstock’s renewable energy subsidiaries. The property will receive, sort, and store waste LIBs and has immediate and easy access to US 50 which simplifies as-needed transportation to LiNiCo’s battery metal crushing, separating and processing facility located in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, right off US 50, in Storey County, NV.\n\n“This site is a key acquisition, supporting Comstock’s transformation into a renewable energy company,” stated Mr. Corrado De Gasperis, Comstock’s Executive Chairman and CEO. “It requires minimal site preparation and permitting to become a critical link in the system necessary for LiNiCo to operate at maximum throughput.”\n\nThe property originally (and currently) hosted both gold and aggregate mineral resources and mining operations. The property is strategically located and contiguous to the Company’s mineral properties in Lyon County.\n\nConventional recycling processes suffer from high lithium losses. Once the pilot crushing and separating system is operating later this year, the Company plans on extracting lithium immediately after crushing and conditioning for market leading yields that maximize lithium recovery for reuse in these electrification products.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecuring this large industrial storage site complements the Nevada-based platform for a fully integrated series of operations where the Company is currently permitting and building both pilot and commercial scale facilities for lithium-ion batteries recycling and is preparing to commence operations later this year. LiNiCo’s near term plans include efficiently crushing and separating LIBs and producing pure black mass, rich in critical battery metals including lithium, nickel, cobalt, and graphite, and then extracting substantially all of the lithium first.\n\n“LiNiCo’s ‘black mass’ powders are projecting highly concentrated materials with exceptionally high purities, giving us unprecedented optionality to work with multiple refining partners to maximize recovery of cobalt, nickel, copper, and other battery metals,” continued Mr. De Gasperis, “our lithium extraction developments will activate our ‘lithium first’ strategy that enables profitability at relative low volumes of operation and real growth.”\n\nAbout Comstock \r\nComstock (NYSE: LODE) innovates technologies that enable systemic decarbonization and circularity by efficiently converting under-utilized waste and renewable natural resources into fuels and electrification products that contribute to balancing global uses and emissions of carbon. Comstock plans to achieve extraordinary financial, natural, and social gains by building, owning, and operating a fleet of advanced carbon neutral extraction and refining facilities, commercializing complimentary process solutions and related services, and licensing selected technologies to strategic partners.\n\nTo learn more, please visit www.comstock.inc.\n\nForward-Looking Statements \r\nThis press release and any related calls or discussions may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

"2022-04-11T18:11:02+00:00","Ford inks Argentina lithium supply deal with Lake Resources","By Ernest Scheyder\n\n(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Monday it has signed a preliminary deal to buy lithium from a Lake Resources NL facility in Argentina, marking the first time the automaker has publicly announced where it will procure the electric vehicle battery metal.\n\nThe deal is a major bet by Ford on direct lithium extraction (DLE), a relatively new breed of technologies that filter the metal from brines and use far less acreage than open-pit mines and evaporation ponds.\n\nGeneral Motors Co, BMW, Stellantis NV and other Ford rivals have inked supply deals of their own with companies planning to use DLE technology.\n\nFord aims to buy 25,000 tonnes annually of the white metal from Lake's Kachi project in northern Argentina, which is being developed with privately held extraction startup Lilac Solutions Inc.\n\nLilac's technology, like all DLE technologies, has yet to work commercially, though it has the support of Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures and other high-profile investors.\n\nThe agreement between Lake and Ford is nonbinding and would need to be finalized to include a specific delivery timetable.\n\nFord Chief Executive Jim Farley said in February that his company was working on deals to secure supply of key raw materials for batteries such as lithium, nickel, rare earths and copper.\n\n""This is one of several agreements we're exploring to help Ford secure raw materials to support our aggressive EV acceleration plan,"" said Ford spokesperson Jennifer Flake.\n\nSydney-based Lake Resources is listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, which requires supply deals to be publicly disclosed.\n\nThe Kachi project, in northern Argentina near the Chilean border, is expected to cost about $540 million and open by 2024.\n\nLilac's technology uses 10 tonnes of water for every tonne of lithium produced. Lilac has said it could use a desalination plant to filter brackish water to avoid using potable water.\n\n(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder in Houston; additional reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit; Editing by Aurora Ellis)","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-inks-argentina-lithium-supply-181102201.html","F.MX","F.US","FDMO34.SA","FMC1.F","FMC1.XETRA","","","","","","","","","","","ARGENTINA","DLE","FORD MOTOR CO","LAKE RESOURCES","LITHIUM","NORTHERN ARGENTINA","","","","","","","","","","","","","0.957","0.011","0.916","0.073"
