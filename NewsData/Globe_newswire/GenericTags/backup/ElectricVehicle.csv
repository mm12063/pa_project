"2022-06-27T18:58:28+00:00","UPDATE 1-Albemarle plans major U.S. lithium processing plant","(Adds details)\n\nBy Ernest Scheyder\n\nPHOENIX, Ariz., June 27 (Reuters) - Albemarle Corp plans to build a lithium processing plant in the United States that would produce as much of the electric vehicle battery metal as the entire company produces today, a bullish bet on America's all-electric future, an executive said on Monday.\n\nThe plan reflects Albemarle's emerging strategy to lead the U.S. lithium renaissance, from mine development to processing to manufacturing types of the metal used to make high-end EV batteries.\n\nEric Norris, head of Albemarle's lithium division, said the company has seen a major shift in the last nine months in the United States with an ""unprecedented"" number of EV manufacturing plants announced, a harbinger the company believes will fuel a surge in lithium demand.\n\nThe company as a result aims to build a processing plant with 100,000 tonnes of annual capacity in the U.S. Southeast somewhere within rail access of a major port, Norris said.\n\n""There isn't enough (lithium) supply yet to supply the ambitions of the U.S.,"" Norris told the Fastmarkets Lithium Supply and Battery Raw Materials conference in Phoenix, Arizona. ""This (processing plant) will be essential for our success in the future.""\n\nAlbemarle is in active discussions with automakers on buying supply from the facility, Norris said. Albemarle already supplies Tesla Inc, as well as several other major automakers.\n\nWhile Albemarle had spoken vaguely in the past about building a U.S processing plant, it used Monday's conference to announce the specific plan and said it will be key as the company aims to boost its overall lithium production capacity fivefold to 500,000 tonnes annually by 2030.\n\nThe U.S. plant would be of a similar design to a processing plant Albemarle recently opened in Kemerton, Western Australia, though it would need to cost less than Kemerton, whose costs ballooned far above its initial target of $1.2 billion, Norris said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlbemarle plans to self-fund the facility, though it could apply for U.S. Department of Energy loans, he said.\n\nThe plant would be supplied from lithium extracted from the company's Kings Mountain mine in North Carolina, which is currently mothballed but may reopen as soon as 2027.\n\nThe Kings Mountain facility would likely compete with a planned lithium mine and processing complex in a nearby North Carolina county from Piedmont Lithium Inc, which faces regulatory and local pushback.\n\nUnlike Piedmont's mine, Kings Mountain would be a reopening of a facility that closed in the 1980s, a distinction that Norris said he expects to work in Albemarle's favor.\n\n""This is an existing mine in a town that is very mining oriented,"" Norris said. ""We're very present in the community.""\n\n(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder Editing by Chris Reese and Leslie Adler)","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-albemarle-plans-major-u-185828902.html","ALB.US","AMC.F","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ALBEMARLE CORP","ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERY","ERIC NORRIS","LITHIUM","PROCESSING PLANT","","","","","","","0.908","0.003","0.957","0.04"

"2022-06-15T10:00:00+00:00","EV battery startup Alsym aims to slash cost, eliminate lithium and cobalt","By Paul Lienert\n\nJune 15 (Reuters) - Alsym Energy, a seven-year-old Massachusetts startup, aims to halve the cost of electric vehicle batteries with a new design that eliminates lithium and cobalt, two increasingly costly ingredients in many current EV batteries, the company said on Wednesday.\n\nOne of the company's goals is to help make EVs more affordable for a greater portion of the world's population, a key executive said.\n\nAlsym has partnered with one of India’s top automakers to jointly develop the new battery, Mukesh Chatter, chief executive and co-founder, said in an interview. Chatter declined to name the automaker.\n\nIndia’s two largest vehicle manufacturers are Tata Motors and Mahindra and Mahindra, both of which build electric vehicles.\n\nAlsym’s battery has the potential to be safer, more sustainable and easier to recycle because it is made with non-toxic, non-flammable materials that are readily available, said Chatter, who has a graduate degree in engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\n\nChatter said his wife and longtime business partner Priti Chatter, who holds degrees in chemistry, biology and finance, came up with the company’s larger mission.\n\n“She said, we need to identify technologies that are affordable than can have an impact on the lives of at least one billion people. That’s how it started.”\n\nAlsym’s battery, which can also be used for stationary energy storage and marine applications, uses such relatively common materials as manganese and aluminum, he said.\n\nEventually the company hopes to build its battery cells with a manufacturing partner, Chatter said, with a target production date of 2025.\n\nThe company has raised $32 million from Helios Climate Ventures and other investors.

"2022-06-07T15:10:46+00:00","Top producer Albemarle risks shutting German plant if EU declares lithium a hazard","By Clara Denina and Pratima Desai\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Top lithium producer Albemarle Corp may have to shut its Langelsheim plant in Germany if the metal used in electric vehicle batteries is declared a hazardous material by the European Union, its finance chief told Reuters.\n\nLithium's pivotal role in electric vehicles makes it an important commodity in meeting global targets to cut carbon emissions, and it was added to the EU's list of critical raw materials in 2020.\n\nHowever, the European Commission is currently assessing a proposal by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to classify lithium carbonate, chloride and hydroxide as dangerous for human health.\n\nThat would result in a more restrictive regulatory framework for their use at a time when the EU is aiming to be self-sufficient in electric vehicle batteries by 2025.\n\nThe proposal doesn't ban lithium imports, but if legislated will add to costs for processors from more stringent rules controlling processing, packaging and storage.\n\n""Albemarle would no longer be able to import our primary feedstock, lithium chloride, putting the entire (Langelsheim) facility in jeopardy of closure,"" said Chief Financial Officer Scott Tozier in an emailed statement.\n\n""With sales of approximately $500 million annually, the economic impact to Albemarle from the potential closure would be significant,"" Tozier added.\n\nA European Commission official confirmed it was assessing the proposal, but had no further comment.\n\nEU member states are currently giving their views on the proposal to a committee which meets on July 5-6 to discuss chemicals including lithium that have been recommended for classification as dangerous. A final decision is expected at the end of 2022 or beginning of 2023.\n\nThe United States and Europe have accelerated efforts over the past two years to build secure and independent supply chains to cut reliance on China for key minerals used in electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels.\n\nStory continues\n\nTozier said the classification would ""hinder the localisation of the EU battery supply chain, and instead move the process to a non-EU location, thereby creating the need to import"".\n\n""Future battery recycling and cathode manufacturing would move outside of the EU. Albemarle would not be able to convert materials locally, and any EU lithium raw materials would need to be exported to create cathodes.""\n\nHaving produced lithium since 1921, the Langelsheim plant employs more than 600 people and accounts for 8% of New-York listed Albemarle's projected 2022 net sales.\n\nThe European Commission has estimated Europe would need up to 18 times more lithium by 2030 than in 2020, and 60 times more by 2050.\n\n""Classifying lithium as hazardous would create extra burdens on how lithium chemicals for batteries are produced, used and recycled in Europe,"" an industry source said.\n\n(Reporting by Clara Denina and Pratima Desai; Additional reporting by Kate Abnett in Brussels; Editing by Jan Harvey)","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-producer-albemarle-risks-shutting-151046031.html","ALB.US","AMC.F","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ALBEMARLE CORP","ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERIES","EUROPEAN CHEMICALS AGENCY","EUROPEAN COMMISSION","EUROPEAN UNION","LANGELSHEIM","LITHIUM CARBONATE","LITHIUM CHLORIDE","SCOTT TOZIER","","","-0.396","0.051","0.899","0.05"
"2022-06-05T15:00:00+00:00","Soaring Diesel Prices Could Accelerate The Electric Vehicle Boom","As diesel prices soar the electrification of freight is becoming increasingly necessary. Innovations in electric vehicle batteries are making it more likely for trains to become electric over the next decade, even the heaviest of freight locomotives.\n\nRising fuel prices are being seen by consumers worldwide. With no end in sight, the faster rollout of more electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources is becoming increasingly discussed by governments, energy firms, and consumers themselves. The cost of diesel is rising ever higher, meaning that truck, train, and ship operators are feeling the strain. In May, the retail price of diesel reached $5.577 a gallon, an increase of 76 percent from the previous year. And the price of fuel is likely to keep on climbing.\n\nThe rise in oil and gas costs is encouraging governments and companies around the world to develop renewable alternatives at a much faster pace than previously expected. Green energy was already gaining momentum following the COP26 climate summit last year, and now companies around the globe are racing to develop competitive electric batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, and other innovative technologies to use instead of traditional fuel in the coming years.\n\nIn 2021, the world’s first partially battery-electric freight train was unveiled in Pittsburgh, showing that the electrification of heavy freight vehicles is possible. The rail freight firm Wabtec worked in partnership with Carnegie Mellon University to develop the zero-emissions technology needed to run the train. It had 500 lithium-ion battery modules stacked in the centre of the carriages to power the train.\n\nThe current train design reduces fuel consumption by 11 percent, around 6,200 gallons of diesel. And the next model, expected to be launched within two years, will reduce consumption by around a third. Eventually, Wabtec hopes to incorporate hydrogen fuel cells into the design to make the train completely emissions-free.\n\nStory continues\n\nOnly around 7 percent of the world’s goods are currently transported by freight rail, with many companies opting for diesel-guzzling trucks. In the U.S., the government hopes the $600 million establishment of a new freight rail innovation institute might help shift this preference. Greater research and development into the production of batteries that are big enough to power colossal trains could help significantly reduce costs, encouraging companies to opt for train transportation.\n\nThe development of battery-electric trains is more appealing than the alternative electrification of rail lines in countries such as the U.S. due to the high costs involved with the installation of catenaries (overhead wires). A 2012 study suggested that installation costs could be as much as $4.8 million per mile of track, making it unattractive for investors.\n\nThis year, the transportation industry is even more ambitious about its battery-electric freight train potential. Union Pacific recently announced it will invest $100 million in the purchase of 20 battery-electric trains and charging points from Wabtec and Caterpillar’s Progress Rail, marking the biggest sale to date. The plan is to use the trains to pull cars around freight yards located in both California and Nebraska, with the expectation of eliminating 8,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions a year.\n\nRelated: The Rush Is On For LNG Tankers\n\nAutomakers around the world are investing heavily to speed up the production of battery-electric cars as governments put pressure on companies to decarbonize. However, EVs require significantly smaller and lighter batteries than giant freight vehicles, such as trucks and trains. Therefore, the rollout of fully battery-electric freight trains is unlikely in the short term but may be possible in the coming decades, as several countries strive for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nSome companies are searching for alternatives to batteries for their freight transport, with many firms researching biodiesel and synthetic fuels created from renewable energy. In addition, some passenger train operators are looking to incorporate hydrogen fuel cells into the design for trains to run off green hydrogen. However, this may only be possible for lightweight trains due to the size, weight, and expense of the fuel cells required to pull heavier weights.\n\nGebhardt highlights some of the innovations being made in the electric battery field, suggesting that regenerative brakes can help power the trains’ electric batteries to make them travel further. He explains, “We’re now at 7 Mwh (batteries) and we’re going to 8 Mwh in the near future. When we do that, we’re going to save 30 percent on fuel usage.” He added, “because every time you hit the brakes all of that is charging the batteries. It’s several megawatts worth of power going into those batteries… The big difference between a train and a truck is that you may have a mile or two of cars behind you on a train, which are 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 tonnes.”\n\nWith no end in sight for the end of rising diesel costs, transport operators will be racing to develop alternative technologies to incorporate into their vehicles in the coming years. But due to the size and weight of freight transportation, this is no easy feat. Nevertheless, the launch of the first partially battery-electric freight train in 2021 and the development of a bigger fleet this year demonstrates the potential for the electrification of freight, particularly with constant innovations being made in hydrogen fuel cells, which could enhance battery-powered vehicles.\n\nBy Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nThe U.S. Desperately Needs To Revamp Its Energy Policies Biden Administration Considers A Windfall Tax On Oil And Gas Profits There’s No Immediate Cure For Sky-High Gasoline Prices\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/soaring-diesel-prices-could-accelerate-150000908.html","WAB.US","WB2.F","WB2.XETRA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ELECTRIC BATTERIES","ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERIES","ELECTRIC VEHICLES","FREIGHT LOCOMOTIVES","FREIGHT TRAIN","FREIGHT VEHICLES","HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS","RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES","WABTEC","","","0.988","0.016","0.919","0.065"

"2022-05-06T15:44:54+00:00","CME explores nickel contract after LME trade chaos -sources","By Pratima Desai\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - CME Group is talking to market participants about the idea of a cash-settled nickel contract for companies to hedge costs of the electric vehicle battery raw material, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nMarket participants say a viable alternative trading venue would give disgruntled users the opportunity to move away from the London Metal Exchange (LME) where nickel trading was thrown into chaos early in March.\n\nNickel prices on the LME doubled to a record above $100,000 a tonne within hours in March - as war in major producer Russia lit a fire under an already rallying market.\n\nThe spike was driven by expectations that Chinese stainless steel producer Tsingshan Holding Group and others would buy metal to cover substantial short positions.\n\nThe LME suspended nickel trade and cancelled deals worth billions of dollars, raising questions about its ability to run an orderly market.\n\nThe Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) has a nickel contract, but using it is difficult for non-Chinese firms as they need to be affiliated with a local entity and because it is priced in yuan.\n\nFor now, there are no feasible alternatives for hedging or trading nickel, mostly used to make stainless steel. The CME is considering launching a nickel sulphate contract, possibly by the end of this year, the sources said.\n\nNickel trading volumes on the LME have dropped since the market's suspension in March. In April the number was 819,108 lots or 4.91 million tonnes compared with more than 1.7 million lots or 10 million tonnes in February.\n\nBoth sources with knowledge of the matter said it was not possible to quantify how much volume a CME nickel contract could take from the LME's contract.\n\nNickel sulphate is a chemical used to make the cathode component of the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used to power electric vehicles.\n\n""CME have been talking to market participants, looking at the opportunity and appetite for a nickel sulphate contract,"" one source said.\n\nStory continues\n\n""A financially settled nickel sulphate contract may work, electric vehicles are the future and the auto industry needs to be able to hedge the materials used to make them.""\n\nCME declined to comment.\n\nBenchmark Mineral Intelligence estimates nickel demand for electric vehicle batteries will rise to nearly 1.7 million tonnes in 2030, or 33% of the total, from around 350,000 tonnes or 12% of the total last year.\n\nIndustry sources say a cash-settled nickel sulphate future has a better chance of success than a physically deliverable nickel metal contract, which would require producers to deliver metal to CME warehouses.\n\nThe CME's aluminium, zinc and lead contracts are physically deliverable and hampered by a lack of stock in its approved warehouses, industry sources say. The contracts are competing directly with already established LME products.\n\nVolume for CME aluminium at nearly 460,000 tonnes in April is a fraction of the 95 million tonnes traded on the LME.\n\n""The CME can't offer what the physical market needs, being able to hedge days, weeks, months and years ahead,"" a second source with knowledge of the matter said. ""Copper is the only CME base metal contract that works and that's because it's popular with speculators.""\n\nSome speculators prefer the CME's copper contract as trades are settled as soon as they are closed, while those on the LME are settled on the third Wednesday of each month.\n\n(Reporting by Pratima Desai; editing by Veronica Brown and Susan Fenton)","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cme-explores-nickel-contract-lme-154454845.html","CHME34.SA","CME.US","MX4A.F","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CME GROUP","CONTRACT","ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERY","LONDON METAL EXCHANGE","MARKET PARTICIPANTS","NICKEL METAL","NICKEL SULPHATE","","","","","0.944","0.035","0.901","0.064"

"2022-04-28T03:04:03+00:00","Top Bid for Lithium Up 140% After Musk’s ‘Insane Levels’ Call","(Bloomberg) -- The highest bid for lithium at an online sale surged by 140% in just six months, an indication the stampede for supplies of the main ingredient used in electric vehicle batteries could get even more intense.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFour European Gas Buyers Made Ruble Payments to Russia Amazon’s Twitch Seeks to Revamp Creator Pay With Focus on Profit Russia to Cut Gas to Poland and Bulgaria, Making Energy a Weapon Russia to Cut Gas to Poland, Bulgaria Until Pay Demands Met A Powerful Dynasty Bankrupted Sri Lanka in Just 30 Months\n\nPilbara Minerals Ltd.’s auction of spodumene concentrate -- a partly-processed form of lithium -- attracted a top bid of $5,650 a ton on Wednesday for a cargo of 5,000 tons. That compares with $2,350 at the previous sale in late October on the Australian miner’s Battery Metal Exchange.\n\nThe surging prices are unnerving battery makers and EV firms. Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said this month that lithium had gone to “insane levels” and is the “fundamental limiting factor” for EV adoption, adding the car giant might consider mining or refining it directly. Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the world’s largest battery maker, said last week it had won exploration rights for a lithium clay deposit in China.\n\n“The pricing received on the BMX sales trading platform is indicative of the critical shortage that exists in respect of lithium raw material supply,” Pilbara Minerals said in a statement. It’s the company’s fourth online spodumene sale.\n\nThe jump in the auction bid is roughly in line with the increase in lithium carbonate -- a chemical used in battery production -- in China. It started rising in the middle of last year as the global recovery from the pandemic coincided with a surge in EV demand.\n\nThe rally has lost momentum in recent weeks -- prices are currently at 467,500 yuan ($71,182) a ton, according to Asian Metal Inc. -- as the worsening virus outbreaks upended supply chains and clouded the consumption outlook. The auction result suggests Chinese lithium compound prices are unlikely to drop below 400,000 yuan a ton, Daiwa Capital Markets’ analysts Dennis Ip and Leo Ho said in a note.\n\nStory continues\n\nMiners are cranking up production to meet the skyrocketing demand and also enjoying bumper profits. Chinese producer Ganfeng Lithium Co. reported a more than 600% jump in first-quarter net income from a year earlier, while Pilbara’s share price rose as much as 6.5% on Wednesday.\n\nThe Perth-based miner said it plans to hold the auctions more frequently as it ramps up production at its Ngungaju mine in Western Australia. However, it also warned that virus-related labor disruptions may result in output being in the lower half of the 340,000-380,000 ton guidance for the year through June.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAn Entire Neighborhood Is Being Flipped by a Los Angeles Developer The 400 Airplanes That Russia Seized Have Become an Epic Insurance Struggle China’s Biggest Covid Failure Is Not Deploying an mRNA Vaccine China’s Campaign to Wipe Out Covid Is Crushing Its Economy Elon Musk Stakes a $44 Billion Claim on the Future of Free Speech\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-bid-lithium-140-musk-030403553.html","PILBF.US","PLR.F","PLS.AU","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BATTERY METAL EXCHANGE","BLOOMBERG","CONTEMPORARY AMPEREX TECHNOLOGY CO.

"2022-04-27T11:01:39+00:00","Can You Invest in Nickel? 7 Stocks to Consider.","Can you invest in nickel? Yes you can! Here are seven companies with significant nickel mining operations. Vale S.A. (VALE): Expects a 9% annual increase in nickel production in 2022. Glencore (GLNCY): Marketed 8% of global nickel production in 2021. Sherritt International (SHERF): A near pure-play nickel stock that has more than doubled so far this year. Lundin Mining (LUNMF): Earn a 3.3% yielding dividend while participating in a nickel upside. Centaurus Metals (CTTZF): Expects to produce 20,000 metric tons of nickel per annum by 2024. Panoramic Resources (PANRF): The company’s Savannah resource estimate includes 209,800 metric tons of nickel. Canada Nickel Company (CNIKF): Could produce “NetZero” nickel and cobalt to supply North American battery makers.\n\nIt was already on a sustained up-trend for nearly three years, but nickel’s sudden price surge in 2022 has made the base metal too attractive to the retail investor community to ignore. A short squeeze triggered the historic turmoil in nickel futures trading recently as the Russia-Ukraine conflict distorts global nickel trading, but a long-term electric-vehicle linked demand surge makes nickel stocks good investments to consider right now.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) founder Elon Musk shared his concerns on nickel prices and production in 2021. Come 2022, nickel futures prices exploded. Honestly, the recent 250% price spike in nickel futures in two trading sessions on the London Metal Exchange (LME) to hit the $100,000 per metric ton mark in March is by no means a bullish indicator to invest in nickel.\n\nHowever, rising demand growth from electric vehicle battery manufacturers, global economic growth and increasing construction activity could combine to support strong nickel prices. Although the Nickel Institute claims that about 72% of global nickel production is primarily used in stainless steel manufacturing and just 7% is used in batteries, growing electric vehicle battery production could lift nickel demand significantly going forward.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore we get down to potential nickel investment plays to consider, it’s important to highlight the volatile nature of nickel trading. As a base metal, nickel prices are closely linked to global economic activity. Any economic recessions may heavily impact its demand and weaken its prices.\n\nThe biggest threat to an investment in nickel today is Indonesia’s rapid production growth. Indonesia is the largest nickel-producing country in the world. Its nickel production levels increased from just 130,000 metric tons in 2015 to an estimated 1,000,000 metric tons in 2021. Any excess supplies of the base metal could weaken its average prices and trigger a plunge in nickel stocks.\n\nThat said, investors bullish on nickel price growth can participate in its upside in several ways.\n\nThey can invest directly in the metal through the futures market or trade options on nickel futures contracts. Another less common alternative could involve buying physical nickel bars, taking delivery and suffering persistent storage and security costs throughout the holding period. The easiest way to invest in nickel is through buying stocks of nickel mining companies, processors and key players in the nickel value chain.\n\n7 Consumer Stocks to Buy as the Weather Warms Up\n\nBelow is an assortment of seven nickel stocks investors could consider. They range from diversified multibillion-dollar mining and commodity trading giants to very small development stage pure-plays that could offer better upside yet with higher equity risk.\n\nVALE Vale S.A $15.76 GLNCY Glencore $11.69 SHERF Sherritt International 58 cents LUNMF Lundin Mining $9.12 CTTZF Centaurus Metals $1.13 PANRF Panoramic Resources 26 cents CNIKF Canada Nickel Company $1.76\n\nVale S.A. (VALE) the Vale (VALE) logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's webpage in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nBrazil-based Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) is a diversified mining house that’s the second-largest nickel producer in the world. VALE stock price has risen 13% year-to-date as commodity prices rallied in 2022. Vale’s major revenue source is iron ore mining, but its base metals division is dominated by nickel mines and smelters, with some copper exposure on the side.\n\nAlthough pure nickel sales constituted 10% of total revenue from continuing operations in 2021, Vale is a significant player in the nickel value chain globally. The company produced 168,000 metric tons of nickel last year. Management’s production guidance for 2022 includes a potential 9% year-over-year increase in nickel production to between 175,000 and 190,000 metric tons in 2022.\n\nVale stock is a value play with a low trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 3.2. Shares could attract better valuation multiples as the company disposes of its coal business to improve its environmental, social and governance (ESG) profile this year.\n\nMost noteworthy is Vale’s investor-friendly capital return programs. These include a generous dividend policy (recent dividends yield 14% annually) and a commitment to share repurchases that bolster shareholder returns.\n\nGlencore (GLNCY) GLNCY stock: the Glencore sign outside a building\n\nSource: Marlon Trottmann / Shutterstock\n\nGlobal mining and commodities trading giant Glencore’s (OTCMKTS:GLNCY) stock price has gained 16% so far this year as commodity prices outperformed most assets in early 2022. It ranks high as a cobalt stock to buy, and Glencore stock could rise further as its significant exposure to other key EV battery materials nickel and copper gives investors a huge opportunity to capture the EV growth upside.\n\nGlencore produced 102,300 metric tons of nickel from owned sources in 2021 and its marketing division sold 202,000 metric tons of the base metal last year (about 8% of total global nickel production). Nickel’s marketing volumes surged 36% year-over-year during the past year. Management guides for about 12% annual growth in nickel production to 110,000 to 120,000 metric tons in 2022.\n\nMost noteworthy, the company is developing what it calls “next-generation nickel mines” in Canada, an investor-friendly mining jurisdiction. Commissioning could take place in 2024-25.\n\n7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Buy for Q2\n\nHigher productivity and firmer prices in 2022 and beyond make Glencore a good nickel stock to buy right now. Investors could capture a 4.3% yielding dividend while waiting to capture a promising nickel upside.\n\nSherritt International (SHERF) nickel stocks: a piece of nickel ore in front of a white background\n\nSource: aura23 / Shutterstock\n\nSherritt International’s (OTCMKTS:SHERF) stock price has rallied by 77% so far this year as nickel and cobalt prices shot through the roof. Investors can invest in nickel by buying Sherritt stock.\n\nThrough a joint venture with a Cuban nickel company, Sherritt mines for nickel in Cuba and runs high-purity nickel and cobalt refinery operations in Canada. In a recent 2022 production guidance provided in February, Sherritt expects nickel production to increase from 31,184 metric tons in 2021 to between 32,000 and 34,000 metric tons in 2022.\n\nThe company has an energy production business in Cuba that provides variable distributions and some fertilizer and related product sales.\n\nHowever, it’s the nickel and cobalt line that management seems overly focused on right now, and there are plans to grow nickel and cobalt annual production capacity by 20% and extend the mine’s life beyond 2040.\n\nLundin Mining (LUNMF) nickel stocks: several bars of nickel in rows\n\nSource: AlexLMX / Shutterstock\n\nCanadian base metals miner Lundin Mining (OTCMKTS:LUNMF) is another nickel play one could buy and hold as base metals take a price leap forward in 2022.\n\nLundin Mining primarily produces nickel, copper, zinc and gold from its mines located in Brazil, Chile, Portugal, Sweden and the United States. Its Eagle mine in Michigan produced nearly 18,400 metric tons of nickel in 2021. Nickel comprised 8% of Lundin Mining’s total annual revenue in 2020 and 2021.\n\nMost concerning though is management’s current nickel production guidance for the next two years. Lundin Mining guides nickel production for 2022 to decline to 15,000 to 18,000 tons, 13,000 to 16,000 metric tons in 2023 and a further decline to 9,000 to 12,000 metric tons by 2024.\n\nNow that the company is growing its copper, zinc and gold assets through an acquisition this year, nickel’s contribution to total financial performance could significantly decline over the next few years.\n\n7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy for a Robust Retirement\n\nThat said, investors in Lundin Mining stock do get diversified exposure to base metals upside and a 3.6% yielding dividend.\n\nCentaurus Metals (CTTZF) Nickel ore representing TLOFF stock.\n\nSource: TheLearningPhotographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nAustralia-based Centaurus Metals (OTCMKTS:CTTZF) markets its stock to investors as “a rare opportunity to invest in a rapidly unfolding high-grade nickel sulphide growth story.”\n\nThe small mining company recently acquired the Jaguar nickel project in Brazil’s Carajás mining province from mining giant Vale in 2020. Centaurus expects to produce more than 20,000 metric tons of nickel per annum by the end of 2024. The company’s other Brazil-located pre-revenue producing asset is the iron-ore-focused Jambreiro resource.\n\nCentaurus Metals stock is a speculative play on nickel upside investors could consider. U.S.-based investors buying the nickel play on the over the counter market may want to utilize stop buy and stop sell orders to minimize trading risks due to thin trades on CTTZF stock.\n\nBetter liquidity may be available on the company’s local stock exchange.\n\nPanoramic Resources (PANRF) An image of the nickel entry from the periodic table of the elements.\n\nSource: TonelloPhotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPanoramic Resources (OTCMKTS:PANRF) is another Australia-based speculative nickel stock that could offer investors exposure to both nickel and cobalt upside. The company restarted its nickel, copper and cobalt production project in Western Australia recently and has since made its third nickel-copper-cobalt concentrate shipment to China this month.\n\nThe latest ore shipment to China, valued at nearly $22 million, is the company’s largest invoice since resuming production. Two additional shipments are scheduled for this quarter.\n\nNew offtake agreements with commodities trading giant Trafigura guaranteed a strong financial partner and provided a reliable customer for the miner’s production.\n\nNickel is Panoramic Resources’ major resource. The company’s Savannah resource estimate includes 209,800 metric tons of nickel, 13,700 metal metric tons of cobalt and 94,200 metric tons of copper, but ongoing exploration activity could uncover more proven and probable reserves that could lift PANRF stock going forward.\n\n7 Cheap Stocks to Buy Before the Next Breakout\n\nSoaring nickel and cobalt prices helped shine the spotlight on Panoramic Resources stock, which has gained 107% in value over the past twelve months and 27% year-to-date. However, investment risks are high on the volatile penny stock. Shares have posted a 5% decline in the trailing month.\n\nCanada Nickel Company (CNIKF) The logo for Canada Nickel Company (CNIKF) and info about the company is displayed on a screen.\n\nSource: T.

The company is advancing an ambitious “NetZero” battery-grade nickel and cobalt production project in Canada.\n\nThe company’s development-stage Crawford Nickel-Cobalt Sulphide Project targets producing nickel, iron and cobalt in an environmentally friendly way. Canada Nickel Company’s stock could thus score high on an ESG scale and attract strong and lasting industry partnerships with environmentally conscious peers as the company seeks to support a growing EV battery manufacturing industry in North America.\n\nA recent equity raise boosts its balance sheet and cash position to fund project development. Canada Nickel Company stock investors could enjoy more capital gains when full-scale production kicks off and execution risks fall away. Until then, the company remains a speculative nickel and battery material pure-play. Over the counter trades on CNIF stock are thin, investors may find better liquidity in Canadian-traded shares of the nickel stock.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

"2022-04-18T20:30:00+00:00","Syrah Resources gets $107 mln U.S. loan for Louisiana EV battery plant","By Ernest Scheyder\n\nApril 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy is lending $107 million to graphite miner Syrah Resources Ltd to build an electric vehicle battery parts facility in Louisiana, the first loan in more than 10 years from the department's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) funding program.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has set aggressive targets for half of all vehicles sold in the United States to be electric-powered by 2030, a goal that will require more domestic processing of EV building blocks. While the ATVM program has lent to automakers Ford Motor Co and Tesla Inc in the past, the Syrah loan is the first not directly to an automaker.\n\n""The U.S. is serious about onshoring the battery manufacturing and critical materials supply chains,"" Jigar Shah, head of the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office, told Reuters. He estimated the United States only has about 5% of the manufacturing capacity needed to hit Biden's 2030 target.\n\nLithium Americas Corp, ioneer Ltd, Lordstown Motors Corp and Piedmont Lithium Inc have said they also have applied for ATVM loans.\n\nAustralia-based Syrah plans to use the loan to help fund the expansion of a Louisiana facility that will process graphite mined from Mozambique into anodes, the positively charged electrode of a battery. The facility is expected to produce enough anodes to build 2.3 million EVs by 2040.\n\nSyrah, which has a deal to supply anodes to Tesla starting in 2024, completed a stock offering in February to help further fund the $176 million project.\n\nImportantly for Shah's office, Syrah said its mine follows sustainable mining practices and most of the mine's employees are Mozambican, with independent auditors verifying the claims. The Louisiana facility is expected to create about 150 construction jobs and 98 full-time jobs.\n\n""The loan will allow Syrah to ... support the rapidly growing EV and battery supply chain in the USA,"" said Shaun Verner, Syrah's managing director.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy Congressional mandate the ATVM program is not allowed to fund construction of new mines, but it can fund processing facilities. Shah's office is review $2 billion in other loan applications.\n\nShah said Syrah's loan was processed in about five months because the company was quick to respond to information requests, though he said other loan applications will take longer.\n\n""The vast majority of applicants aren't ready,"" Shah said. ""We need all of our questions answered to be able to process a loan.""\n\n(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; editing by Barbara Lewis)","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/syrah-resources-gets-107-mln-203000691.html","3S7.F","SRHYY.US","SYAAF.US","SYR.AU","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY VEHICLES MANUFACTURING","BATTERY MANUFACTURING","DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY","ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERY","JIGAR SHAH","LOAN APPLICATIONS","LOUISIANA","PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN","SYRAH","TESLA INC","","0.881","0.017","0.93","0.053"

"2022-04-14T10:59:27+00:00","Panasonic To Introduce Bigger EV Battery To Diversify Business From Tesla: FT","In an effort to diversify its business from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Panasonic Holdings (OTC: PCRFY) will roll out a bigger electric vehicle battery as the Company works to focus direction after a period of aggressive streamlining. Yuki Kusumi, Panasonic's CEO, said that the Company would invest ¥600 billion ($4.8 billion) over the next three years, with two-thirds earmarked for EV batteries, supply chain software, and air conditioners, reports Financial Times. The Company plans to introduce two production lines for the battery, which has a fivefold energy capacity compared with the current ones. Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has said the 4680, which is not scheduled for mass production until next year, will help bring down the price of a Tesla car to about $25,000. Tesla's Model 3 starts at about $41,000. For Panasonic, the battery represents an opportunity to diversify its client base from Tesla. ""If the 4680 is second to none in terms of performance and cost, manufacturers other than Tesla will eventually adopt it,"" said Kusumi. Kusumi's plans reflect Panasonic's desire to return to robust growth after aggressive streamlining under former president Kazuhiro Tsuga, who spent years shedding underperforming business lines, including the Company's famous plasma TVs. The remaining ¥200 billion for the next three years will be used for technology, including hydrogen energy.\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\nJPMorgan Reshuffles China Leadership To Tackle Slowing Growth: Bloomberg FDA Intends To Revoke Protagonist Therapeutics' Rusfertide Breakthrough Tag In Rare Form Of Blood Cancer\n\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Passing higher prices on to consumers is more difficult,"" said Yuki Kusumi, who oversees a company that makes products ranging from Tesla Inc's electric vehicle batteries to washing machines.\n\nPanasonic, Kusumi said at a roundtable briefing, was responding by improving manufacturing machinery to help absorb the extra expense, but those measures were not enough cover big price increases.\n\nThe global price of nickel, much of it supplied by Russia to make batteries, has soared this year, reaching more than $100,000 a tonne in March.\n\nPanasonic said in February that its third quarter operating profit slid 44% partly because of rising material costs.

"2022-03-24T23:15:50+00:00","Factbox-Swapping electric car batteries since the Gilded Age","By Paul Lienert and Nick Carey\n\n(Reuters) - Battery swapping - replacing a depleted battery with a freshly charged one - is not new: The first experiments with exchanging batteries in electric cars date to America's Gilded Age in the late 1890s, according to industrial historian David A. Kirsch.\n\nHere is a timeline of key events in the development of battery swapping:\n\n1896: Auto pioneers consider the exchange of depleted batteries with fresh ones as a way to extend the operating range of early rudimentary electric vehicles, from streetcars to delivery trucks.\n\n1912: General Electric Co teams up with local partners in Connecticut to launch a ""battery service"" that enables electric vehicle owners to swap batteries for a modest monthly fee and a variable per-mile charge. Other similar services spring up in large cities. Semi-mechanized swaps take as little as three minutes at some stations. And by separating the battery from the vehicle, the service helps lower the initial cost by a third or more.\n\n1924: General Electric's GeVeCo battery service is discontinued. Waning demand for electric vehicles and the lack of interest in industry-wide battery standardization stall further development of electric vehicle battery swapping for more than 80 years.\n\n2007: Silicon Valley startup Better Place develops a ""battery switching"" process and signs up Renault-Nissan for pilot projects in several countries.\n\n2008: The Beijing Olympics showcase a fleet of 50 electric buses featuring swappable batteries. China's Wanxiang demonstrates an electric bus with swappable batteries at the Games.\n\n2010: Better Place is invited to meet with officials of the state-owned China Grid to discuss battery swapping. China Grid ends the talks without a deal.\n\n2013: The same issues that helped kill the decades-earlier GeVeCo serefvice, notably lack of interest by consumers and vehicle manufacturers, catch up to Better Place. After raising - and burning through - more than $600 million in investors' money in just six years, the company files for bankruptcy.\n\nStory continues\n\n2013: Tesla offers a limited battery swap service for the new Model S, which was designed from the start to accommodate swappable batteries. The swapping process is arduous (""a pain in the ass,"" recalls a former Tesla executive) and the pilot program is quietly retired in 2015. Tesla CEO Elon Musk orders his team instead to turn its attention instead to building out a proprietary network of charging stations called ""superchargers.""\n\n2014: Nio is established in China, with satellite operations in the United States and Europe. In 2017, it announces a plan to offer customers the option of swappable batteries, a service that it begins in 2018.\n\n(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit and Nick Carey in London; Editing by Pravin Char)","https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/factbox-swapping-electric-car-batteries-231550960.html","GE.MX","GE.US","GEC.LSE","GEOO34.SA","GNE.PA","","","","","","","","","","","","","DAVID A.

"2022-03-22T23:30:00+00:00","Why Are Tesla, Volkswagen And Nio Scrambling For Graphite?","The White House is now more desperate than ever to secure America’s supply chain of critical minerals.\n\nThat includes rare earth elements and battery materials, such as lithium, cobalt, and graphite–all of which are key not only to electric vehicles and energy storage, but to computer components, household appliances, and clean energy technology in general.\n\nChina controls most of this market …\n\nAnd the only truly effective supply chain security move is to bring it all home.\n\nWhile sparse announcements by junior miners exploring North American venues for new sources of these battery materials offer some hope, they are risky opportunities for investors.\n\nThe first company looking to bring one of the most important battery materials back home is Graphex Group Ltd(GRFXY), which has just announced plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\n\nGraphex has operations at home …\n\nBut it is also among the top producers in Asia, with key graphite processing facilities parked right next to one of the world’s biggest graphite mines.\n\nIt’s been producing for nearly a decade already, and now it’s aiming to quadruple production and build a bridge between its Asian and North American operations.\n\nIt’s our pick for a unique opportunity to get positioned in a major expansion that targets the heart of America’s supply chain insecurity–precious battery materials that can make or break the clean energy revolution. And it’s an opportunity with less of the kind of risk that comes with betting on junior miners hedging on a discovery of a commercial nature, and then being able to develop it.\n\nGraphite isn’t a game for new entrants, and Graphex Group is led by veterans with proven production.\n\nDemand for Minerals Like Lithium and Graphite Is Expected To Increase By 4,000%\n\nOver the next few decades, the White House says that global demand for these critical minerals will grow by up to 600%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut more specifically for minerals such as lithium and graphite used in EV batteries, demand will increase by as much as 4,000%.\n\nThe problem, says the White House, is that “The U.S. is increasingly dependent on foreign sources for many of the processed versions of these minerals. Globally, China controls most of the market for processing and refining for cobalt, lithium, rare earths and other critical minerals.”\n\nNow, with the Russian-Ukraine war and the backlash of sanctions feeding a commodity supercycle that was already underway, securing the supply chain for these minerals is even more urgent.\n\nEV sales are expected to double this year, auto giants are motivated to avoid battery supply chain disruptions and rising costs of raw materials.\n\nAnd while lithium tends to get a lot of the attention when it comes to the supply squeeze, graphite is another overlooked critical element here, and analysts project that by 2030, graphite demand will be three times higher than supply.\n\nThat’s a concerning situation, especially for battery manufacturers who are looking at a multi-trillion-dollar industry that is marching forward at breakneck speed …\n\nAn energy storage market that is heading toward $426 billion …\n\nAnd a huge lineup of European battery gigafactories, as well as more than a dozen new ones planned in the United States.\n\nAll of this indicates a global graphite market marching towards $50 billion by the end of this decade.\n\nThat’s because graphite makes up between 20%-30% of the material of every EV or energy storage battery. It’s the anode materials that make a lithium-ion battery possible in the first place.\n\nThe Graphite Bridge from Asia to North America\n\nThe United States currently doesn’t produce any graphite at all, and it can’t process it, either.\n\nAll of the processed graphite in the world comes from Asia, and of that 70% of the mined graphite comes from China. China, in turn, is responsible for processing nearly all of the graphite used by any battery manufacturer in the world.\n\nThat’s a major national security issue and one that Graphex Group is working to help fix.\n\nWith its status as one of the Top 5 spherical graphite producers in China and one of the top in the world, Graphex (GRFXY) is looking to become the group that builds the first bridge over the gap between all that Asian production and a lack of U.S. production.\n\nSince 2013, Graphex Group has been operating right next to one of the biggest graphite mines in the world, in China’s Heilongjiang Province. Right now, it’s producing 10,000 metric tons of spherical graphite–that’s battery grade. But plans are in motion to ramp that up to 40,000 metric tons over the next three years.\n\nThat’s the kind of scaling up that North America desperately needs.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what Graphex Group is doing–it’s bringing its patented technology home so that North America has a processing facility for battery-grade spherical graphite.\n\nA graphite processing plant is being planned for Michigan, with a final location decision expected by the end of this month, and with operations expected to go online within a year.\n\nThe initial targeted capacity for Graphex Group’s “made-in-America” plant would be 10,000 metric tons per annum (TPA), with plans to be able to double that to meet growing demand.\n\nLocalizing the final processing of graphite for EV battery manufacturers–including the 13 American gigafactories in the works–may be vital to supply chain security.\n\nLocalizing the final processing of graphite may also accomplish one other big selling point: It could make it exponentially more reliable for American battery manufacturers. The problem for North American graphite miners now coming on the scene is that they don’t have any proven processing capabilities that would take their mined flake graphite and turn it into what the battery manufacturers need: uncoated or coated spherical graphite.\n\nThat means that even if companies launch more graphite mining operations in the United States, the final end product would still need to be processed in China and our supply chain would likely remain extremely fragile.\n\nGraphex Group is aiming to bridge exactly that gap, by bringing graphite processing technology home.\n\nWe think that’s a huge deal when battery metals prices are soaring and sending ripples through the EV industry.\n\nFor Graphex and its investors, the potential opportunity could be significant.\n\nMichigan processing facilities may just be the beginning …\n\nGraphex (GRFXY) has announced longer-term plans to partner with auto supply chain companies for the production of coated spherical graphite, with downstream expansion into anode and battery production as well as partner with other global raw graphite miners.\n\nGraphite: The Critical Game for Veterans Only\n\nOnce graphite comes out of the ground, it takes high-tech processing to produce battery-grade anode material. It’s a complicated process, particularly when it comes to scaling up operations.\n\nIt’s not a game for new entrants.\n\nGraphex (GRFXY) isn’t a new entrant. It’s one of the world’s top processing companies with long-term contracts with state-owned mines and offtake agreements with major battery manufacturers.\n\nThis isn’t a high-risk exploration play–it’s an expansion play that already has strong margins (28% in 2021) and is now crossing oceans in what could be one of the most important things to happen to U.S. national interest on the critical minerals scene.\n\nIt’s not just about mining …\n\nThis is about the end-product that North America hasn’t had the capability for before.\n\nAnd it’s all being done by what looks to be an extremely well-structured vertical powerhouse along the graphite supply chain.\n\nAgain, this is a company that has battery-grade processing capability in China with its own facilities, an export license for its battery-grade spherical graphite, and plans to build it all up back in North America. And the company’s technology is protected by 23 patents.\n\nThis isn’t about discovery anymore … it’s about discovery plus processing. It’s a high-tech game of scaling up, and Graphex Group looks to be one of the best situated to do that with veterans who are gearing up to provide the United States with its first real supply chain bridge.\n\nElectric Vehicle Producers Are Set To Grow In The Coming Years\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a bona fide Detroit superstar in automotive production. And now it is branching out and ditching internal combustion engines, other legacy automakers will likely follow suit. Though General Motors has been around for a long time, this is a turning point for the company. They're making their best efforts to curb emissions, and it will likely pay off over time. Not only will it keep older shareholders happy, but it could also draw in new investments from younger, sustainability-focused investors.\n\nIn a major announcement last year, the highest-selling U.S. automaker said it would offer 30 all-electric models globally by the middle of this decade. A total of 40 percent of the company’s U.S. models offered will be battery electric vehicles (BEVs) by the end of 2025.\n\nRecently, GM dropped another bomb on the market with the announcement of its new business unit, BrightDrop. The company is looking to capture a key share of the burgeoning delivery market, with plans to sell electric vans and services to commercial delivery companies. GM isn’t just betting big on EVs, either. It’s also looking to capitalize on the autonomous vehicle boom. Recently, it announced that its majority-owned subsidiary, Cruise, has just received approval from the California DMV to test its autonomous vehicles without a driver. And while they’re not the first to receive such an approval, it’s still huge news for GM.\n\nFord (NYSE:F) is another Detroit heavyweight making major waves in the electric vehicle world. In addition to brand-new all-electric versions of its best-sellers, the F-150 and iconic Mustang, it’s also making major moves to carve out its own position in the hydrogen race, as well. In fact, it recently even unveiled the world’s first-ever fuel cell hybrid plugin electric vehicle, the Ford Edge HySeries, a sure sign that Ford is committed to a sustainable future.\n\nFord shocked the markets last year, beating investor favorite Tesla as the top performing automaker, as it doubled down on an all-electric future. 2021 was “truly a breakthrough year for Ford … easily the most important year strategically for the company since the financial crisis,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas told CNBC.\n\nChinese EV Makers Are Back In Fashion\n\nNio Limited (NYSE:NIO), one of Tesla’s biggest rivals in China, is looking to take on the king in its back yard. The company is ramping up sales and trimming its financials and starting to make headway domestically. And while it saw a bit of a setback as the wider-Chinese market dipped, support from the government could help ease investors’ concerns.\n\nNio isn’t just producing electric vehicles, either. It’s also making major waves in the battery market. Nio plans to build 4,000 battery-swapping stations worldwide by 2025, Reuters has reported, citing the company’s president Qin Lihong.\n\nBattery swapping is emerging as a quicker alternative to EV charging, which often still takes hours, making electric vehicles a little less appealing to potential buyers. But swapping a battery could provide a quick and easily solution for drivers-on-the-go.\n\nAnother Chinese automaker, Xpeng Motors (NYSE:XPEV), is also looking to carve out its own places in the super-competitive EV market. It has developed an all-electric, fully autonomous car that can be ordered with a few taps on your phone. It features a range of 250 miles and will get you from point A to B in less time than it would take to hail a cab or drive yourself.   This game-changing company is set to disrupt the world's automotive industry with unmatched convenience and accessibility.\n\nXpeng has also been drawing plenty of interest from Big Money, managing to raise nearly a billion dollars from heavy hitters such as Alibaba, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Qatar Investment Authority, Hillhouse Capital, and Sequoia Capital China.\n\nChina’s electric vehicle boom is just getting started, and Xpeng could stand to win big. This year, robust growth is set to continue because subsidies are no longer a factor, said Michael J. Dunne, CEO at ZoZo Go.\n\n""Until 2020, most EV sales in China were induced via subsidies, rebates and quotas. That era is over. NIO, Xpeng and BYD are building world-class EVs that Chinese buyers are embracing on their own merits. Subsidies are no longer a factor.”\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is also gaining traction in the exploding Chinese market. And while it may not be a veteran in the market like Tesla or even NIO, it’s quickly making waves on Wall Street as the Chinese government vows to support its internationally listed companies. Backed by tech giants Meituan and Bytedance, Li has taken a different approach to the electric vehicle market. Instead of opting for pure-electric cars, it is giving consumers a choice with its innovative crossover hybrid SUV. This popular vehicle can be powered with gasoline or electricity, helping ease one of the biggest worries associated with electric vehicle adoption: a lack of charging infrastructure.\n\nLi Auto, along with a number of other Chinese companies, has taken a beating this year, falling by 28% since January. But investors would be wise to not shrug off Chinese companies just yet. Just this week, Chinese companies saw a massive rally following news that Bejing was taking much-needed steps to support domestic companies, stabilize Chinese markets, and bolster economic growth for the country.\n\nCanada Is Set To Win Big in The EV Boom, As Well\n\nGreenPower Motor (TSX:GPV) is an exciting company that produces larger-scale electric transportation.  Right now, it is primarily focused on the North American market, but the sky is the limit as the pressure to go green grows. GreenPower has been on the frontlines of the electric movement, manufacturing affordable battery-electric busses and trucks for over ten years. From school busses to long-distance public transit, GreenPower’s impact on the sector can’t be ignored.\n\nNFI Group (TSX:NFI) is another one of Canada’s most exciting electric mass-transit makers. Though it has not yet rebounded from January highs, NFI still offers investors a promising opportunity to capitalize on the electric vehicle boom at a discount. In addition to its increasingly positive financial reports, it is also one of the few in the business that actually pay dividends out to its investors. This is huge because it gives investors an opportunity to gain exposure to this booming industry while the stock is cheap and hold steady until the market finally discovers this gem.\n\nAnother way to gain exposure to the electric vehicle industry is through AutoCanada (TSX:ACQ), a company that operates auto-dealerships through Canada. The company carries a wide variety of new and used vehicles and has all types of financial options available to fit the needs of any consumer. While sales have slumped this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, AutoCanada will likely see a rebound as both buying power and the demand for electric vehicles increases. As more new exciting EVs hit the market, AutoCanada will surely be able to ride the wave.\n\nDon’t Forget To Keep An Eye On Miners Are Supply Shortages Loom\n\nLithium Americas Corp. (TSX:LAC) is one of North America’s most important and successful pure-play lithium companies, making it a key frontrunner in the commodity price boom. With two world-class lithium projects in Argentina and Nevada, Lithium Americas is well-positioned to ride the wave of growing lithium demand in the years to come. It’s already raised nearly a billion dollars in equity and debt, showing that investors have a ton of interest in the company’s ambitious plans, and it will likely continue its promising growth and expansion for years to come. Especially if lithium prices continue to soar.\n\nIt’s not ignoring the growing demand from investors for responsible and sustainable mining, either. In fact, one of its primary goals is to create a positive impact on society and the environment through its projects.\n\nTurquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TSX:TRQ) is another major player in Canada’s resource and mineral industry. It is a major producer of coal and zinc, two resources with distinctly different futures. While headlines are already touting the end of coal, zinc is a mineral that will play a key role in the future of energy for years and years to come. And due in part to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, zinc has seen its price soar on fears of a looming supply squeeze.\n\nIn addition to its zinc operations, Turquoise Hill is also a significant producer of Uranium. Uranium is a key material in the production of nuclear energy, which many analysts are suggesting could be a major component in the global transition to cleaner energy. While the mineral has not seen significant price action in recent years, there are a number of new projects set to come online across the globe in the medium term, which could be a boon to Turquoise Hill, especially as commodity prices explode.\n\nBy.

"2022-02-17T19:41:59+00:00","Tesla co-founder seeks to solve California's battery waste problem","A miner peers into a rare earth mineral mine in Mountain Pass, Calif. Such mines are expanding worldwide. Battery recycling could reduce the growth rate of new mines needed to feed the electric vehicle market. (Don Bartletti / Los Angeles Times)\n\nElectric vehicles may be cleaner than gasoline or diesel fuel cars and trucks. That doesn't mean they're clean. Their batteries depend on toxic metals whose mining and improper disposal cause environmental degradation, not to mention child-labor abuses in source countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nFor the last 5 years, a Nevada company run by a Tesla co-founder has been attempting to address such problems with a battery recycling center in Nevada. On Thursday, the company, Redwood Materials, announced a used battery collection program for California, with Ford and Volvo as project-launch partners.\n\nThe automakers will work with their own dealers and with battery dismantlers to package and transport dead or near-dead electric vehicle batteries by truck to Redwood's plant in Carson City. There, battery materials such as cobalt and copper will be extracted and transformed into new battery parts, then sold to battery makers — starting with Panasonic's battery plant in Sparks, Nev.\n\nA robust recycling system would not only help the environment, it could reduce some of the dependency of the U.S. on overseas mining of rare earth minerals and other battery ingredients, the processing of which is dominated by China.\n\nThe economics are unclear, as are the business prospects for Redwood. Electric vehicle batteries are not easy to recycle, and developing untried processes is expensive.\n\nRedwood is a private company founded by Tesla co-founder J.B. Straubel, who left the electric carmaker to launch the venture. Straubel is a battery expert and a crucial but largely unsung contributor to Tesla's success.\n\nMarket-size figures are hard to come by in this nascent industry, but according to London consulting firm Circular Energy Storage, there about a hundred companies worldwide that recycle lithium ion batteries or plan to do so. Most are in China and South Korea. But logistics and transportation account for a huge share of recycling costs, Straubel said. California is by far the largest market for electric vehicles in the U.S., so feeding dead batteries across the border into Nevada can keep those costs manageable, he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Carson City plant currently employs about 300 workers. Straubel said that as the EV market grows, the company will build new plants, starting with Europe and an additional plant in the U.S. Asked whether California will be a candidate for a new U.S. plant, Straubel demurred. At the least, he said, Redwood will be setting up operations in California to collect batteries and prepare them for transport.\n\nRedwood isn't restricted to car battery recycling. It is also inviting consumers to send in their battery-powered electronics to Redwood.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.","https://news.yahoo.com/tesla-co-founder-seeks-solve-194159848.html","TL0.F","TL0.XETRA","TSLA.MX","TSLA.US","TSLA34.SA","","","","","","","","","","","","","BATTERY MATERIALS","CALIF","ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERIES","LITHIUM ION BATTERIES","LOS ANGELES TIMES","RARE EARTH MINERAL","REDWOOD MATERIALS","TESLA","","","","0.893","0.033","0.917","0.051"

But, for the most part, the traders making money from QuantumScape have been short sellers.\n\nYet, with QS stock hitting an all-time low recently, some investors may be considering buying shares as a long-term investment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s run through some of the pros and cons.\n\nQuantumScape Is Broadening Its Use Case\n\nQuantumScape develops solid-state lithium-metal batteries for electric vehicles. The company has 200 patents and patent applications relating to its battery technology. While rising interest rates may make it difficult for other non-revenue companies in the space to get financing, QuantumScape’s intellectual property and category leadership should carry some weight.\n\n7 Stocks to Buy as the Market Shakes Off Omicron Fears\n\nMoreover, a recent deal with Fluence Energy (NASDAQ:FLNC) will expand the company’s solid-state battery technology to stationary energy storage applications.\n\nFor a company that is still pre-revenue, I believe this is significant. As QuantumScape said in the press release accompanying the deal, “Stationary energy storage installations are expected to grow by more than 2,000% from 2020 to 2030, representing a $385 billion global market opportunity.”\n\nAnd the company still has a partnership with Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY). The automaker aims to have EVs account for half of its vehicle sales by the end of the decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Solid-State the New Betamax?\n\nQuantumScape is not projected to start generating revenue from its existing solid-state battery technology until 2024. My biggest concern with QuantumScape isn’t the company’s ability to bring a product to market. It’s what the market will look like by the time solid-state batteries arrive. Perhaps this won’t be so much of an issue a few years from now, but it’s fair to wonder what the state of play in the EV market will be 10 years down the road.\n\nThe situation reminds me of VCR technology Betamax and its failure to catch on in the United States. It wasn’t that Betamax failed to do what it was designed to do. In fact, it was widely considered to be the best. But another product came along that was cheaper and better marketed, and that was the end of Betamax.\n\nAlready it’s clear that there will be more than one EV battery solution. Many electric vehicle manufacturers are committed to traditional lithium-ion batteries. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to make a considerable investment in this technology.\n\nWhile there are limitations to lithium-ion batteries, the technology is evolving to provide the most range per charge. And there is an expectation that the charging station network will get beefed up whether or not it’s funded in part by the Biden administration’s infrastructure bill.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese EV maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) continues to move forward with its battery-as-a-service (BaaS) program. This is a different approach to removing range anxiety from the EV battery equation.\n\nClass-Action Lawsuits Are a Red Flag\n\nIn addition to competition and the fact that solid-state batteries have not shown they are commercially feasible, there’s another cause for concern with QS stock.\n\nQuantumScape is facing a shareholder lawsuit. As InvestorPlace contributor Samuel O’Brient notes, “Shareholders are alleging that the company lied about both battery quality and performance-measuring tests.”\n\nAt worst, the suit will validate many investors’ skepticism since the company was brought public. At best, it’s likely to put downward pressure on QS stock until the lawsuit is resolved.\n\nThe Bottom Line on QS Stock\n\nThe first thing you need to understand with QuantumScape is that your risk of the company potentially going bankrupt is not zero. In fact, with the lawsuit it faces, it may be higher (in terms of percentage) than the single digits. That’s reason enough to keep a position in QS stock small.\n\nHowever, while speculative stocks are inherently gambles, that doesn’t mean they aren’t gambles worth taking. Solid-state batteries may have a role as a niche offering. Even Betamax wound up having some success in Japan.\n\nI like QS stock a lot better at $16 a share than I did when it was $40 a share and certainly more than when it was trading for over $100 per share. That being said, the lawsuit is enough to keep me away, but your risk tolerance may be different.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

"2022-02-02T11:00:40+00:00","3 Best Battery Stocks to Charge Up Your Portfolio","The electric vehicle (EV) revolution is in full swing and the critical component driving it forward is batteries – and battery stocks.\n\nThe market for the batteries that power EVs is red-hot as the switch from gasoline-powered vehicles surges ahead. According to Markets and Research, the EV battery market is expected to reach $175.11 billion by 2028 for a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26%.\n\nAnd as automakers from Ford (NYSE:F) to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) ramp up their EV production and introduce new models of fully electric cars, trucks and SUVs, the demand for batteries is only expected to intensify.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n7 Lesser-Known Retail Stocks to Check Out Now\n\nThe good news for investors is that the current market downturn has made many electric vehicle stocks down right cheap to buy. Here are three of the best battery stocks to charge up your portfolio.\n\nChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT) Albemarle Corp. (NYSE:ALB) Nio (NYSE:NIO)\n\nBest Battery Stocks: ChargePoint (CHPT) A close-up of an orange ChargePoint (CHPT) station.\n\nSource: JL IMAGES / Shutterstock.com\n\nCampbell, California-based ChargePoint just got a big jolt of electricity after JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) upgraded the company’s stock to “outperform” from “neutral,” along with a $20 price target.\n\nCHPT stock shot up 10% on the day that JPMorgan made the upgrade, noting in its assessment that ChargePoint has a huge growth opportunity ahead of it and that investors are overly concerned about profits in the near-term for the company that operates the biggest network of electric vehicle battery charging stations in the world.\n\n“We think investors may be too pessimistic on ChargePoint’s expenses and path to profitability,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Bill Peterson.\n\nThe upgrade by JPMorgan was the best news that ChargePoint and its shareholders received since the company went public in March 2021 via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal. In the past six months, CHPT stock is down 41%. And that’s after the 10% jump following the positive note from JPMorgan. In the last month, ChargePoint’s stock has declined 27%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, given its leading market position in the U.S., aggressive expansion in Europe, and presence in 14 countries worldwide, there is still reason to be bullish on the long-term prospects for ChargePoint and its network of EV charging stations.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle is the largest provider of lithium for electric vehicle batteries, and business is booming. The specialty chemicals company controls over half of the world’s lithium and lithium storage products, which are in high demand as established automakers and start-ups race to rollout electric vehicles and leave the combustion engine behind.\n\nLithium prices last year jumped nearly 500% higher as global electric vehicle sales rose 160%. And lithium production is forecast to more than triple to more than 1.1 million tons by 2025 from 300,000 tons in 2020.\n\nAlbemarle is taking full advantage of the huge demand for the lithium used in electric vehicle batteries. The company announced that it will spend $1.5 billion over the next five years on new lithium projects in Nevada, Australia and China.\n\nAs long as the company is able to continue growing and maintain its global lead, Albemarle should continue rewarding shareholders. ALB stock has been pulled down 5% year to date amid broader market volatility. However, the share price is still up 35% over the past 12 months. Expect more gains going forward.\n\nBest Battery Stocks: Nio (NIO) NIO stock: A shot from the outside of a Nio display room at night.\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nShanghai, China-based Nio does not just make electric vehicles. It also makes the batteries that go into its cars and has pioneered a “battery as a service” (BaaS) model that is proving to be very popular in the Asian nation of 1.4 billion people.\n\nThe model sees owners of Nio vehicles pull into designated service stations to switch out their drained batteries for freshly charged ones, in the same way that consumers swap their empty barbecue propane tanks for filled ones at Costco (NASDAQ:COST). The service saves Nio customers from having to buy and install expensive battery charging systems in their homes. And the monthly subscription model provides Nio with a steady income stream.\n\nNio is now taking its BaaS model to Europe, where it recently expanded. And while Nio stock has been badly beaten down over the past year, many analysts say the shares are a buy now that they recently traded at a 52-week low of just over $20 a share. NIO stock is down 22% year-to-date and has declined an eye-watering 57% in the past 12 months. However, the median price target on the company’s shares among 25 Wall Street analysts who cover the company is $58.22.\n\nBased on the price targets, the view is clearly that the sell-off in Nio stock has been overdone.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
