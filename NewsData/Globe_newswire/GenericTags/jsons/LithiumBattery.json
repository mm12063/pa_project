Supply Chain Integration Supported By Strong Market Demands &amp; Increased Production Capacity","content":"NEW YORK, May 31, 2022 \/PRNewswire\/ -- On May 19, 2022, CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: CBAT), a leading China-based lithium-ion battery manufacturer and electric energy solution provider released its first quarter earnings ended March 31, 2022.\n\nMomentous Revenue Growth\n\nCBAT kicked off 2022 with net revenues in 1Q-2022 surging more than eight-fold year-over-year to reach $80.2 million; of which, $65 million was from lithium battery cells materials business acquired from Hitran's merger completed in 4Q-2022. Nevertheless, demand for CBAT's high power lithium batteries has continued to prove robust.\n\nSales of the Company's high-power lithium-ion batteries increased ~70% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2022, especially driven by the Light Electric Vehicle end-product application, as well as by the continued momentum in its Uninterruptible Supplies products, achieved even when CBAT was still ramping up production capacity at its Nanjing battery manufacturing facility.\n\nCBAK Energy's production facilities, both in Dalian and Nanjing, currently have a total battery production capacity of 2GWh, and its Nanjing facility is ramping towards a maximum capacity of 18GWh. Based on the strong lithium batteries sales registered in 1Q-2022, CBAT has tremendous potential to multiply its battery sales once the facility has reached its maximum production capacity, supported by strong market demand from the EV and LEV battery ecosystem.\n\nStrong Order Backlog with More Larger Orders Expected in The Near Term\n\nOwing to the positive market feedback on the Company's products, CBAT has an order backlog of approximately $69 million as of May 9, 2022, including the order for lithium-ion batteries supply worth of ~$29.3 million from a leading European provider of heating, cooling and renewable energy systems company, to be met by the full capacity at its main factory in Dalian, together with increased production at its Nanjing plant.\n\nCBAT also expects to receive more orders in the coming quarters, and some in bigger orders starting in the 3rd quarter of 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecent Product Development & 2022 Operating Focus\n\nCBAT continued to develop Large Cylindrical batteries targeting at the LEV and passenger-grade EV markets. The design and R&D for model 42140 battery were completed, and its model prototype production is being worked on catered to the robust market demand.\n\nThe Company's main focus in the second quarter is to maintain stable revenues from its uninterruptible supplies and raw material businesses, and will also continue to expand its large-cylindrical batteries through signing new contracts with the LEV and EV manufacturer customers.\n\nParticularly benefiting from the rapidly rising global commodity prices, the new raw material business resulting from Hitran's acquisition has now accounted for a major stream of the Company's total revenues. With reliable product quality, Hitran is able to develop and accumulate a number of strategic customers, and is now in full production and expected to further make high nickel, cathode materials used for EV safety and driving range improvement.\n\n3-Step Strategic Plan to Counter Material Price Hikes and Improve Margins\n\nIn order to combat the impact of rising raw material costs which decreased the profitability of its downstream battery production, CBAT management is proactively taking measures in three main aspects:\n\nStep 1. Sign long-term supply agreements with major suppliers to secure major materials supplies.\n\nStep 2. Expand into the upstream raw material business and use material price inflation to offset the decrease in gross margins of battery plants.\n\nStep 3. Renegotiate prices with downstream customers to successfully raise product prices for the Company's key customers.\n\nManagement expects the gross margin to improve once its raw-material production capacity and downstream price increases are implemented through the 3-step strategic plan, and subsequently becomes a leading lithium-ion battery and electric energy solutions provider, with secured raw materials and augmented downstream battery production capacity, despite the short-term pressure on the Company's cash flow by the rising material prices.\n\nThe Company also plans to actively search for quality assets for value-add acquisitions, aiming at stabilized supply chain and enhanced investment returns.\n\nFirst Quarter 2022 Financial Highlights\n\nNet revenues were $80.2 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 752%, and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 188%. The increases were mainly driven by incremental revenues from integrating lithium battery materials business post Hitran acquisition, as well as by ~70% year-over-year growth in high power lithium batteries sales.\n\nAdditionally in terms of net revenues by end-product applications, revenues from high power lithium batteries used in LEV grew 329% YoY in the quarter.\n\n1Q-2022 gross profit margin was 6.6%, down from 19.5% in 1Q-2021 while up from 3.7% in 4Q-2021, primarily due to the increase in raw material costs, which are expected to abate when new capacity is being added by the overall industry.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased 256% YoY, primarily due to growing headcount and consolidation of Hitran; among which, R&D expense in particular increased 585% YoY, coupled with 290% YoY increase in Sales & Marketing expenses. Despite the increases, operating expenses was limited to 8.3% of revenues in the quarter, down significantly from 19.8% from a year ago.\n\nNet income attributable to CBAT shareholders was $0.4 million, compared to $29.6 million in 1Q-2021 when the fair value of its warrant's liability decreased significantly due to lower stock prices, which in turn led to higher GAAP earnings. Change in CBAT warrant's fair value was merely $1.6 million in 1Q-2022, compared to $28.4 million in the same period of 2021. Basic and fully-diluted net income per share were both $0.01 in the quarter, compared to a net income per share of $0.35 in 1Q-2021.\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $5.6 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $7.4 million as of December 31, 2021.\n\nDISCLOSURES AND DISCLAIMERS\n\nStone Street Group LLC (\"Stone Street\") publishes research reports on publicly-traded companies.

Tougher regulation is a risk for firms in the world's No. 2 lithium producer and No. 1 for copper.\n\n\"You can explain the effects specifically from lithium extraction,\" said Cristina Dorador, co-author of the study in the Royal Society's Proceedings B journal, referring to findings that flamingo numbers dropped as more water was used up.\n\nThe scientists examined salt flats throughout Chile to measure the effects of other variables on water levels. Satellite imagery of mining ponds on the Atacama, home to most of Chile's lithium, was used to calculate how much water was extracted.\n\nFlamingos reproduce less with less water, which over time could impact herd numbers, said co-author Nathan Senner, a researcher of ecosystems and environmental change.\n\n\"It's not like they all die at once, but if you're not reproducing all of a sudden, even things that live as long as flamingos start to die. And that's where numbers really start to tumble quite rapidly.\"\n\nIn other salt flats without mining, flamingo populations remained steady over the last decade despite natural water variations linked to rainfall and climate shifts. In the Atacama, though, James and Andean flamingos declined 10-12%.\n\nStory continues\n\nChile's National Mining Society declined to comment. Albemarle Corp, one of the main two lithium miners in Chile, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSQM, the other main lithium miner, disagreed with key parts of the study, saying in a statement that its own monitoring indicated that \"flamingo populations have remained stable.\"\n\nSQM said satellite analysis could considerably over- or under-estimate water use, and called for more research on the ground.\n\nDorador, a scientist from the region and an elected official working on Chile's new constitution, said locals have noticed a decline in flamingos in the salt flats affected by mining for years.\n\n\"They are incredibly important because they're one of big tourist attractions of San Pedro de Atacama,\" said Dorador.\n\nDorador said indigenous elders collect flamingo eggs on the flats for their regular diet, while the birds regulate the ecosystem eating plankton, crustaceans and microorganisms, helping avoid damaging bacterial blooms on the water.\n\nChile's flamingo numbers overall have held up, thanks to herds on other flats not affected by mining. But the consequences could be severe as demand spikes for lithium batteries powering electric vehicles, Dorador warned.\n\n\"We have to think where these materials come from, because we're not always aware. We buy all these things but we often don't know what had to happen to make that product.\" (Reporting by Alexander Villegas and Cristian Rudolffi; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Richard Chang)","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/chiles-atacama-lithium-mining-stirs-100000107.html","symbols":["ALB.US","AMC.F","HG.COMM"],"tags":["ATACAMA DESERT","CHILE","CRISTINA DORADOR","LITHIUM BATTERIES","PINK FLAMINGOS","SALT FLATS"],"sentiment":{"polarity":-0.948,"neg":0.068,"neu":0.897,"pos":0.035}},{"date":"2022-05-19T09:30:00+00:00","title":"CBAK Energy Reports First Quarter 2022 Unaudited Financial Results","content":"\u2013 Net revenues up 752% year over year in the first quarter \u2013\n\nDALIAN, China, May 19, 2022 \/PRNewswire\/ --\u00a0CBAK Energy Technology, Inc.

Although it has noble aspirations \u2014 to deliver attractive, high-performance EVs armed with groundbreaking solid-state batteries (SSBs) \u2014 almost everyone has big dreams. It\u2019s executing the vision that separates the viable from the also-rans, which is why you should steer clear of MULN stock.\n\nOutside of its snazzy marketing literature, nothing really stands out to suggest that Mullen is a credible EV disrupter. InvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth said it best when he compared the financial outlays that the company made relative to its peers. \u201cMullen spent just $3.1 million on research and development in 2021, just 2% of what QuantumScape (NYSE:QS), a leading developer of solid-state lithium batteries, spent. Yet, Mullen\u2019s market capitalization is almost 6% of QuantumScape\u2019s $5.06 billion valuation.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTherefore, if you\u2019re bullish on MULN stock, you\u2019ve got to suspend disbelief and assume that with far fewer research and development dollars \u2014 and with arguably lower engineering acumen \u2014 that Mullen can nevertheless beat its far better capitalized and established rivals. Granted, it\u2019s not an impossible circumstance, but I would consider it highly improbable.\n\n7 Great Growth Stocks to Buy in May\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about raw spending power \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 that worries me about MULN stock. There\u2019s the other component that advanced, potentially game-changing technologies like SSBs require time to finetune their nuances and complexities. For instance, recent research suggests that SSBs may not be necessarily safer than their conventional lithium-ion counterparts. Such findings, if proven legitimate, could negate one of the key benefits of SSB integration.\n\nStory continues\n\nAside from this enormous challenge, Mullen would also have to overcome the unique struggles associated with the automotive supply chain disruption. Combined with inflationary pressures, the price of EVs have continued to swing higher and higher, far outside the reach of median-income households. Should Mullen be forced to compete in the premium space, it then faces the prospect of going up against heavy hitters like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID).\n\nWith so many question marks surrounding Mullen, it\u2019s best to sit on the sidelines regarding MULN stock. It has little going right for it and way more things that can go wrong.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

China represents the largest regional market for Supercapacitors, accounting for an estimated 22.6% share of the global total. The market is projected to reach US$1.2 Billion by the end of the analysis period. China is expected to spearhead growth and emerge as the fastest growing regional market with a CAGR of 24.2% over the analysis period.\n\nSupercapacitors, also known as Ultracapacitors are gaining in prominence as an attractive alternate technology capable of overthrowing the shortfalls and performance gap of conventional batteries. Years of refining technology innovation have helped supercapacitors progress steadily towards achieving successful commercialization in key end-use industries, such as, energy, automobiles, medical devices and consumer electronics.\n\nThis alternative energy storage technology which was hitherto bogged down by a high cost structure and complexities in manufacturing, today stands at the vanguard of an era of practical usage.\n\nAlthough continuous technology innovations are helping increase the safety and capability of supercapacitors, the technology is not expected to completely replace batteries which still continue to have cost and size advantages. Lithium ion batteries have higher energy densities over 20 times higher when compared to a superconductor and are capable of storing 30 times more energy than their weight. In comparison, supercapacitors have very high power density which means energy can be released rapidly in powerful bursts and can be charged quickly. Combining both the technologies into a hybrid technology is gaining in prominence.\n\nA hybrid supercapacitor\/battery configuration is considered to be an ideal solution for applications with high power demands, as they benefit from both high power density feature of supercapacitors and superior energy storage capability of battery. Supercapacitors will remain a supplementary technology to batteries and engines that run on fuels in most applications - for example electric vehicles that need short bursts of power for acceleration. Although standalone use of supercapacitors in automobiles is still not a widespread practice, the numerous advantages offered, such as, its ecological benignity, higher energy conservation through efficient exploitation of existing power sources, superior conductivity, and physical and chemical stability, among others, promise a robust future in store.\n\nNevertheless, complete replacement will be seen in certain applications such as offshore wind turbines, where the technology is aptly suited for providing short bursts of power needed to adjust turbine blades in changing wind conditions; and hybrid buses where supercapacitors can completely replace batteries given their ability to quickly capture energy from regenerative braking systems and discharge the power for ignition. In the energy industry, renewable energy sources are especially characterized by variable power supply, requiring the use of supercapacitors, which flaunt superior power density, and the ability to facilitate 'load leveling' of power, thereby ensuring stable supply of power.\r\n\r\nThe technology`s quick response time makes them highly desirable for static condenser (STATCON), and dynamic voltage regulator (DVR) applications, since power can be rapidly absorbed or injected to help reduce voltage fluctuations. Strong potential lies in store for the use of supercapacitors in renewable energy production, given the indelible mark being made by renewable energy across the globe, and ensuing spotlight being shed on environment friendly energy storage technologies. The unmet energy storage needs opens up opportunities for alternative energy storage solutions such as flywheels, fuel cell and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) in addition to supercapacitors. Supercapacitors especially as efficient energy storage technology aims to replace the battery technology in the long term.\r\n\r\nSelect Competitors-\n\nAVX Corp.CAP-XX LimitedEaton Corporation plcELNALoxus Inc.KORCHIPMaxwell Technologies Inc.Nippon Chemi-ConPanasonicSeiko Instruments Inc.Shanghai Aowei Technology Development Co.

If you want to skip reading about how and why lithium prices are skyrocketing, you can go directly to 5 Best Lithium Stock To Buy Now.\n\nLithium prices are rallying during the EV boom. As concerns about climate change and global warming alarm governments to take action, and the global economy transitions to electrified transport and abandons combustion engines, the demand for lithium is bound to skyrocket. The biggest industrial application of lithium as of now is its use in powertrains of electric vehicles. Every big player in the automobile manufacturing industry has announced its plans to go all-electric at some point in the future, with some targeting achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2035, and others planning all-electric fleets by 2050. Lithium manufacturers and miners are looking at lucrative days ahead, as the demand for lithium grows catalyzed by global EV adoption.\n\nGlobal EV Adoption\n\nAccording to Statista, even though a semiconductor shortage resulted in a rough year for the automobile industry in 2021, global electric vehicle sales saw a two-fold increase compared to 2020, peaking at 6.6 million up from 3 million. According to the EV volumes data, cited by the International Energy Agency, all net growth in global car sales in 2021 can be attributed to EVs. China was leading in 2021 having almost tripled electric car sales from 1.2 to 3.4 million. Europe was the runner-up region that reported new car registrations up by 70% from 2020, hitting 2.3 million, roughly half of which had electric powertrains. For the first time in history, new car sales crossed 1 million in the United States, and more than half of which were electric cars.\n\nStrong Demand For Lithium Ahead\n\nAccording to S&P Global Commodity Insights, the demand for lithium is expected to further strengthen in 2022. S&P Global Platts data shows that seaborne lithium carbonate prices went up by 413% in 2021 and hit $32,600 per metric ton last December. Lithium hydroxide prices gained 254% over the same period to reach $31,900 per metric ton. Lithium chemical supply is expected to hit 636,000 metric tons, up from roughly 497,000 metric tons in 2021. The demand for lithium is forecasted to grow to 641,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2022, up from 504,000 metric tons in 2021. This creates a deficit of 5,000 metric tons, down from a deficit of 8,000 metric tons in 2021, and according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, this deficit is expected to drive lithium prices to record highs in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoaring lithium prices have resulted in EV manufacturers pondering about creating their own lithium power plants. This April, a tweet highlighted the exponential growth of the price of lithium from $4,450 per tonne in 2012 to $78,032 per tonne as of April 2022. Shortly after, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, Inc.

Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.\r\n\r\nThere is no shortage of the element itself, as lithium is almost everywhere on Earth, but pace of extraction\/refinement is slow.\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 8, 2022\n\nThe demand has accelerated so quickly that it prompted Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk to tweet that his company should consider mining the metal itself.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cImagine those supply constraints, but magnified five, six, seven, eight, nine,10 times,\u201d Eurasia Group U.S. Director Clayton Allen told Yahoo Finance, pointing to President Biden's goal to halve the number of new gas-powered car sales by 2030.\n\n\u201cI think the thing that people ignore is that if Biden gets his way, it wouldn't just be that you would have 50% EV sales by 2030,\u201d Allen added. \u201cThe market share of EVs will increase steadily to that point. It's going to put a lot of demand into a market that already has people asking, 'How are we going to fill this?'\u201d\n\n'The whole supply chain can be located here'\n\nThe geology of the Salton Sea offers a solution for carmakers looking to localize their supply chains, according to Colwell.\n\nThe region already offers more geothermal capacity than anywhere in the world and has the potential to power more than 1.5 million homes. The brine that flows to the surface in the process of power generation also contains enough lithium to produce 600,000 tons of the mineral every year, which the California Energy Commission estimated to be six times the amount produced globally in 2021.\n\nAt its Hell\u2019s Kitchen plant, CTR envisions a full-scale operation that mines lithium using renewable energy, within driving distance of key EV manufacturers in Southern California and Mexico. Electric vehicle and component makers have begun flocking to the area.\n\nLast summer, General Motors (GM) signed a strategic investment with CTR to secure lithium directly from the plant. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which already operates 10 geothermal plants, announced its own plans to explore lithium extraction at scale in Imperial Valley. And Italian firm Italvolt recently launched a new company to develop a lithium battery gigafactory in the area with a production capacity that would serve roughly 650,000 electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe whole supply chain can be located here in the Imperial Valley or Lithium Valley,\u201d Colwell said.

Imperial County is among the poorest counties in the state with nearly 20 percent of its residents living in poverty.\n\n\u201cIndustries are well known to fall short on their promises,\u201d Salton Sea Program Director Frank Ruiz told Yahoo Finance. \u201cAnd that can be the case unless an education pipeline is designed that will allow young kids to have a foot in those professions, identifying how many chemists, how many engineers, how many entry-level positions this industry will need, and making sure that these kids are put in the pipeline to get to those jobs.\u201d\n\nCommunities in the Imperial Valley face challenges other than poverty. The shrinking desert lake poses a health hazard to nearby residents, creating an elevated asthma risk from the lung-irritating dust that rises from Salton Sea\u2019s increasingly exposed bed. And the conditions have been exacerbated by an ongoing megadrought in the region.

The latest Salton Sea report from the California Natural Resources Agency shows that $113.5 million of state funding over the past two decades has been spent mostly on studies, planning, staff, and consultants. Relatively little has gone to actual construction at the lake.\n\nSylvia Paz, executive director of the local non-profit group Alianza, said even fewer investments have gone towards the community\u2019s infrastructure needs.\n\nIn a recent call with the White House, Paz implored President Biden to consider these needs beyond economic opportunities and highlighted the region\u2019s history of \u201cunfulfilled promises.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have people who are willing and want to work. What we do not have is adequate roads, adequate transmission lines, or electricity for housing,\u201d said Paz, who also serves as Chair of the newly formed Lithium Valley Commission. \u201cWe need to look holistically about what the needs are. What are the opportunities to be investing in order for us to start filling in those gaps.\u201d Clouds and nearby mountains are reflected in a polluted canal, once used as a boating dock, along the Salton Sea in Desert Shores, Calif., Wednesday, July 14, 2021. (AP Photo\/Marcio Jose Sanchez)\n\nAt the same time, Paz said she sees the tide shifting, in part because of the focus on domestic production of critical minerals at the state and federal levels in addition to financial incentives to drive the growth.\n\nLast month, Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to fast-track domestic mining and production of EV battery materials. Paz said firms are also providing scholarships to enroll students in STEM courses to develop a pipeline for talent for companies expanding their footprint locally.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s interest in continuing this research to rapidly convert lithium from the brine of geothermal energy to battery-grade lithium in order to really bring economic opportunity,\u201d Congressman Raul Ruiz, a Democrat representing California\u2019s 36th Congressional District, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cBut without the meaningful consultation from local community residents and labor groups, and without tying it to the public health threat, and improving infrastructure for local communities, then it's not gonna be complete.\u201d\n\nAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Sales of high power lithium batteries grew 92% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2021. Among which, revenues from high power lithium batteries used in LEV increased 3631% and 1779% year-over-year in 4Q-2021 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe demonstrated strong financial and operational performance was also attributed to the stable supply of lithium-ion batteries raw materials, secured by CBAT's acquisition of majority stake in Zhejiang Hitrans Lithium Battery Technology Co. in November 2021, allowing the Company to build out its battery product ecosystem and scale the business. Having stable raw materials supply is especially crucial in an environment of rising commodity prices.\n\nWith the growth momentum in LEVs and EVs expected to remain strong in the foreseeable future, the Company has been mindful of the rising battery demands, and will continue to focus on scaling its battery production capacity, as well as expanding its battery material business to drive growth and cement its industry position as a frontrunner and leader in lithium-ion battery production and electric energy solutions. According to the Company, CBAT's Dalian lithium battery manufacturing plant is producing the model 26650\/26700 battery at full capacity. As of March, CBAT had ~ $36 million outstanding battery orders from its Dalian facility and 90% end users were overseas.\n\nStory continues\n\nCBAT's material business is expected to be benefited by the rising material price; According to the Company, CBAT's material business unit is at full capacity. Considering the rising prices and the fact that the market is getting hotter, CBAT's material business is expected to grow quickly.\n\nFor the full year of 2021, on top of the 40% year-over-year revenue growth, CBAT continued to expand its gross margin levels by 2.5% to 9.7%, driven by a higher proportion of high-power lithium batteries sales, coupled with the addition of material business from the acquisition of Hitrans, resulting in a net income of $61.5 million, compared to a net loss of $7.8 million in 2020.\n\nAdditionally, CBAT continues to invest in new headcounts, new business and R&D (up 252% YoY in 4Q-2021). These investments, together with the Company's comprehensive battery product ecosystem are expected to drive sustainable long-term growth for the Company.\n\nFourth Quarter and Full Year of 2021 Financial Highlights\n\nNet revenues were $27.8 million in 4Q-2021, representing a year-over-year increase of 80%, mainly driven by 92% year-over-year growth in high power lithium batteries sales, as well as consolidating the post-acquisition lithium battery materials revenues from Nov. 25, 2021 to Dec. 31, 2021. For the full year of 2021, net revenues increased 40% YoY to $52.7 million from $37.6 million in 2020.\n\nIn terms of net revenues by end-product applications, revenues from high power lithium batteries used in LEV were $485,000 and $733,000, representing a YoY increase of 3631% and 1779% in 4Q-2021 and 2021, respectively.\n\nGross margin down from 6.8% 4Q-2020 to 3.7% in 4Q-2021, primarily due to the increase in raw material costs; while for the full year of 2021, gross margin expanded to 9.7%, an increase of 250 bps from 2020, mainly driven by the increased quality passing rate of products resulting from the Company's product quality control.\n\nNet income attributable to CBAT shareholders increased to $9.2 million in 4Q-2021, compared to a net loss of $4.3 million in 4Q-2020. For the full year of 2021, GAAP net income was $61.5 million, compared to a net loss of $7.8 million in 2020, primarily driven by change in fair value of warrants liabilities from lower CBAT stock share prices.\n\nBasic and fully-diluted net income per share were both $0.1 in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to a net loss per share of $0.07 in 4Q-2020. Basic and diluted income per share were both $0.70 in 2021, compared to $0.13 in 2020.\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $7.4 million as of December 31, 2021, compared to $2 million as of September 30, 2021, and $11.68 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\n4Q-2021 Business Highlights and Recent Developments\n\nIn November 2021, CBAT completed the acquisition of ~86% majority stake in Zhejiang Hitrans Lithium Battery Technology Co., and had started to consolidate financials since Nov. 25, 2021.\n\nOn December 21, 2021, CBAT subsidiary CBAK New Energy announced that the Company has agreed to develop a customized battery pack with AZAPA R&D China for the Sino-Japan joint venture, which designs and produces electronic control systems and battery and control systems for electric vehicles. Deal terms were not disclosed.\n\nThe battery pack will initially be used for testing low-speed electric vehicles produced by Daihatsu Motor Co., a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp. Meanwhile, CBAK Nanjing will cooperate with AZAPA to jointly explore international markets.

(Nasdaq: ALPP), a leading operator and owner of small market businesses announced today that its subsidiary, ElecJet, has released specifications on third-party testing of its AX Class of Solid-State Batteries. Newest Alpine4 logo (PRNewsfoto\/Alpine 4 Holdings, Inc.)\n\nElecJet, earlier this month, engaged the Battery Innovation Center (BIC) in Newberry, Indiana to have a third-party verification of the specifications of its AX Class of Solid-State Batteries that ElecJet has already confirmed in its laboratory. ElecJet has engaged the BIC to verify the results of the G-AX Class as well, later in 2022. The AX Battery Class is a Ceramic Oxide solid-state battery and comes in the form of a 31Ah Solid-State Battery and a 10Ah Solid-State Battery. All of the AX and G-AX Classes are true solid-state batteries and are not semi solid-state batteries.\n\nElecJet engaged the BIC to perform several types of testing from verification of its charge capabilities to energy density \/ power density, to induced failure point testing.\n\nThe BIC tested two versions of the AX 31Ah. These two subclasses are designed for different market segments.\n\nThe AX-01 is an ultra-safe version that can withstand a variety of survivability use cases. The AX-01 has a slightly different material composition that enables its amazing survivability characteristics. The BIC confirmed that the AX-01 withstood being punctured, then folded, and finally crumpled while still holding a charge. The cell was then put through a temperature destruction test where the cell survived to a temperature of 410 degrees Fahrenheit (210 degrees Celsius). Details of the tests are described below:\n\nThe BIC confirmed that the AX-01 measured a discharge energy of 111.41Wh at a C\/2 rate (measured 31.70 Ah)). At a nominal volume of 0.17571 Liters for each cell and a nominal mass of 0.395 kg, this translates to 634Wh\/L and 282Wh\/kg of energy densities which are both dramatic improvements over current battery technology.\n\nStory continues\n\n* The AX-01 also has a designed commercial cycle life of over 1,200 charge cycles.\n\nThe AX-02 is an energy dense cell that also has a high degree of survivability but trades some of the safety material features of the AX-01 for much higher power densities and higher life cycles. \r\nThe BIC confirmed that the AX-02 has the capability to charge at 4C. This means that the battery can fully charge in just 15 minutes. The AX-02 is also capable of 7C discharging and over 2,400 life cycles, both of which are currently in the process of being confirmed by the BIC.\n\nThe BIC also confirmed that the AX-02 measured a discharge energy of 113.213Wh at a C\/2 rate (measured 31.4 Ah). At a nominal volume of 0.17571 Liters for each cell and a nominal mass of 0.395 kg, this translates to 644Wh\/L and 287Wh\/kg of energy densities which are both dramatic improvements over current battery technology.\n\n*The AX-02 also has a designed commercial cycle life of over 2,400 charge cycles.\n\nKent Wilson, CEO of Alpine 4 had this to say, \"I want to thank the BIC and their talented staff of engineers for their testing work on our AX Class of Solid-State Batteries. While traditional lithium battery cells such as the Tesla 4680 or the Panasonic 21700 have taken lithium-powered cells to new heights, they have reached their technological limits. Further, while other solid-state battery companies have accomplished fast charging like ours, they typically trade-off longevity or how much energy a battery can store. What shareholders and potential customers can take away from the BIC results is that the AX Class of Solid-State Batteries are the perfect balance between energy density (how much energy the battery can store), its C rate (how quickly it can charge) and its cycle count (how many times a battery can be charged). The AX31Ah-02 is the best all-around battery cell in production and ready to transform various industries including the EV and power storage markets. Vehicles from companies like Tesla, Lucid, GM, Ford, and RIVIAN all use traditional lithium cells. If their vehicles were powered by our AX31Ah-02, they could charge in 15 minutes, store more energy for longer duration trips and have battery cells that can power their vehicles for over 300,000 miles before the battery would require replacement. There is no better way to say this than these batteries don't just change the game, they redefine it, and we are hitting the ground running.\"\n\nDanny Marshall, the Battery Innovation Center's Lead Testing and Evaluation Team Engineer, commented: \"I am extremely impressed with the performance of this battery cell relative to other cells that we have tested at BIC. Somehow, its energy density exceeds some of the best NMC technologies that BIC has tested while being solid state and maintaining comparable C-Rate performance. From an EHS testing perspective, it has been shown to maintain stability under some amazing abusive conditions in contrast to the fielded lithium-ion chemistries that we see today. I am excited to continue testing and characterizing the abusive\/performance specifications and see if we can find where the engineering tradeoff will be, assuming it exists.\"\n\n*Tested only in our laboratory still waiting results from the BIC. This process takes several months to complete.\n\nAbout Elecjet: Elecjet specializes in developing super-fast charging, graphene battery solutions that offer convenience in the palm of your hands.

This phenomenon is more important in new industries, and the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing industry is one such area where little-known EV stocks could outperform popular peers once they achieve a surprise target that catapults them into the general public\u2019s eye.\n\nThe most popular EV giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has for a long time attained valuation multiples that boggled fundamentals-driven analysts. The company\u2019s founder Elon Musk commands an international social media following that could make cult leaders envious. Tesla stock attracts over 5,000,000 average monthly searches on the web, and the company had 32 Wall Street analysts issue earnings projections for 2022.\n\nA similar popularity profile applies to Chinese EV play NIO (NYSE:NIO). Nio stock attracts about 3.4 million unique Google searches a month. A total of 25 investment banking analysts provided revenue and earnings projects for NIO\u2019s 2022 financials.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat\u2019s key is that popularity among investors and analysts unlocks stretched valuation multiples when the company\u2019s story is appealing. RivianAutomotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) and the Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) are the other popular EV stocks that have attracted stretched valuations.\n\nIn one investing strategy, investors look for lesser-known stocks with the potential to positively surprise the market. Such stocks could violently surge as new investors pile into them. They do need to have a catalyst that could ignite increased interest. A rapid increase in analyst coverage or search engine traffic are among several such catalysts.\n\n7 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now if You Have $100 to Spend\n\nBelow is my list of three lesser-known electric vehicle stocks that may surprise everyone in the EV race.\n\nSolid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) Arrival (NASDAQ:ARVL) Tritium DCFC (NASDAQ:DCFC)\n\nStory continues\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nLesser-Known EV Stock: Solid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider \/ Shutterstock.com\n\nAn electric vehicle\u2019s battery pack can comprise up to 30% of an EV\u2019s total cost to a customer. There is an ongoing race to engineer the next generation lithium battery pack that solves all the EV industry\u2019s current lithium battery issues, and investors are most familiar with a $7.2 billion valued QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS) stock, a pre-revenue stage developer of high power density solid-state batteries.\n\nAmong the lesser-known solid-state electric-vehicle battery stocks that could take the industry by surprise in the race to build a better battery is Solid Power.\n\nWhile QuantumScape stock attracts 450,000 monthly searches on the web, and the attention of seven investment banking analysts, Solid Power had only two Wall Street analysts provide forecasts for 2022, and SLDP stock is searched just 9,900 times a month on the internet.\n\nSolid Power has spent 10 years researching on and developing a solid-state lithium battery that uses solid sulfide electrolytes to replace the fire-prone gel used in current technology. It targets to offer a 15% \u2013 35% cost advantage over traditional lithium-ion battery pack, 80% more driving range and nearly twice the lifespan of a battery, and faster charging rates, all the while doing away with the flammable liquid gel.\n\nInterestingly, Solid Power has the backing of Ford Mortar Company (NYSE:F), the BMW Group (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) and a partnership with Korean battery manufacturing giant SK Innovation. It has hit some critical development milestones already and could be internally producing 100 Ah Silicon EV battery cells by the end of this year for pilot testing in cars.\n\nSolid Power plans to sell its sulfides at very good margins to the whole battery manufacturing industry once large-scale production starts around 2026. The company\u2019s capital-light strategy will rely on outsourced battery manufacturing.\n\nCould the small company with a $1.5 billion market capitalization change the global electric vehicle market? A pilot project under construction this year will provide better answers, and potentially surprise everyone as the race to develop the best electric vehicle battery unfolds.\n\nArrival (ARVL) An electric vehicle charger is seen next to a row of blue electric buses.\n\nSource: BigPixel Photo \/ Shutterstock.com\n\nLuxemburg-based Arrival is a commercial vehicle manufacturer that plans to start manufacturing electric delivery vans and EV buses this year. The company has a unique strategy for its EV production \u2013 it will build its electric vehicles in capital-light micro-factories constructed closer to its target markets.\n\nArrival is one of the lesser-known electric vehicle stocks with only four Wall Street analysts covering ARVL stock today. Moreover, Arrival stock attracts a mere 590 average web searches a month. Yet short interest has increased to over 25% of available float.\n\nThe investing public has yet to get interested in ARVL stock\u2019s potential to generate life-changing investment returns. But that could change.\n\nArrival\u2019s electric bus is undergoing public road trials with First Bus in the United Kingdom. If successful, the company could break into the Local Authorities market of England and have up to 193 of its new electric buses incorporated into their fleet. This could be the beginning of a long-term customer relationship.\n\nThe company expects to sell and deliver about 400 \u2013 600 commercial vans this year. The United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) is among the first customers to receive van deliveries. Arrival expects to quickly ramp up production to thousands of vans per year from just two small micro-factories.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Arrival\u2019s micro-factories design reduces capital requirements, allows for high flexibility, and boosts margins. All while positioning the company as a competitive OEM that lowers the total cost of ownership of commercial EVs for customers.\n\nThe company also produces components in-house too. Management claimed that non-binding orders doubled during the last quarter of 2021 to around 134,000 vehicles.\n\nArrival might just change the way EV makers must design their business models to generate quick and high returns while deploying the least capital.\n\n7 Recession-Proof Stocks for Nervous Investors to Buy in 2022\n\nArrival\u2019s founder Denis Sverdlov is a Russian national and his firm, Kinetik SARL, owns about 72.8% of ARVL\u2019s stock. \u201cI\u2019m strongly against war or discrimination of any kind,\u201d Denis said during the company\u2019s earnings call on March 2, 2022. The company has not been affected by any international sanctions.\n\nLesser-Known Electric Vehicle Stocks: Tritium (DCFC) Tritium (DCFC) charging, charging station for electric cars, in the parking lot at McDonald's.\n\nSource: Jeppe Gustafsson \/ Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors considering buying into electric vehicle charging infrastructure probably think about ChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT) or a more popular EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) stock. The two electric vehicle charging plays command significant analyst attention and the investing public frequently looks up their stock tickers.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s another EV infrastructure player that currently barely registers on most investor\u2019s radars: Tritium. The company is a global developer and manufacturer of direct current (DC) fast chargers for electric vehicles. It recently went public in January this year and has four financial analysts covering its business. DCFC stock attracts about 480 Google search queries a month and this makes it a lesser-known electric vehicle play.\n\nTritium boasts of over nine years of DC fast-charging experience and has become a preferred supplier of charging equipment to EV charging networks globally. The company has a proven track record of manufacturing reliable charging equipment. So there\u2019s a low business risk here.\n\nDCFC has sold over 6,700 DC fast chargers with a capacity above 50 kilowatts so far and has already closed sales in 41 countries.\n\nTritium has the potential to significantly increase its annual production and sales rate as the EV race accelerates globally. The company is one of the best-placed beneficiaries of the $7.5 billion investment in EV charging allocation from the 2022 Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act.\n\nThe future looks brighter for DCFC stock, yet shares trade well below the pre-SPAC merger price of $10 a share and far below February highs near $20 a share printed when the company won a contract to supply chargers to Wise Power\u2019s subsidiary Wise EV in February 2022.\n\nWise EV is launching a new nationwide charging network. Many more players could come into the EV charging market. Thus, Tritium stands to benefit as its addressable market expands.\n\nThe company will be a charger supplier to anyone joining the global EV charging network race \u2014 and will earn recurring service and maintenance fees, sell spares, and ultimately earn decommissioning fees every 10 years as the charger reaches its end of life.\n\nOn the date of publication, Brian Paradza did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NASDAQ: AQMS) (\"Aqua Metals\" or the \"Company\"), a leading innovator in metals recycling with its AquaRefining\u2122 technology, has achieved another key accomplishment in metals recycling by recovering its first copper from lithium-ion battery black mass at the Company\u2019s Innovation Center in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center. The plating of the high quality copper, which is selectively plated atom-by-atom, is another significant step in building out Aqua Metals\u2019 capabilities for recovering all the high-value materials in lithium-ion batteries. To date, the Company has also produced high-purity lithium hydroxide from lithium-ion battery black mass and successfully lab-tested cobalt plating.\n\nCopper, which currently trades at more than $10,000 a tonne, is an important raw material for manufacturing the copper foil for lithium-ion batteries, and copper also has many other applications relevant to the new energy era. Electric vehicles can contain more than a mile of copper wires, using 4-16 times more copper than gasoline-powered vehicles. Other components of the green energy revolution, such as electric charging points, solar panels, wind turbines, and smart power grids, have heavy copper wire and cabling needs. As of 2021, the world consumed 30 million tonnes of copper per year, and by 2050 it is predicted to double to 60 million tonnes. Efficient and clean recycling methods for recovering copper from spent lithium-ion batteries are critical to meet this global demand.\n\n\u201cTo prove that our AquaRefining technology is the most sustainable and economical method, we are being very thorough in implementing a methodical step-by-step scaling approach as we verify each phase of the process,\u201d said Ben Taecker, Chief Operations and Engineering Officer of Aqua Metals. \u201cWe are very proud of the R&D teams\u2019 progress and are confident that we will remain on schedule for running a fully integrated pilot in the coming months.\u201d\n\nLi AquaRefining recycles spent lithium-ion batteries in a clean, economical way that is fundamentally non-polluting by utilizing the renewable electron as the reagent instead of chemicals or high heat. The room-temperature process uses about 1\/200th of the chemicals of a standard hydro process and does not generate the carbon footprint of a high heat approach. Li AquaRefining is a closed-loop process that recycles the chemicals it uses. Consequently, it has a fraction of the waste streams, estimated at approximately 99.5 percent less than the standard hydro process. Aqua Metals, which to date has been awarded 72 patents with 49 patents pending, is developing its Li AquaRefining process to license to lithium-ion battery recyclers worldwide.\n\n\u201cWhat differentiates us from other metals recycling processes is that our technology produces high purity metals. Cathode materials can be produced from pure metals, and starting with high purity metals is the best approach to making cathode materials,\u201d said David Regan, Vice President of Commercial for Aqua Metals. \u201cWe believe our technology will provide our partners with the ability to recycle more economically and cleanly, and provide a superior business opportunity with the option of selling product back into the battery supply chain or selling high purity metals to the metals industry. We think our partners will find this flexibility a great asset for their business.\u201d\n\nThrough the development of AquaRefining for lead batteries, Aqua Metals is the only company that has experience building a commercial clean metals recycling technology. In addition to lithium and copper, the Company\u2019s R&D program at the Innovation Center is working to recycle the other critical elements of lithium-ion batteries such as cobalt, nickel, and manganese. Aqua Metals will continue to update the market as meaningful progress is made in the R&D process.\n\nAbout Aqua Metals\r\nAqua Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AQMS) is reinventing metals recycling with its patented hydrometallurgical AquaRefining\u2122 technology. The modular Aqualyzers\u2122 cleanly generate ultra-pure metal one atom at a time, closing the sustainability loop for the rapidly growing energy storage economy. The Company\u2019s offerings include equipment supply, services, and licensing of the AquaRefining technology to recyclers across the globe. Aqua Metals is based in Reno, Nevada.\n\nSafe Harbor\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements concerning Aqua Metals, Inc.

(NASDAQ: AQMS) (\"Aqua Metals\" or the \"Company\"), a leading innovator in metals recycling with its AquaRefining\u2122 technology, has achieved a key milestone and potentially an important industry breakthrough by producing its first lithium hydroxide from lithium-ion battery black mass at the Company\u2019s Innovation Center in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center. Currently, the only commercially proven recycling technology being utilized for lithium-ion batteries is smelting which does not recover the lithium. Lithium is a critical component of the lithium-ion batteries that battery manufacturers need to produce to meet the demand of the fast-growing electric vehicle (EV) and overall energy storage markets. In addition to producing lithium through a patent-pending proprietary process, the Company\u2019s R&D program at the Innovation Center is working to recycle the other key elements of lithium-ion batteries such as cobalt (already plated), nickel, copper, and manganese.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step in demonstrating our proprietary Li AquaRefining process, which we think is environmentally and economically superior to other metals recycling methods,\u201d said Ben Taecker, Chief Operations and Engineering Officer of Aqua Metals. \u201cOur goal is to produce battery precursor grade lithium hydroxide, and these early results indicate we are on track for meeting this goal. This also confirms that we remain on schedule to start running our pilot-scale unit in the coming months.\u201d\n\nAs governments and vehicle manufacturers take steps to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles to meet carbon emissions reduction targets, demand for lithium is soaring to the point where lithium shortages are already being forecasted for the near term.\u00a0Benchmark Mineral Intelligence has predicted that there will be acute deficits of lithium as early as this year. The price of lithium has also been dramatically affected, increasing by more than 300 percent in 2021. It currently stands at approximately $58,000 a metric tonne. Increased mining activity alone cannot mitigate the shortages. Mining is environmentally costly and takes five to seven years to get operational; recycling is critical to meet future demand.\n\n\u201cMorningstar, Inc. has predicted that lithium-ion demand will likely outstrip production within the next five years, and demand for lithium will only continue to skyrocket as the world transitions from fossil fuels to a renewable energy economy,\u201d commented David Regan, Aqua Metal\u2019s Vice President of Commercial. \u201cAs of today, the only commercially proven recycling technology for lithium-ion batteries is smelting, which has a negative environmental impact and does not recover the lithium or manganese. Applying the proven AquaRefining process to lithium-ion batteries has the potential to be an important industry breakthrough, as we believe it is the only truly sustainable recycling technology under development that recovers all the valuable metals and compounds without using high heat or consuming massive quantities of chemicals that create difficult to manage waste streams.\u201d\n\nLi AquaRefining recycles spent lithium-ion batteries in a clean, economical way by utilizing the electron as the reagent instead of chemicals or high heat. The emissions-free, room-temperature process uses about one two-hundredth of the chemicals of a standard hydro process and does not generate the carbon footprint of a high heat approach. Li AquaRefining is a closed-loop process that recycles the chemicals it uses. Consequently, it has a fraction of the waste streams, estimated at approximately 99.5 percent less than the standard hydro process.\n\nPhotos accompanying this announcement are available at\n\nLithium Hydroxide produced at the Aqua Metals Innovation Center in Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, NV.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/aff75a67-bbf6-45c2-82f1-05ccbe061a79\n\nThe Lithium hydroxide was produced from black mass made up of a mix of lithium-ion batteries.

Japanese enterprises are in a leading position technologically while China boasts obvious cost advantages in anode materials production because of abundant graphite mineral resources.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2020, China's anode material shipments jumped year by year, hitting 365,000 tons in 2020 with the growth rate exceeding expectations, mainly thanks to the substantial growth in the demand for lithium batteries in various fields around the world. Driven by the demand from new energy vehicles and energy storage batteries, China's production of anode materials is expected to register a high CAGR of 30-35% in upcoming years, and then reach 295 kilotons in 2026.\n\nAt present, the most widely used anode materials are still natural graphite and artificial graphite. From the perspective of product structure, the market share of artificial graphite further increased to 84% in 2020. Affected by the replacement of main domestic cylindrical battery models for shipment and the suspended upgrade of the high nickel system for square power batteries, other anode materials represented by silicon-based anode materials failed to achieve the expected growth with a declining market share. The drop in the proportion of natural graphite was mainly because mainstream battery companies purchased mixed materials of natural and artificial graphite in 2020, which reduced the procurement of pure natural graphite to a certain extent.\n\nThe price of anode materials has kept falling since 2017Q4. On the whole, the price of artificial graphite has dipped slightly faster than that of natural graphite. This trend will be more obvious as the industry's graphite capacity is released substantially. However, by integrating resources and technological advantages, top companies will maintain their profitability and still see considerable growth. Currently, the coke price tends to go down, which will help anode material companies reduce the cost of raw materials to offset the pressure brought by the price drop.\n\nFrom the perspective of market competition, the combined market share of TOP 3 companies in China's anode material market decreased from 57% in 2019 to 53% in 2020, marking a lower concentration in the anode material market, because the demand for various anode materials in the second half of the year was huge, but the capacity of top enterprises was insufficient, which pushed up the capacity utilization rate of the second- and third- echelon companies to swell. In addition, companies engaged in low-power communication energy storage lithium batteries and the like with low performance requirements and high price sensitivity preferred to purchase from the second- and third- echelon anode material companies.\n\nThe industry presents a pattern of `three big companies and three small companies`. The first echelon includes three major companies: the natural graphite leader Shenzhen BTR New Energy Materials, the artificial graphite tycoon Shanghai Shanshan Technology and the high-end artificial anode material giant Jiangxi Zichen Technology, of which the latter two pose duopoly in the artificial graphite market, closely followed by Shenzhen BTR New Energy Materials with high-quality customers.\n\nEach of them shipped more than 40,000 tons of anode materials in 2019. The second echelon consists of three small companies --- Hunan Shinzoom Technology, Dongguan Kaijin, and Shenzhen XFH Technology, with the respective shipments of over 10,000 tons in 2019. Although Dongguan Kaijin ranks among the top three by shipments, it still falls into the second echelon due to its heavy reliance on a single major customer and low-end products.\n\nThe capacity of Shenzhen BTR New Energy Materials, Shanshan Technology, Jiangxi Zichen Technology, and Dongguan Kaijin totaled 490,000 tons in 2020 when the industry's output hit 365,000 tons. In 2021, the penetration rate of new energy vehicles soars, and major anode material companies plan to expand production by over 1 million tons.\n\nAmong them, Shenzhen BTR New Energy Materials will add 270,000 tons, Shanshan Technology 260,000 tons, Jiangxi Zichen Technology and Dongguan Kaijin 200,000 tons each. Sufficient capacity can meet the fast-growing demand.\n\nThe report highlights the following:\n\nMarket size and forecast, competitive landscape, new anode materials development, etc. of global lithium-ion battery anode materials industry;Policies, market size and forecast, competitive landscape, price trend, etc. of China's lithium-ion battery anode materials industry;Market size, competitive landscape, imports & exports, price trend, etc. of global and China's raw material industries (graphite, silicon carbide, lithium titanate, graphene, etc.) of anode materials;Market size, competitive landscape, analysis and forecast for the demand for anode materials, etc. of global and China's lithium battery industries;Profile, anode materials business, operation, etc. of 25 global and Chinese anode materials manufacturers;Profile, lithium titanate materials business, operation, etc. of 3 global and Chinese lithium titanate materials producers.\n\nKey Topics Covered:\r\n\r\n1.

Source: Minviro\n\nGWP Impact of LiOH produced from Cinovec PFS (2019), the theoretical Cinovec Decarbonised Case, for Chilean Brine, Australian Spodumene converted in China and US Sedimentary Clay. Source: Minviro\n\nCEZ to Provide Green Power to Project\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nCinovec\u2019s Global Warming Potential has been modelled using ISO-compliant LCA by consultancy Minviro Ltd, providing clear resolution of the drivers of the project\u2019s emissions.  GWP Impact Mitigation Scenarios identified for the Cinovec Project, potentially including solar power, electric mining fleet, Hypex Bio explosives and use of green hydrogen for thermal energy (Cinovec Decarbonised Case) which could make Cinovec\u2019s lithium chemicals have some of the lowest CO2 intensity in the world if all impact mitigation strategies are pursued.  CEZ plans to provide 100% renewable energy to power the mine, the Front-End Comminution and Beneficiation (FECAB) and Lithium Chemical Plants (LCP)  LCA also assessed Acidification Potential (AP), Water Use and Land Use (per ISO standards).\n\nAP is comparable to Chilean Brine but only 13% of the equivalent for Australian spodumene processed in China.  Cinovec Water Use projected to be lower than all benchmarks and <5% of Chilean Brine Water Use even when water evaporated from the brine is not included in the water use calculation.\n\nPERTH, Australia, Jan. 24, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- European Metals Holdings Limited (\u201cEMH\u201d, or \u201cthe Company\u201d) (ASX & AIM: EMH, OTC \u2013 Nasdaq Intl ADS: EMHXY) is pleased to provide an update in relation to the outcomes of the Life Cycle Assessment conducted by Minviro in relation to lithium battery chemicals production from the Cinovec mine.\n\nKeith Coughlan, Executive Chairman, said \u201cWe are extremely pleased that the Minviro LCA has confirmed what we have believed to be the case for a long time \u2013 Cinovec has the potential to have the lowest overall environmental impacts compared to other conventional lithium battery metals projects not only in Europe but also on a global basis. With the use of solar power and other optimisations the Cinovec Project will set a standard by which all other conventional lithium producers could be judged. We expect the environmental credentials of the Cinovec Project will help make its product valuable to end users, particularly in light of the new EU requirements in relation to greenhouse emissions. Not only does the optimised model demonstrate very low CO2 emissions, the Project also delivers excellent results with regards to acidification and water consumption. As Cinovec is an historic underground mine with minimal social and environmental impacts, the entire ESG credentials of the Project are very strong.\n\nStory continues\n\nMINE, FECAB AND LCP TO BE POWERED BY SOLAR POWER PLANT\n\nCEZ, EMH\u2019s joint venture partner in the Cinovec Lithium Project, plans to provide 100% renewable energy to power the mine, the Front-End Comminution and Beneficiation (FECAB) And Lithium Chemical Plants (LCP). CEZ currently owns renewables installations with aggregate power generation capacity of 1720 MW. This capacity will increase by 1500 MW by 2025.\n\nThe renewable energy sources will be capable of providing all the required power for all aspects of the Cinovec Project including the mine, the FECAB plant as well as the Lithium Chemical Plant under normal operating conditions. The Company is also considering the use of electric mining equipment to further reduce the CO2 footprint at Cinovec.\n\nCINOVEC LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\n\nAs previously announced, Minviro (a UK-based and globally recognised sustainability and life cycle assessment consultancy) was engaged to conduct a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for the Cinovec Project\u2019s proposed lithium battery-grade chemicals, Lithium Carbonate (Li2CO3) and Lithium Hydroxide Monohydrate (LiOH) (refer to the Company\u2019s ASX release dated 10 June 2021). The LCA was completed at the end of 3Q21 and the full results underwent independent external QA\/QC peer review, including ISO compliance review, before finalisation.\n\nMinviro also assessed GWP reduction strategies being advanced by Geomet management (as part of the ongoing Definitive Feasibility Study) to reduce the carbon footprint of Cinovec, including full electrification of the mine and mining vehicle fleet; sourcing all electrical power for both the mine and lithium processing plant from a proposed co-developed photovoltaic cell array adjacent to the Cinovec processing plant; and green hydrogen as replacement for conventional gas in the ore roasting process (Decarbonization Case).\n\nThe LCA was conducted according to the requirements of the ISO-14040:2006 and ISO-14044:2006, including a third-party review from LCA experts to ensure that the LCA study is scientifically robust.\n\nResults of the Life Cycle Assessment\n\nLiOH Production\n\nLiOH products can have different environmental impacts depending on the natural resource they are produced from and the process technology chosen in flowsheets. A comparison of how the C\u00ednovec LiOH product will compare to existing process pathways is shown below in Figure 1.\n\nFor all five production routes shown in Figure 1 the chemical processing is the largest driver of the impact. Transport is minimal for all routes except for the Australian spodumene route, where the spodumene concentrate is transported to China; and the LiOH product from all production routes is transported 400 km from the Port of Rotterdam to provide the GWP impacts as delivered at the same end-users.\n\nFigure 1 is available at https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/9e7617d9-a206-439a-b1cd-3af29a15145c\n\nFULL ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nhttps:\/\/www.investi.com.au\/api\/announcements\/emh\/7b59ad15-7be.pdf\n\nCONTACT \r\nFor further information on this update or the Company generally, please visit our website at www.europeanmet.com.\n\nENQUIRIES:\n\nEuropean Metals Holdings Limited Keith Coughlan, Executive Chairman  Tel: +61 (0) 419 996 333\r\nEmail: keith@europeanmet.com  Kiran Morzaria, Non-Executive Director Tel: +44 (0) 20 7440 0647 Dennis Wilkins, Company Secretary Tel: +61 (0) 417 945 049\r\nEmail: dennis@europeanmet.com","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/lca-quantifies-cinovec-lithium-chemical-170000186.html","symbols":["E86.F","E86.STU","E861.F","EMH.AU","EMH.LSE","EMHLF.US","EMHXY.US","ERPNF.US"],"tags":["CEZ","CHEMICAL PLANTS","CINOVEC DECARBONISED CASE","CINOVEC PFS","CINOVEC PROJECT","EUROPEAN METALS HOLDINGS LIMITED","LCA","LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT","LITHIUM BATTERY","LITHIUM CHEMICAL PLANT","SOLAR POWER","THE PROJECT"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.995,"neg":0.016,"neu":0.908,"pos":0.076}},{"date":"2022-01-17T21:00:00+00:00","title":"Top 10 Lithium Stocks in LIT, the World's First Lithium ETF","content":"The Lithium & Battery Tech ETF's two largest holdings are miner Albemarle and Tesla, while a Warren Buffet-owned stock ranks No. 6.","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/m\/272c2e00-7902-32c5-9627-ede6f2997661\/top-10-lithium-stocks-in-lit%2C.html","symbols":["GSPC.INDX","LAC.TO","LAC.US","TL0.F","TL0.XETRA","TSLA.MX","TSLA.US","TSLA34.SA","WUC1.F"],"tags":["CHINA","LITHIUM BATTERIES","LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES","STOCK HOLDINGS"],"sentiment":{"polarity":-0.296,"neg":0.104,"neu":0.896,"pos":0}},{"date":"2022-01-13T21:15:00+00:00","title":"Albemarle and 6K Sign Joint Development Agreement to Develop Novel Lithium Battery Materials","content":"Albemarle to invest in 6K and sponsor development of UniMelt\u00ae system for advanced, sustainable materials production\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. and NORTH ANDOVER, Mass., Jan. 13, 2022 \/PRNewswire\/ -- Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB), a global leader in advanced lithium materials, and 6K, an emerging leader of microwave-controlled plasma technology, today announced they have signed a joint development agreement (JDA) to explore the use of 6K's patented UniMelt\u00ae advanced, sustainable materials production platform to develop novel lithium battery materials through potentially disruptive manufacturing processes.
