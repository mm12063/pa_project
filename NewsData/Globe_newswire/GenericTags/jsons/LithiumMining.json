Lithium stocks.\n\nSource: tunasalmon \/ Shutterstock\n\nLithium demand has soared over the past few years with the surging popularity of electric vehicles (EVs). Multiple market studies suggest that the industry will grow at an incredible pace over the next ten years. Hence, lithium stocks can potentially be lucrative investments down the line.\n\nLithium stocks have been performing well for the better parts of the past couple of years. A lot has to do with the mind-boggling growth in EV sales. In 2021, EV sales volume shot up to 6.7 million units, representing a 108% bump from 2020. By 2030, demand for lithium will rise to two million metric tons.\n\nLithium prices are rising aggressively as supply has failed to keep up with ballooning demand. Therefore, lithium-producing firms are in for some enticing price realization in the foreseeable future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for May With Yields Over 6%\n\nHere are three lithium stocks to invest in this month:\n\nLAC Lithium Americas Corp. $24.56 LTHM Livent Corporation $28.03 ALB Albemarle Corporation $242.50\n\nLithium Stocks: Lithium Americas (LAC) Lithium Americas logo on a phone screen in front of a computer showing their website. LAC stock.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators \/ Shutterstock\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is a lithium mining start-up with plenty of potential to profit from booming lithium demand. Moreover, with producer nations looking to foster a domestic production base, the company can benefit immensely from the trend.\n\nThe Canadian lithium miner has a couple of major lithium projects that could bring in the big bucks in the coming years.

Moreover, it has also acquired one of its peers in Millennial Lithium, with major lithium mining assets in Argentina.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, LAC is working on another exciting project in Nevada called Thacker Pass. According to the company, it is the largest known lithium resource in the U.S. However, it has been the subject of controversy, but it could be a massive money-spinner for LAC stock if it gets through the legal hurdles.\n\nLivent Corporation (LTHM) Livent Corporation logo on a phone screen. LTHM stock.\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold \/ Shutterstock\n\nLivent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) is one of the top integrated pure-play lithium producers. It sells lithium compounds to EV original equipment manufacturers and leading battery makers across the globe. International diversity has been one of its key differentiators, which gives it access to multiple manufacturers. It produces lithium with the lowest-cost resources, giving it a major competitive advantage. Livent currently has over 20,000 metric tons production capacity, which could double by the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe firm has been extracting lithium from Salar del Hombre Muerto in Argentina for the past two decades. It also produces qualified battery-grade lithium in the U.S. and China and is on track for capacity expansions.\n\n7 Restaurant Stocks Ready for a 'Revenge Travel' Rally\n\nMoreover, the financials are rock solid for the business, with revenues above 45% in the past year. Additionally, its EBITDA growth was at a spectacular 365% for the year. With the rising lithium demand and stronger margins, the business is in for another robust showing this year and beyond.\n\nLithium Stocks: Albemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov\/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) is a specialty chemicals producer that aims to expand its lithium business rapidly. It\u2019s not a sector pure-play, but its lithium segment now accounts for 41% of total revenues and over 50% of its adjusted EBITDA. Last year, its lithium business grew at 19% compared to just 6% of total revenue growth. Albemarle\u2019s lithium business will become a major growth catalyst, with the industry expected to grow extensively over the next few years.\n\nThe company has been investing heavily in acquiring lithium mining and converting properties in recent years. For instance, it acquired lithium converting giant Guangxi Tianyuan Corporation, strengthening its position in China. Moreover, Albermarle has a 49% stake in the Greenbushes mine, producing more than 60,000 metric tons every year.\n\nIn terms of financials, the firm has been knocking it out of the park. Its top- and bottom-line performance last year tracked well over its five-year averages. Additionally, it has been a dividend aristocrat, boasting 28 consecutive years of growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(OTC Pink:\"STAL\") is pleased to announce that it signed a Binding Letter of Intent to acquire a majority interest in NSM USA, a Wyoming Corporation that owns four lithium mining sites in Africa. Currently these mines are in the exploration stage with exploration results showing significant reserves. STAL will pay $2,000,000 for the majority stake which will be used by NSM USA to develop and commence mining operations at the four properties.\n\nRichard Carey, Chairman of STAL, commented, \"This is the next step in the evolution of STAL. We continue to look for mining operations to acquire, while also seeking technologies that more efficiently process the minerals extracted, providing better yields at lower costs.\"\n\nWeverson Correia, CEO of STAL stated, \"The world has a huge appetite for Lithium. As a result, the expected reserves of these four mines would hold significant value. As we develop the properties, and commence mining operations, we will regularly provide updated information to our shareholders.\"\n\nAbout Star Alliance International Corp.\n\nStar Alliance International Corp. (\"the Company\", or \"STAL\") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 17, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada.\n\nIn August 2019, following a change in control, STAL acquired the mining claims, buildings and equipment from Troy Mining Corporation. The Project is located at the base of the \"gold mother lode\" in one of the three major vein belts where the greatest concentration of minerals settled, over the years, in California. Now the final for these assets has been made.\n\nOur gold estimates have been confirmed by geologists showing significant reserves of gold located in veins within the areas that are covered by our California mining leases.\n\nSTAL plans to commence mining as soon as it is possible.\n\nIn December 2021 STAL executed the agreements to acquire 51% of Compania Minera Metalurgica Centro Americana SA (Commsa), a Honduran Corporation. Commsa owns the mining rights to five mines, one approved for mining and 4 approved for exploration. These mines that have significant gold resources run along a 12.5 mile stretch of the Rio Jalan River. We will commence mining operations very shortly and the Company plans to expand operations as soon as possible.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn November, 2021, STAL entered into a binding Letter of Intent to acquire 49% of Lions Works Advertising, SA, a Guatemala Corporation that owns the \"Genesis\" ore extraction process. Since signing the Letter of Intent the company has renegotiated and will now acquire a 51% interest. This green, environmentally friendly process, extracts up to 98% of the gold ore from the rock. A single module processes 300 to 350 tons of ore daily. The speed of extraction is up to 400 times faster than a conventional heap leaching process.\n\nThe Company plans to market \"Genesis\" to mining companies worldwide.\n\nSafe Harbor and Informational Statement\n\nThis press release may contain forward-looking information within the meaning of Section 21E of the Security Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), including all statements that are not statement of historical fact regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the company, its directors or its officers with respect to, among other things: (i) the company's financing plans; (ii) trends affecting the company's financial conditions or results of operations; (iii): the company's growth strategy and operating strategy; and (iv) the declaration and payment of dividends.\n\nThe words \"may\", \"would\", \"will\", \"expect\", \"estimate\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"intend\", and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

All projects are in the mineral-rich, politically stable, and mining-friendly country of Argentina. Marifil offers strong potential for value appreciation in the near, medium and long term.\n\nHombre Muerto lies within the Puna Region of Argentina, which comprises some 30 salars (salt flats) with good potential to host lithium mineralization. Marifil Mines' properties all lie within this famous lithium region within the new, developing Carachi Pampa lithium basin.\n\nMarifil Mines collected brine samples from shallow pits throughout this basin, obtaining preliminary indications of the presence of lithium. The highest lithium values reported by Marifil's exploration team were 171 ppm Li (parts per million) and 261 ppm Li. These are very encouraging initial sample results showing that further exploration work is required.\n\nMarifil Mines has extensive lithium exploration work planned in 2019.

Tim McCutcheon, President of Wealth Minerals, talked with Stock Day\u2019s Everett Jolly about recent news impacting this industry.\n\nWealth Minerals has interests in Canada, Mexico, Peru and most recently, Chile. Their latest project, the Atacama Project, is part of the prolific Atacama Salar region, which accounts for one third of the world\u2019s production of lithium.\n\n\u201cWe set up this platform (Wealth Minerals) to get into the space, a first mover in Chile,\u201d says McCutcheon. \u201cChile is\u00a0 a premiere location for the production of lithium from brines.\u201d However, he went on to say, the news for the lithium sector as a whole hasn\u2019t all been promising.\n\n\u201cThe lithium space in general has taken a pretty big hit since the beginning of the year, and Wealth has followed its peer group down to lower valuation levels. No one in the company is happy about that.\u201d\n\nMcCutcheon, however, tells Jolly it\u2019s important to keep perspective on the numbers. Jolly did mention that minerals are down in general. Then McCutcheon noted that the decline in all lithium peer companies by nearly the same percentage amount since January is likely a sector-wide issue not a company specific issue. However, that could change in a heartbeat.\n\n\u201cConsumers of lithium, meaning mainly the auto companies and the battery manufacturers, are woefully unprepared for the supply crunch that is looming on the horizon, explains McCutcheon. He added, \u201clithium is a small market and consumed in long term contracts. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of volume to move that price all over the place.\u201d\n\nFor more on the outlook of lithium and Wealth Minerals listen to the entire podcast here: https:\/\/upticknewswire.com\/featured-interview-president-tim-mccutcheon-of-wealth-minerals-ltd-otcqb-wmllf-4\/\n\nAbout Wealth Minerals\n\nWealth Minerals is a mineral resource company with interests in Canada, Mexico, Peru and Chile. The Company\u2019s main focus is the acquisition of lithium projects in South America. To date, the Company has positioned itself to develop the Trinity Project, as well as to work alongside existing producers in the prolific Atacama Salar, in addition to the Laguna Verde lithium project acquisition. The Company has also positioned itself to play a role in asset consolidation in Chile with the Five Salars Project.\n\nThe Company is transitioning from an asset acquisition phase to developing its current high potential portfolio. Lithium market dynamics and a rapidly increasing metal price are the result of profound structural issues with the industry meeting anticipated future demand. Wealth Minerals is positioning itself to be a major beneficiary of this future mismatch of supply and demand. The Company also maintains and continues to evaluate a portfolio of precious and base metal exploration-stage projects\n\nFor More Information: www.wealthminerals.com\n\nAbout Tim McCutcheon\n\nMr. McCutcheon is a mining and finance professional with over 20 years of international business experience.

(TSXV:WML) (OTCQX:WMLLF) (SSE:WMLCL) (Frankfurt.EJZN) (the \u201cCompany\u201d) Returns to Discuss Company Updates with Everett Jolly on Uptick Newswire\u2019s \u201cStock Day\u201d Podcast.\n\nReturning to the show for the first time in several months, Everett Jolly welcomed President of Wealth Minerals, Ltd., Tim McCutcheon. \u201cWelcome to the show! Why don\u2019t you give my listeners a statement about who you are and what you\u2019re all about.\u201d\n\nOver the past two years, Wealth Minerals, Ltd., has put together a portfolio of premier lithium assets in Chile, a country which represents one-third of the global production of lithium. It comes from one geological unit called the \u201cAtacama Salar.\u201d They\u2019re the second largest player after Australia, but he said, \u201cIt has huge endowments from Mother Nature and a lot of scope for ramping up production. There\u2019s a new president in Chile that came in earlier this year and he\u2019s made it explicitly part of his election platform to ramp up natural resources and to really have Chile play a much bigger role in the global lithium market.\u201d Wealth Minerals put together this portfolio in Chile in anticipation of the government eventually becoming \u201cthe Saudi Arabia of lithium production.\u201d\n\nJolly mentioned that in the last couple of months, the Company had a non-brokered raise of $5\u00a0million. He wanted to how they are planning to use those funds.\n\nMcCutcheon replied that the money is going toward building the effort on the ground and the phase of acquiring assets in the lithium space is over. He said the Company believes there is a major paradigm shift in the world in how lithium is used, consumed and understood by global energy markets. By being a first mover in Chile, Wealth Minerals has basically vacuumed up everything they could at a reasonable price and then have been sorting it into the assets that they really want to keep.\n\nHe indicated that the Company did have a recent hiccup in drilling that was made public. They just need to reach out to the local community because it will be a long-term relationship, so the Company needs to understand local concerns. Wealth Minerals wants to emphasize to local inhabitants that the opportunity to create jobs, income and tax revenue is tremendous.\n\nJolly asked, \u201cWhat is the state of the global lithium market as you see it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, right now, the global lithium market is in deficit and there\u2019s a real disconnect between consumers of lithium and suppliers of lithium.\u201d McCutcheon continued by noting that, in terms of making an electric car, lithium is a very small cost component. The key is that you cannot make an electric car without lithium. \u201cSo, even though it\u2019s small in dollar terms, it\u2019s incredibly strategic in terms of actually being able to do it.\u201d\n\nHe continued that the consumers of lithium are multi-billion-dollar companies who are building massive battery factories, assembly lines, and so on. What these companies haven\u2019t figured out, however, is where the lithium is coming from. \u201cSo, the pipeline of projects globally doesn\u2019t really fit what the demand curve suggests going forward.\u201d\n\nJolly said he thinks the Company is currently undervalued. In closing, he asked McCutcheon his thoughts about wealth and capital markets.\n\nThe lithium market is in a liquidity dynamic, i.e., money in and money out. Across the board, the lithium market has been hit hard recently, but the underlying dynamic is very much still there. The fundamentals are really solid.\n\nFor more information about the Company\u2019s financial details, listen to the full interview at the link below.\n\nhttps:\/\/upticknewswire.com\/featured-interview-president-tim-mccutcheon-of-wealth-minerals-ltd-otcqb-wmllf-3\/\n\nAbout WMLLF\r\nWealth Minerals, Ltd., is a mineral resource company with a strong focus on lithium brines in Chile and on the acquisition of additional lithium assets in South America.

He described LiCo Energy Metals Inc. as a Canadian mineral exploration company with a focus on two energy metals \u2013 lithium and cobalt. \u201cWe believe strongly in the future of these two commodities, and what we\u2019ve done is put different land packagestogether for the exploration of these two metals in world class locations,\u201d said Mr. Fernback. Their exploration sites span an international range, with multiple locations in Canada, the United States, and Chile, and the company continues to expand with the recent purchase of the Ontario Glencore Bucke Cobalt Property in its entirety.\n\nLiCo\u2019s 2017 drilling results met the internal goals set of the management team. The Company completed over 4,000 meters of drilling across all of their Ontario cobaltproperties, and had cobalt mineralization in every drill core.\u00a0 The Company encourages everyone to view the results in the news released on LiCo\u2019s website (https:\/\/licoenergymetals.com\/press\/).\u00a0 The Company has summarized its drill core results in its news releases dated January 26, 2018 and March 8, 2018. \u00a0\u201cWe had consistent showings of 0.5% + cobalt in many of our drill cores assayed, and we\u2019re really happy about the drilling results in Ontario.\u201d These accomplishments have driven the Company forward, and their plans for 2018 are to continue expanding their exploration programs on the Teledyne and Glencore Bucke sites. The plan is to run a two-phase drilling program across 2018 and 2019 for each of the properties, with the goal of reaching 5,000 meters of drilling in phase one and another 6,000 meters or more in phase 2.\n\nMr. Fernback also provided some more information about the company\u2019s Nevada and Chile properties. The plan is to continue their currently implemented programs in order to thoroughly investigate each site for the potentially large lithium deposits, all the while working closely with the local communities to ensure successful solutions to future endeavors on the properties. LiCo management is confident that these efforts will assist it in the long-term.\n\nMr. Fernback is feeling optimistic about the Company\u2019s future endeavors, and encourages people interested in the green energy space to get involved and due their due diligence on LiCo. \u201cThe future is bright for cobalt and lithium\u2026 We are looking to build up the Ontario Cobalt project, which is very promising.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about LiCo\u2019s ongoing projects, the newest members of their board of directors, and plans for the future, check out the full interview at the link address below: https:\/\/upticknewswire.com\/featured-interview-ceo-tim-fernback-of-lico-energy-metals-inc-otcqb-wctxf-3\/\n\nAbout LiCo Energy Metals: https:\/\/licoenergymetals.com\/\r\nLiCo Energy Metals Inc., a Canadian exploration stage company, engages in the acquisition, exploration, and development of metals used in the production of lithium-ion batteries.

The latest vat leach testwork has shown that over 90% of the lithium and boron was extracted into solution in less than seven days. The significant decrease in leach time, acid consumption and solution requirements are expected to result in lower capital and operating costs than previously envisaged.\n\nGlobal Geoscience\u2019s Managing Director, Bernard Rowe commented:\n\n\u201cThe latest vat leach results represent a significant improvement on already favourable acid-leach results and clearly demonstrate the advantages that vat leaching offers.\n\n\u201cThe rapid leach times, lower acid consumption and lower solution requirements are expected to have a very positive impact on both capital and operating cost estimates.\n\n\u201cThe results bode well for the soon to be released trade-off studies being undertaken as Phase 1 of the Rhyolite Ridge Pre-Feasibility Study.\n\n\u201cSulphuric acid will be the largest reagent cost and reducing acid consumption will have a very positive impact on operating costs.\n\n\u201cVat leaching allows for much greater control of the leaching processing resulting in faster, more efficient and targeted leaching when compared to heap leaching.\n\n\u201cWith a vat leach, we can control temperature, acidity (pH) and solution flow rates and this provides significant advantages over heap leaching.\u00a0 This control allows a more selective leach which recovers the lithium and boron, however, does not leach as many of the other elements into solution.\n\n\u201cLower levels of other elements in the PLS has the benefit of simplifying the crystallisation and purification process steps. On-going metallurgical testwork is concurrently evaluating various attractive options to produce lithium carbonate and boric acid on site.\u201d\n\nVat Leach vs Heap Leach Comparative Information\n\nOngoing metallurgical testwork conducted by Kappes Cassiday (Reno) has further demonstrated that simple, low-cost acid leach processes can be used to extract lithium and boron at high recovery rates into a Pregnant Leach Solution (\u201cPLS\u201d).\u00a0 Lithium and boron can then be removed from the PLS through a combination of mechanical evaporation, crystallisation and purification steps to produce lithium carbonate and boric acid at the mine site.\n\nThe table below compares the key results announced today (Vat 3 and Vat 4) against previously announced Heap Leach and initial Vat Leach results.\n\nPreviously Announced Results  New Results  Heap Leach\r\nColumn 2Heap Leach\r\nColumn 4Vat Leach\r\nVat 1Vat Leach\r\nVat 3Vat Leach\r\nVat 4Crush-150mm-38mm-150mm-25mm-25mmLithium Recovery to PLS90%97%92%>90%>90%Boron Recovery to PLS88%98%80%>90%>90%Leach Time41 days15 days39 days<10 days<7 daysAcid Leach Solution10%10%15%pH controlledpH controlled Acid Consumption\r\n (kg\/t of ore)413485446380435\n\nColumn and Vat Leach Testwork\n\nTestwork was conducted on samples collected from outcrop (424750E, 4185750N NAD27 Z11) within the Rhyolite Ridge Mineral Resource. The samples are considered to be representative of the high-grade lithium-boron mineralisation across the Resource.\n\nThe Company announced the results of column and vat leach testwork on 12 December 2017 and on 21 February 2018.\n\nThe vat leach testwork results announced today are for:\n\nVat 3 test comprising 100kg sample crushed to minus 25mm and leached with solution that is pH and free acid controlled at low upward bed\u00a0 flow rates through the vatVat 4 test comprising 100kg sample crushed to minus 25mm and leached with solution that is pH and free acid controlled at moderate upward bed\u00a0 flow rates through the vat \u00a0and at initially higher acid concentration\u00a0 and slightly higher water to feed ratio\n\nVat leaching allows for much greater control of the leaching process by regulating acidity (pH), temperature and solution flow rates.\u00a0 In tests Vat 3 and Vat 4, crushed sample was loaded into a 56cm diameter heated plastic barrel (vat).\u00a0 The barrel was then flooded with solution comprising a mix of sulphuric acid and water.\u00a0 Additional acid was added to maintain the pH.\n\nThe table below compares the heap leach Column 4 tests and vat leach tests.\n\nHeap Leach\r\nColumn 4Vat Leach\r\nVat 1Vat Leach\r\nVat 3Vat Leach\r\nVat 4Sample Size (kg)58150100100Sample Head Grade1,280 ppm Li\r\n2.12% B1,303 ppm Li\r\n2.14% B1,103 ppm Li\r\n2.41%1,103 ppm Li\r\n2.41%Crush-38mm-150mm-25mm-25mmLithium Recovery %9792>90>90Boron Recovery %9880>90>90Leach Time15 days39 days<10 days<7 daysAcid Pre-Treatment5%15%nonoAcid Leach Solution10%15%pH controlledpH controlledAcid Consumption\r\n (kg\/t of feed)485446380435\n\nThe charts below show lithium and boron recoveries and acid consumption on a daily basis for Vat 3 and Vat 4:\r\nhttp:\/\/resource.globenewswire.com\/Resource\/Download\/e3ff8e99-eec5-4c37-bb2b-77dad1b95306http:\/\/resource.globenewswire.com\/Resource\/Download\/e9cafb31-ad0e-4d1c-b95b-d1d9c9a3a1b1\n\nBackground Information\n\nIn January 2018, Global appointed Amec Foster Wheeler (part of Wood plc) as the engineering and design firm to complete the Rhyolite Ridge Pre-Feasibility Study (\u201cPFS\u201d). The high-grade lithium-boron mineralisation is the focus of the Rhyolite Ridge PFS as it represents potentially the highest value material combined with a low-cost, simple processing route.\u00a0 This is due to the low-clay, low-carbonate and high-searlesite (boron) content of the rock, which make the mineralisation amenable to low-cost acid leaching at ambient temperature and pressure. The proposed flowsheet will allow for the production of lithium carbonate and boric acid at the mine site.\n\nSince the Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mineralisation responds extremely well to acid leaching, Amec Foster Wheeler is currently evaluating various processing flowsheets to determine the best route to proceed with in the PFS. The processing routes being evaluated include agitation (tank) leaching, vat leaching and heap leaching.\u00a0 On-going metallurgical testwork is analysing various options for the crystallisation and purification process steps.\n\nContacts at Global Geoscience\n\nBernard RoweJames D.

Global Geoscience Limited (\u201cGlobal\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (ASX:GSC) today announced that the initial mining study confirms that the large, shallow Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron deposit in Nevada, USA is amenable to low-cost open pit mining at rates of 2 to 4 million tonnes per annum (\u201cMtpa\u201d).\n\nWhilst no decision has been made at this stage, the Company is considering production rates in the range of 2 million to 4 million tonnes per annum.\u00a0 By way of illustration, one million tonnes of mineralisation contains approximately 8,700 tonnes of lithium carbonate and 77,200 tonnes of boric acid.\n\nGlobal Geoscience\u2019s Managing Director, Bernard Rowe said: \u201cThe initial mining study has shown that the Rhyolite Ridge Resource can readily support a 2Mtpa to 4Mtpa mining operation based solely on the current high-grade lithium-boron Resource at South Basin.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are examining an initial starter pit based on a 26Mt pit shell (constrained) that we expect will allow us to stay under the one square mile footprint required to be considered for fast-track permitting under US Federal Government regulations.\u00a0 The initial development could be followed by a much larger development based on the 87Mt pit shell (unconstrained) that would allow an increased production rate of 4Mtpa and above.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that mining study has only examined mining parameters and any implied cost estimates only relate to mining and specifically exclude processing and refining costs.\u00a0 In that respect, the mining study is only examining the parameters to mine and supply feed to the processing plant.\n\nThe mining study considered two scenarios:\n\n\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0A smaller constrained starter pit shell:\n\n26 million tonnes at 1,400ppm lithium (equivalent to 0.74% lithium carbonate) and 1.24% boron (equivalent to 7.1% boric acid)Supporting a 2Mtpa operation for more than 10 yearsLow strip ratio of less than 4:1Small footprint that may be eligible for fast-track permitting\n\n\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0A larger unconstrained pit shell:\n\n87 million tonnes at 1,635ppm lithium (equivalent to 0.87% lithium carbonate) and 1.35% boron (equivalent to 7.7% boric acid)Supporting a 4Mtpa operation for more than 20 years\n\nA summary of key pit shells is shown in the table below.\n\nTable 1:\n\nPit Shell22\r\n

planned to be produced at the Rhyolite Ridge mine site and are included in the above table to illustrate the scale of the project. The contained lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) is derived by multiplying the mined lithium grade (ppm) by 5.32. The contained boric acid (H3BO3) is derived by multiplying the mined boron grade (%) by 5.72.\n\nMining Study\n\nGlobal Geoscience engaged RPM Global (\u201cRPM\u201d) (formerly Runge) to conduct an initial mining study (strategic analysis) of the Rhyolite Ridge Lithium-Boron Project.\u00a0 The study included pit limit optimisation using Whittle 4X and developing a conceptual mine site layout.\u00a0 Further work to be completed includes pit design and scheduling. Mining cost estimates were provided by RPM.\n\nMining projects in Nevada with a disturbance footprint (mine, plant, dumps and other infrastructure) of less than one square mile may be considered for expedited approval and permitting. The Company requested RPM to constrain a pit in a manner to provide adequate tonnage (>20Mt) and mine life (10 years) with the smallest possible footprint (surface area).\n\nTwo main scenarios were examined in the study:\n\n1)\u00a0 small constrained pit at the northern end of the Resource that could be considered for fast-track permitting if the total mine footprint is under one square mile; and\u00a0\r\n 2)\u00a0 large, unconstrained pit mining most of the high-grade lithium-boron Indicated Resource.\n\nThe key inputs to the RPM mining study were:\n\nRhyolite Ridge Mineral Resource announced 31 October 2017Marginal cut-off grade of 1,050ppm Li and 0.5% boronOpen pit slope angles of 45 degreesMining dilution of 5% (at zero grade) and loss of 5%Mining rate of 2Mtpa of lithium-boron mineralization\n\nRPM provided an estimate of mining costs for the project of US$2.81\/tonne of waste and US$3.26\/tonne of mineralisation.\n\nThe selected pit shells target the high-grade lithium-boron mineralisation in the Indicated Resource of 103 million tonnes at 1,700 ppm lithium (equivalent to 0.9% lithium carbonate) and 1.31% boron (equivalent to 7.5% boric acid) at a 1,050ppm lithium and 0.5% boron cut-off. This shallow, high-grade lithium-boron mineralisation outcrops along the northwest and west sides of the South Basin Mineral Resource.\n\nThe lithium-only mineralisation in the Mineral Resource is excluded from the study as it is likely to require different processing. Testwork on the lithium-only mineralisation has not yet been completed, but it is reasonable to assume this mineralisation may be stockpiled for potential future processing.\n\nThe chart below shows the unconstrained mineable quantity above the marginal cut-off grade, that is, that material likely to be processed, and the associated average strip ratio as the Whittle pit shells become larger (limited only by the size of the Resource).\n\nA graph\u00a0accompanying this announcement is available at http:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/5ac52885-923a-445d-85a4-e58ef7b40ee7\n\nThe largest shell contains material above the marginal cut-off grade of 87 million tonnes at an average grade of 1,635 ppm lithium (equivalent to 0.87% lithium carbonate) and 1.35% boron (equivalent to 7.7% boric acid). Within this unconstrained shell, 91% is Indicated Resource and 9% is Inferred Resource.\u00a0 At an average strip ratio of 5.8:1 the total quantity of below cut-off grade material is approximately 505 Mt.\n\nThere is a low level of geological confidence associated with Inferred Resources and there is no certainty that further exploration work will result in the determination of Indicated Resources or that the production target itself will be realised.\n\nThe strip ratios for the smaller pit shells are significantly lower, particularly for the pit shells containing less than 10 million tonnes (shells 9 and below).\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at\u00a0http:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/38b35e26-38cb-4352-94cb-0756afe9d3ab\n\nPlan showing outlines of two pit shells in relation to the current Mineral Resource and outcrop. \r\nThe Resource remains open to the north, south and east.

It also means substantially lower capital and operating costs when compared to hard rock lithium deposits (spodumene, mica, clay) that require beneficiation and high temperature conversion or roaster to liberate the lithium prior to the lithium carbonate production process. Rhyolite Ridge \u2013 which recently had the high-grade portion of its Mineral Resource doubled - is a large, shallow sedimentary lithium-boron deposit located in southern Nevada, USA.\n\nGlobal Geoscience\u2019s Managing Director, Bernard Rowe said: \u201cThis is an exceptional result for GSC shareholders and a very significant breakthrough as we are not aware of any other lithium deposit where heap leach processing has been successfully demonstrated. Rhyolite Ridge\u2019s unique combination of minerals and low clay content is the key to efficiently recovering lithium and boron via heap leaching.\u00a0 What makes the mineralogy so important is that the lithium and boron minerals are very easily dissolved in sulphuric acid \u2013 meaning high recoveries and short leach times with acceptable sulphuric acid consumption.\u201d\n\n\"Our team has made significant progress in uncovering and understanding the unique properties of this deposit, and then applying this knowledge to test and design what is a simple processing flowsheet. These latest results further reinforce our view that we have an economic pathway to make the Rhyolite Ridge resource into a significant, low-cost, near-term producer of lithium carbonate and boric acid in America.\u201d\n\nSummary of Heap Leach Results\n\nHigh recoveries to PLS: 89-92% for lithium and 88-89% for boron Large samples: 150kg to 495kg Coarse feed: crushed to minus 150mm Rapid leach times: 30 days to get to 80% and 41 days to circa 90% Moderate net acid consumption:\u00a0 413kg per tonne of ore High permeability and high percolation rates maintained throughout tests Excellent column integrity: low mass loss (21%) and low slumping (<5%) PLS can be operated at close to boric acid saturation No agglomeration required\n\nThe Rhyolite Ridge Advantage\n\nRhyolite Ridge\u2019s unique mineralogy is what sets it apart from other lithium and lithium-boron deposits.\u00a0 Unlike other sedimentary and pegmatite (spodumene, mica) lithium deposits, the lithium (and boron) at Rhyolite Ridge are contained within minerals that are highly soluble in sulphuric acid.\u00a0 Compared to other sedimentary lithium deposits, the lithium-boron mineralisation at Rhyolite Ridge has very low clay content.\n\nThese unique characteristics mean that Rhyolite Ridge mineralisation is amenable to simple, low-cost acid leaching \u2013 including heap, vat and agitation (tank) leach.\u00a0 Unlike other sedimentary and pegmatite lithium deposits, Rhyolite Ridge does not require roasting prior to acid leaching, meaning significantly lower operating and capital costs.\n\nKey advantages include:\n\nNevada location: one of the world\u2019s most favourable mining locations and home to the USA\u2019s burgeoning electric vehicle industry.\u00a0 Well-developed infrastructure and skilled mining workforce. Unique mineralogy which distinguish it from other sedimentary lithium deposits and allow for a simple, low-cost acid leach extraction process.\u00a0 Unlike sedimentary clay deposits, no roasting or calcining is required. Unlike pegmatite (spodumene, mica) deposits, no conversion is required to produce lithium carbonate. Dual revenue streams from lithium and boron Simple ownership \u2013 100% Global Geoscience with no private royalties Large Mineral Resource containing 137 million tonnes of high-grade lithium boron mineralisation within a total Resource (Indicated & Inferred) of 460 million tonnes PFS stage - mining studies in progress, engineering studies about to commence Management and technical team with proven track record in the development and delivery of lithium and boron projects Ideally positioned to supply the lithium and boron markets in the USA and Asia\n\nBackground on Heap Leach Processing\n\nHeap leach processing is widely used around the world at more than 100 mining operations to extract gold, silver, copper, nickel, uranium and iodine.\u00a0 Gold and silver ores are leached using a dilute cyanide solution. Copper, nickel, uranium, boron, iodine and nitrate ores are leached using sulfuric acid.\n\nThe Company believes Rhyolite Ridge is the first lithium project where heap leach has been demonstrated to be an effective processing route.\u00a0 Heap leach processing has significant advantages over other forms of leaching including agitation (tank) leaching, which has been the focus of the Company\u2019s previous testwork, including:\n\nlower capital and operating costs simple design and equipment, relatively quick to construct minimal to no crushing required, no grinding or other preparation required no tailings and therefore less environmental impact lower energy requirements highly scalable, relatively quick and low cost to increase production rates\n\nAn overview of the heap leach flowsheet for Rhyolite Ridge is provided in the\u00a0diagram below.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/b41e7591-6065-4e1a-8398-60a8ee95df63\n\nA heap leach operation at Rhyolite Ridge would likely involve the following:\n\nRun-of-mine ore is crushed to between 50mm and 150mm The crushed ore is placed on a lined pad The ore is irrigated with sulphuric acid\/water solution (10% acid\/90% water) via drip feeder pipes The metals are dissolved into solution, forming a pregnant leach solution (\u201cPLS\u201d) The PLS is collected in a pond or tank Boron and lithium are recovered from the PLS and converted into boric acid and lithium carbonate by a combination of crystallisation and purification process steps Boron and lithium are recovered from the PLS and converted into boric acid and lithium carbonate by a combination of crystallisation and purification process steps, which initiated its testing at several testing facilities form PLS obtained by heap leach at KCA\u00a0 and agitated leach at Hazen.\n\nHeap Leach Testwork\n\nTestwork was conducted on samples collected from outcrop (424750E, 4185750N NAD27 Z11) from within the Rhyolite Ridge Mineral Resource. The samples are considered to be representative of the high-grade lithium-boron mineralisation across the Resource.\u00a0 Three large samples (150kg to 495kg) were prepared as follows:\n\nCoarse crush (minus 150mm) Blended with sulphuric acid to initiate the leach process Loaded into 37cm diameter columns of height 1.2m (150kg) and 4.4m (495kg) Dilute sulphuric acid solution was then applied to the top of the column using a continuously drained drip method at the rate of 10-20 litres per hour per square metre at ambient temperature PLS recovered at the base of the column was measured, sampled and analysed daily for lithium, boron and a suite of other elements.\n\nPhotos accompanying this announcement\u00a0are available at:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/3c48074b-91e8-403e-9291-01e742ad7a84http:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/a8f8169e-998f-402a-bcf3-a91a6bd3190bhttp:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/cb9cda78-6e77-4248-a9b8-15586cc30ee4http:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/09afc61f-073d-40d1-ad0b-9e028f149014http:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/4ca461b6-5ec4-4584-a4eb-98e13db63957\n\nFor the tall (4.4m) column, a 495 kg sample was blended with 15 kg of sulphuric acid (representing 3% of the sample weight) mixed with 50 litres of water. The acid-blending was done to initiate the leaching process and counteract the initial buffering of the acid from the carbonate minerals. The treated material was loaded into a 0.37 metre diameter column, yielding an initial height of 4.43 metres. \u00a0Fresh barren acid\/water solution was added daily to the column.\u00a0 Initially, lower acid concentrations were applied to the column to avoid blocking or slumping and to allow for close monitoring of the PLS.\u00a0 The acid concentration was gradually increased in order to lower the solution pH to ensure efficient leaching of the boron and lithium.\u00a0 The column was allowed to run for 164 days.\u00a0 At the end of the leach period, three batches of tap water were utilised to rinse the column before dumping the material.\n\nFor the first of the short (1.5m) columns, a 150 kg sample was blended with 15 kg of sulphuric acid (representing 10% of the sample weight) mixed with 7 litres of water. The treated material was loaded into a 0.37 metre diameter column, yielding an initial height of 1.22 metres.\u00a0 With the information gained from the tall column, higher acid concentrations were applied from day one, resulting in a much shorter leach period. Each day fresh barren 10% acid\/ 90% water solution was added to the top of the column. At the end of the 41-day leach period, three batches of tap water were utilised to rinse the column before dumping the material.\n\nFor the second of the short columns, a 150 kg sample was blended with 22.5 kg of sulphuric acid (representing 15% of the sample weight). The acid was added directly to the material and no water was added. The treated material was loaded into a 0.37 metre diameter column, yielding an initial height of 1.35 metres.

The mineralisation occurs in flat lying sedimentary rocks as two or more stacked layers or lenses. The sedimentary rocks are up to 300m thick and the mineralized layers within are 20-70m thick. The mineralized layers contain lithium only (clay-rich) and lithium-boron (clay-poor) mineralisation.\n\nThe lithium-only mineralisation typically contains over 2000ppm lithium, less than 0.02% boron and occurs in clay-rich layers. The lithium-boron mineralisation typically contains 1500-2000ppm lithium and greater than 1% boron, is higher in silica, sodium and potassium and lower in calcium and magnesium and occurs in 20m to 70m thick layers containing abundant searlesite (20-40%) and low in clay.\u00a0 Searlesite is a sodium-boron-silicate mineral.\u00a0 There are at least two separate layers of lithium-boron mineralisation (upper zone and lower zone) separated by 30-50m of barren sediments.\u00a0 The upper zone outcrops and the lower zone is shallow (<40m) along the western margin of South Basin. Both types of mineralisation are very consistent laterally over at least several square kilometers.\n\nThe host rocks are dominated by the minerals searlesite (boron-bearing), sepiolite (lithium-bearing), K-feldspar, calcite and dolomite. Unlike most other sedimentary-type lithium deposits, the lithium-boron mineralization at Rhyolite Ridge has low clay content.\n\nBoth basins have not been structurally disturbed since deposition and the strata\/mineralisation are very consistent laterally.\n\nResource Estimate\n\nThe Indicated and Inferred Resource estimate for the South Basin is 460 million tonnes at 1,700ppm lithium (equivalent to 0.9% lithium carbonate) and 0.46% boron (equivalent to 2.6% boric acid) at a 1,050ppm lithium cut-off.\u00a0 The Resource includes a high-grade lithium-boron zone totaling 137 million tonnes at 1,800 ppm lithium (equivalent to 0.9% lithium carbonate) and 1.26% boron (equivalent to 7.2% boric acid) at a 1050ppm lithium and 0.5% boron cut-off. The Indicated category comprises 75% of the high-grade lithium-boron Resource.\n\nOctober 2017 Mineral Resource Estimate (1,050ppm Li Cut-off) http:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/54939832-f824-4312-8b45-25e1494dccd9\n\nOctober 2017 Mineral Resource Estimate (1,050ppm Li Cut-off and 0.5% B Cut-off) http:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/015fdca9-1c89-45f5-85a2-64707187dead\n\nThe Resource remains open to the north, south and east and has significant potential to expand with further drilling of the South Basin.\u00a0 None of the known lithium-boron mineralisation at North Basin is included in the Mineral Resource estimate.\n\nFor further information regarding the resource estimate, refer to the announcement titled \u201cGlobal Geoscience Doubles High-Grade Lithium-Boron Mineral Resource\u201d dated 31 October 2017.\n\nMetallurgy\n\nMetallurgical testwork has focused on demonstrating that the lithium-boron mineralisation is amenable to acid leaching. Initially this testwork focused on a flowsheet involving crushing, grinding and flotation followed by agitation (tank) leaching. Flotation is used to remove acid-consuming carbonate minerals and reduce acid consumption.\u00a0 Results announced in May 2017 showed very high recoveries (>90%) for lithium and boron and lower than expected acid consumption rates (296kg acid per tonne of ore).\u00a0 Due to the very positive results and high recoveries obtained, a number of other potentially lower cost (capital and operating costs) acid leach options are being evaluated, including heap leach.\n\nFor further information regarding mineralogy and acid leaching, refer to announcement titled \u201cExceptional leach results and exercise of option for 100% ownership\u201d dated 2 May 2017.\n\nMining\n\nThe South Basin deposit is ideally suited to open pit mining methods as it is shallow, thick, consistent and gently dipping, resulting in a low strip ratio.\u00a0 RPM Global is close to completing a preliminary mining study\/analysis as part of the broader mining study being undertaken for the PFS.\u00a0 The study is evaluating conceptual pit designs and development, scheduling and mine site design and layout.\u00a0 Water and geotechnical investigations are being undertaken by Tierra Group International.\n\nWork in Progress \u2013 Upcoming News\n\nThe Rhyolite Ridge test program will continue to focus on work required for the Rhyolite Ridge PFS including:\n\nPreliminary mining study\/analysis \u2013 close to completion, results to be released soon Further optimisation of acid-leach process \u2013 in progress Crystallisation and purification testwork on PLS to produce lithium carbonate and boric acid \u2013 in progress PFS engineering study \u2013 about to commence Environmental, ground water and geotechnical studies \u2013 in progress\n\nContacts at Global Geoscience\n\nBernard RoweJames D.
