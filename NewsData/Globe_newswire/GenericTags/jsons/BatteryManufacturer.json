There exists vigorous demand for new energy vehicles whose sales would be even stronger if not for the \"long-term shortage of auto parts\" faced by OEMs.\r\n\r\nAs the global new energy vehicle market springs up, BMS for new energy vehicle takes a sizable market scale. In 2021, global NEV sales soared 108% year on year, which boosted the BMS market value to register $11.5 billion and rise 56.5% on an annualized basis.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, China's NEV sales reported 3.521 million units as a percentage of 54.2% in global total, with a year-on-year spike of 157.6% and the market penetration of 13.4%. As the world's largest producer and consumer of new energy vehicles, China's demand for BMS has been climbing continuously. The Chinese new energy vehicle BMS market was estimated to be worth RMB22.51 billion in 2021, up 90.6% from a year earlier.\r\n\r\nCompetition pricks up and OEMs enjoy superiorities\r\n\r\nThe global new energy vehicle BMS market is tripartite: carmakers represented by Tesla and BYD; the battery manufacturers like CATL and LGC; and the third-party BMS providers such as Ningbo Preh Joyson Automotive Electronics and SINOEV Technologies.\r\n\r\nAmong them, Tesla and BYD, with handsome NEV sales, were the top two giants sweeping 14.4% and 9.1% of the global new energy vehicle BMS market in 2021 respectively, followed by Preh Joyson (8.8%). Battery vendors CATL and LGC were ranked fourth and fifth.\r\n\r\nIn the Chinese NEV BMS market, BYD, CATL and Tesla stay ahead of others; wherein, BYD (FinDreams Battery) overtook CATL in 2021 to become the No.1 (a 15.5% share) whose deliveries skyrocketed 253.3% year on year.\r\n\r\nPreferential policies draw to an end, and the NEV BMS market will be impacted.\r\n\r\nIn April 2020, the Ministry of Finance, the State Taxation Administration and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology jointly issued the Announcement on Policies Relating to the Exemption of New Energy Vehicles from Vehicle Purchase Tax, proposing that from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2022, it will be exempt from purchase tax to buy NEVs.\r\n\r\nThe NEV subsidy policy will end on December 31, 2022, and vehicles licensed after December 31 will no longer be subsidized, according to the latest new energy vehicle purchase subsidy policy issued jointly by four ministries on December 31, 2021,\r\n\r\nStarting from 2023, the new energy vehicle purchase tax exemption and NEV purchase subsidies in China will be terminated concurrently, which will affect the NEV sales to a certain extent, thus inflicting the demand for BMS.\r\n\r\nNew energy vehicle BMS is evolving towards 'wireless, integrated and cloud-based'\r\n\r\nWireless\r\n\r\nWireless BMS has the merits of low power consumption, reduced in-package wiring harness, simplified structure, flexible deployment, etc., enabling lower assembly costs and weight reduction to agree with the lightweight trend of NEV. To date, ADI (Linear Technology), Texas Instruments, Visteon, NXP, etc. have forayed into wireless BMS.\r\n\r\nIntegrated\r\n\r\nWith a universe of data brought by intelligent connectivity, the automotive electronic and electrical architecture (EEA) has also been upgraded, with the domain controller highly integrating all features of the split BMS, VCU and MCU into one, for centralized control and management to form a true one \"system\".\r\n\r\nIn June 2020, ENOVATE's self-developed and world's first power domain controller --Vehicle Battery Unit (VBU) was successfully produced, integrating the key technologies of Vehicle Controller Unit (VCU) and Battery Management System (BMS), managing the 'motor, battery, electric control' system in a more efficient and accurate manner, while facilitating platform scalability and rapid iteration.\r\n\r\nCloud-based\r\n\r\nThe cloud-based BMS connects the BMS on electric vehicle to the cloud, enabling the whole life cycle of battery data to be \"uploaded to the cloud\" and the data collected to be evaluated with machine learning algorithms over the cloud to deliver better battery management strategies and battery failure warning functions.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, Huawei unveiled the pioneering AI BMS solution to address battery safety issue by a fusion of high-precision BMS chips with cloud-based AI technology. A number of automakers have cooperated with Huawei commercially and in depth, and Huawei's AI BMS cloud platform system has accessed to data of over 100,000 NEVs, successfully warning 10-plus cases of battery thermal runaway failures and enabling early treatment of some high-risk vehicles.\r\n The report highlights the following:\n\nPolicies about BMS, including NEV industry policy, BMS standards;Global and China new energy vehicle industry;Global and China BMS industry (status quo, market size, competition, development trend, etc.);14 global and 18 Chinese BMS vendors (operation, BMS business, etc.);3 global BMS chip vendors (operation, BMS chip solutions, etc.)\n\nKey Topics Covered:\r\n\r\n1 Overview\r\n1.1 Definition of BMS\r\n1.2 BMS Classification\r\n1.3 Core Functions of BMS\r\n1.3.1 Battery Cell Monitoring Technology\r\n1.3.2 Estimation Technology\r\n1.3.3 Balancing Technologies\r\n1.3.4 Core Features of BMS Software\r\n1.4 BMS Industry Chain\r\n\r\n2.

An index of global lithium prices compiled by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence has surged almost 490% in the past year.\n\nAt the March seminar, which included industry groups, raw materials suppliers and battery manufacturers, China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, demanded \u201ca rational return\u201d to more typical lithium prices. Talks focused on supply bottlenecks, pricing mechanisms and what officials described as the healthy development of the country\u2019s new-energy vehicle and battery sectors.\n\nWhile similar interventions to manage soaring commodity prices have been common for coal and steel, it\u2019s a rare step in the electric vehicle sector and underscores Beijing\u2019s nervousness about the impact of rising lithium costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs my colleague Danny Lee wrote earlier Monday, automakers are already grappling with the hikes in raw materials. Several have raised sticker prices in response. By making electric models too expensive, they risk slowing the pace of adoption.\n\n\u201cThe industry is facing a very strong headwind from cost escalation,\u201d Brian Gu, president of Xpeng Inc., told Bloomberg Television last week. The Guangzhou-based producer last month raised the price of its vehicles by between 10,100 yuan ($1,572) and 20,000 yuan.\n\nVehicle manufacturers are suffering from \u201copportunistic price hikes,\u201d to lithium products, Nio Inc.\u2019s founder William Li said on an earnings call last month. He urged suppliers to consider the impact of higher costs on development of the EV industry.\n\nThe sector\u2019s challenges follow decisions to slow or halt expansions and new projects during a two-year lithium price slump through the middle of 2020. That, combined with Covid-19 disruptions, means additions to supply simply can\u2019t keep pace with rising requirements.\n\nDemand for lithium will jump fivefold by the end of the decade, according to BloombergNEF. Roughly $14 billion of investment is needed to finance lithium resource and refining capacity by 2025, plus another as much as $5 billion by 2030, BNEF forecasts.\n\nThere are some signs that governments, producers and consumers are now recognizing the scale of that task.\n\nTesla Inc. signed two recent supply pacts with developers of future projects in Australia, while Ganfeng Lithium Co. \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest producers \u2014 said last week it\u2019ll use record profits to support a huge expansion program, aimed at delivering eventual capacity of 600,000 tons of lithium carbonate equivalent, compared to production of about 89,000 tons now.\n\nChina\u2019s authorities have called for quicker development of a domestic lithium sector that already dominates world production, highlighting growth prospects in Qinghai, Sichuan and Jiangxi provinces. In the U.S., President Joe Biden last week added battery metals, including lithium, to a list of items covered by the Defense Production Act, meaning companies can access funding to boost output or to study potential new developments.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nApple Makes It Easy to Work Remotely (Unless You Work for Apple) Amazon Warehouse Workers Just Redefined What\u2019s Possible for U.S. Labor Cashless ATMs Have Grown Into a $7 Billion Marijuana Loophole The Can\u2019t-Lose Betting Strategy That\u2019s Taking the Gamble Out of Sports Gambling Trump\u2019s Favorite Postmaster Is Surviving Biden\u2014and Maybe Even Saving the USPS\n\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/battery-metal-really-worrying-china-101503604.html","symbols":[],"tags":["BATTERY MANUFACTURERS","BLOOMBERG","CHINA","LITHIUM CARBONATE"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.975,"neg":0.034,"neu":0.895,"pos":0.071}},{"date":"2022-03-18T14:44:43+00:00","title":"Stellantis, LG Energy\u00a0Pick Ontario for Battery Plant","content":"(Bloomberg) -- Stellantis NV and LG Energy Solution will build their new battery plant in Ontario, Canada, according to a person familiar with the matter, with an official announcement likely on March 23.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPutin Likely to Make Nuclear Threats If War Drags, U.S. Says Biden Team Hardens View of China Tilting to Putin on Ukraine Ukraine Update: Russia Again Shells Western Areas Around Lviv Shock Waves From War in Ukraine Threaten to Swamp Sri Lanka Putin Vows to Rid Russia of \u2018Traitors\u2019 While Waging Ukraine War\n\nThe Canadian government\u2019s incentives for clean-energy businesses helped lure the companies, the person said, asking not to be identified because the decision isn\u2019t public.\n\nStellantis and LG Energy said in October they were planning a battery-cell making factory in North America, as Stellantis -- whose brands include Jeep and Ram -- expands its electric vehicle lineup with a goal of raising U.S. EV sales to 40% of deliveries by the end of the decade.

A look at key takeaways for investors on this emerging theme.\n\nNorthampton, MA --News Direct-- Morgan Stanley\n\nWhen the automobile industry began mass producing cars in the late 1940s, it sparked a booming oil economy encompassing everything from massive refineries to the corner gas station. More than half a century later, the automobile is once again reshaping established supply chains and creating a new industrial order\u2014only this one is built on the high-density lithium-ion batteries that power Electric Vehicles (EVs).\n\nMost investors understand that increasing demand for EVs is driving growth for battery makers and related industries. What the market may not fully appreciate, however, is the speed, breadth and complexity of the burgeoning global battery economy.\n\nNow, a combination of factors, including a new urgency for government and corporates to decarbonize and surging investments by auto and battery manufacturers, has shifted the battery market into high gear.\n\n\u201cThe battery economy could do for this century what oil did for the last,\u201d says Adam Jonas, who heads Morgan Stanley's Global Auto & Shared Mobility research. In response, Jonas and more than 25 of his equity analyst colleagues have created a new Global Battery team to map the entire value chain of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In a recent collaborative Bluepaper, the Research team identified 71 companies under their coverage that are best positioned for the exponential growth in the EV battery economy.\n\nMore than a single industry, batteries are a key investment theme with a total addressable market that could surpass $525 billion by 2040. \u201cThis story involves multiple sectors across cell manufacturing, specialty chemicals mining, equipment, components, machinery, packaging, and automakers,\u201d Jonas adds. As with any secular theme, the story will continue to evolve, but here are key things investors should know.\n\nStory continues\n\nBattery Market Has Shifted into High Gear\n\nBattery technology has been around for more than two centuries\u2014but the last decade has marked a major turning point for batteries spurred in no small part by Tesla.\n\nThe company opened doors for increased EV adoption, which in turn led to more investments in battery technology, and ultimately cheaper, better batteries. In fact, costs have come a long way since 2010, when battery prices were $1,100\/kWh, representing a 90% drop over ten years to about $110\/kWh today.\n\nMeanwhile, post-Covid climate polices and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) mandates have accelerated adoption. \u201cThe pandemic accelerated the development of the battery economy by at least five, if not 10 years,\u201d says Shawn Kim, who heads the Asia Technology research team at Morgan Stanley. The amount of capital investment in batteries is now 10 to 20 times higher than it was pre-Covid.\n\nBattery Trend May Span Decades\n\nMajor secular themes rarely follow a linear path, and batteries are no different. \u201cWe think it's helpful to think in terms of stages of development or 'epochs' as the story of the battery economy unfolds,\u201d says Stephen Byrd, Head of U.S. Power & Utilities and Clean Energy.\n\nIf the last decade was about proof of concept, the current epoch might be defined as the \u201cWild West\u201d of batteries, during which time surging EV penetration leads to a rapid period of project financing and joint ventures in the battery space\u2014and raises the risk of excess capacity globally. This epoch could also bring what analysts call the \u201cbalkanization\u201d of the battery industry as governments and regions establish their own secure supplies of batteries in the name of national energy security.\n\nThe next epoch\u2014beginning around 2030\u2014could be marked by significant consolidation, as well as higher levels of standardization and commoditization. During this period, we also expect to see well-capitalized new tech players challenging today\u2019s leaders.\n\nBeyond that, \u201cwe believe the automobile business model itself is fundamentally transformed into a transport utility where a combination of cheap batteries, renewable energy, and autonomy drive the incremental cost of the vehicle mile traveled to near zero,\u201d says Jonas.\n\nWhile the auto industry is carrying the necessary burden of revolutionizing the industry, batteries will likely be more widely applied to sectors of the future, including the internet of things (IoT), industrial autonomy, robotics, or defense.\n\nInvestors Should Beware Blind Spots\n\nDrawing on experience investing in other emerging technologies, Morgan Stanley analysts outlined a roadmap for investors navigating new adoption cycles. Early in the cycle, enablers of a new technology tend to lead the way. Subsequently, value creation shifts to the infrastructure and device makers with higher penetration. Toward the end of the cycle, opportunities shift to software and services companies that are able to capitalize on the growth of EVs.\n\nStill, there are many unknowns and risks to navigate along the way. \u201cThe battery industry is highly complex with dozens of mini self-reinforcing and some self-correcting supply\/demand curves to take into consideration,\u201d says Jonas. Indeed, many of the same factors that are driving the bull case for EV penetration could ultimately pose risks for today\u2019s battery incumbents\u2014as was the case for solar, LED and other emerging industries.\n\nThe Morgan Stanley Global Battery team has identified four potential blind spots, including excess investment, the \u201cbalkanization\u201d of the battery business, OEM vertical integration, and obsolescence risk on the way to cell and manufacturing breakthroughs.\n\nIn fact, lithium-ion batteries could ultimately be replaced by new technologies. The battery of the future may not even look like a cube or a cylinder. It could look like an airplane wing, car body, or phone case with a thin sheet of woven glass that separates the two electrodes.\n\nNo doubt, the global battery market will continue to evolve, which is all the more reason for investors to plug into this secular theme.\n\nFor more Morgan Stanley Research on electrification, ask your Morgan Stanley representative or Financial Advisor for the full report, \u201cThe New Oil: Investment Implications of the Global Battery Economy\u201d (Nov. 15, 2021).

(NYSE:RMO), compared to 14 in the previous quarter worth $18.7 million.\n\n6. Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 12\n\nLithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) is in the spotlight amid the rising demand for electric vehicles recently. The Canadian lithium mining company is expanding its lithium operations in Argentina, where its Cauchari-Olaroz project is set to begin production in mid-2022 with a capacity of 40,000 tonnes per year. The stock is up 75% over the last six months.\n\nAfter delivering Q3 earnings, Lithium Americas Corp.'s (NYSE:LAC) price target was upgraded to $44 from $25 by B. Riley analyst Lucas Pipes on November 24. Pipes kept a Buy rating on the lithium stock.\n\nSingaporean investment fund Himension Capital is the biggest shareholder of Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC), owning 2.27 million shares worth $51 million at the end of the September quarter. Overall, 12 funds of the 867 elite funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) at the end of the third quarter of 2021, up from 9 hedge funds in the preceding quarter.\n\nLithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC), together with electric car makers Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), is gaining attention from institutional investors.\n\nHere is what Massif Capital has to say about Lithium Americas Corp. in their Q1 2021 investor letter:\n\n\u201cLithium Americas: The volatility noted above in LAC has resulted in solid returns via our options trades around our core equity position. At the current time, we are short calls on LAC, as we have done multiple times throughout the position\u2019s life, expiring on May 21, 2021, at a $17.5 and $22.5 strike price. The volume of contracts sold at each strike corresponds to the size of the equity position we want should the calls expire in the money, and the underlying equity gets called away from us. The thought process behind this trade construction is that if we know the size of the position we want at a particular price point, there is no reason not to accumulate additional returns by pre-selling the stock we would have sold anyway.\n\nHigh levels of volatility positively impact the price of options, increasing the premium we can earn from selling covered calls. To date, we have sold covered calls on LAC that have expired worthless four times, yielding a roughly 7% return on the equity position\u2019s current value or 71bps for the portfolio overall. The outstanding covered calls appear to be trending towards a similar worthless expiration. If they do, the covered call trades on LAC will result in us owning the shares with committed capital of -$0.28 per share.\n\nAlthough we believe in the fullness of time LAC warrants a $30+ valuation, the prices achieved in early January of this year were not justified by the underlying fundamentals. Some will argue we should have sold down our position. We had already established our option positions and believe LAC is an emerging major in the lithium mining industry. Thus, we decided to maintain the position unchanged. Although still relatively high, the current $15 per share valuation is not crazy compared to where we think the firm should be trading based on fundamentals, so we are no longer overly concerned with the position as is.\n\nLAC management also took advantage of the volatility issuing stock on January 22 for $22 a share. The ~$400 million in proceeds will be used to develop Thacker Pass, the US-based clay lithium deposit, which will likely be the largest producing Lithium mine in America when turned on. In our opinion, the stock issuance could not have come at a better time. LAC management has advanced the project through various development stages (de-risking), but with the share issuance, they have significantly reduced the need to bring in an outside partner to develop the asset as the first phase of the project is expected to cost roughly $581 million. After-tax and at an 8% discount rate, the Thacker Pass project\u2019s present value is approximately $2.6 billion (the firm\u2019s current market capitalization is $1.5 billion). Although the share issuance was dilutive, increasing the total shares by 17%, we believe it will, in the long run, prove a forward-looking, value-additive decision by management.\n\nThe lithium market remains an area of interest and focus for us. This reflects our belief that the most exciting investment opportunities to capture secular trends in EV\u2019s and batteries are found upstream in the mining industry. It is also a reflection that there is a greater diversity of lithium investment opportunities relative to other battery metals.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best EV Battery Stocks To Invest In.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Best EV Charging Stocks to Buy Now 15 Most Valuable Data Companies in the World 10 Stocks Drawing Attention Post Quarterly Results\n\nDisclosure: None. 10 Best EV Battery Stocks To Invest Inis originally published on Insider Monkey.","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/10-best-ev-battery-stocks-140335019.html","symbols":["8GM.F","DCRC.US","F.MX","F.US","FDMO34.SA","FMC1.F","FMC1.XETRA","GM.MX","GM.US","GMCO34.SA","LAC.TO","LAC.US","MAT1.F","MATA.F"],"tags":["BATTERY MANUFACTURER","BATTERY MANUFACTURERS","CONTEMPORARY AMPEREX TECHNOLOGY CO","ELECTRIC VEHICLES","FORD MOTOR COMPANY","GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY","INC","LIMITED","PANASONIC CORPORATION","TESLA","TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION","VOLKSWAGEN AG"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.998,"neg":0.013,"neu":0.908,"pos":0.079}},{"date":"2022-01-06T01:00:00+00:00","title":"Could A Graphite Shortage Derail The $3 Trillion EV Boom?","content":"The $3-trillion EV market needs batteries that are 20-30% graphite\u2013a material the U.S. currently doesn\u2019t produce at all.\n\nThat makes graphite a matter of national security in the global energy race.\n\nEach EV battery requires not only lithium\u2013a metal that investors are very interested in\u2013but even more graphite, the metal that prevents the lithium batteries from breaking down.\n\nYet, the U.S. hasn\u2019t produced any graphite for decades.\n\nNow, with the EV market starting to explode, and automakers and battery manufacturers expected to consume far more than ever, we\u2019re looking at a nightmarish graphite supply chain that is mostly dependent on China\u2013but not necessarily on the Chinese.\n\nCurrently, China is one of the few countries with graphite processing facilities, but one of the leading producers in the world is an international company with both a North American technology and production arm and wholly owned Chinese subsidiaries and expert team operating since 2008. And it\u2019s parked right next to the largest graphite mine in the world, in China allowing it to secure this critical supply today while growing with the explosive demand of tomorrow.\n\nThe company is Graphex Group Ltd (OTCQX: GRFXY, 6128.HK), and we think it\u2019s one of the key companies set to benefit from a graphite market that is expected to continue towards a valuation of $22 billion and which Benchmark Mineral Intelligence predicts will be in shortage by the New Year.\n\nOur Pick For The Most Compelling Graphite Story\n\nBoth the United States and the European Union have now declared graphite a \u201csupply critical mineral\u201d.\n\nOver 70% of all graphite is produced in China. And even that output may be uncertain as gigafactory demand dictates a supply crunch. China remains dominant and even got a boost from the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw it very quickly recover from production facility closures, ensuring that the supply chain did not see any real diversification.\n\nThe math looks simple. With the majority of the graphite mined in the world coming out of China, and all anodes in EV batteries or energy storage components requiring graphite, whoever is manufacturing around the world has to utilize this material.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost of these battery manufacturers are Asian, so whether they are made in Korea or Japan, much of the graphite originates or is processed in China. From there, it either gets further processed in China or it moves to South Korea or Japan for Panasonic or LG, for instance, which make certain parts of the battery.\n\nFor North American investors who may have no way to get in on the looming graphite shortage outside of China, Graphex could make for quite a compelling story.\n\nAnd now Graphex is looking to jump into the U.S. market just as manufacturers may be about to feel a supply chain squeeze.\n\nGraphex are veteran graphite processors with major long-term contracts in China, and they\u2019re expecting double-digit demand growth over the next five years. \r\nWe think market fundamentals back that up perfectly.\n\nAmerican EV sales are expected to come in at 450,000 for 2021. Year-to-date sales through November were up 88% compared to 2020, and the New Year is gearing up for an even bigger surge as new models flood the marketplace. AutoPacific forecasts EV sales at 650,000 next year, for another 45% increase.\n\nGlobally, the numbers are even more impressive.\n\nEV sales more than doubled in 2021, even as overall car sales dropped under pandemic pressure.\n\nGiant Ford (NYSE:F) plans to produce up to 600,000 EVs a year globally by the end of 2023. That is already twice what it originally intended. Ford\u2019s F-150 pickup truck broke sales records, and the automaker is now gearing up to build three battery factories and an electric truck plant.\n\nBy 2025, we expect to see an astounding 13 new battery gigafactories coming to the U.S. alone.\n\nConsidering that there is more graphite in an EV battery than there is lithium, we\u2019re anticipating a major demand surge for this \u201csupply critical mineral\u201d.\n\nFor this battery material, it\u2019s all about processing, and it\u2019s not a market to easily entertain newcomers. The barrier to entry is technologically very high.\n\nGraphex (OTCQX: GRFXY, 6128.HK) is already well known in China. It\u2019s not only one of the top five graphite producing companies in China \u2026 it\u2019s one of the top globally.\n\nSet up right next to the largest graphite mine in the world, Graphex is producing 10,000 metric tons of spherical graphite\u2013which represents approximately 5% of China\u2019s total spherical graphite production.\n\nAnd right now, they are planning to increase production to 40,000 metric tons over the next three years.\n\nStability All-Around\n\nWe think the stability of this setup is one of the most attractive parts: Graphex says it has stable and expandable processing contracts with the Chinese state owned mining companies.\n\nIt has stable raw material supplies since it\u2019s located right next to the biggest flake graphite source in the world in China\u2019s Heilongjiang Province.?\n\nIt has 23 patents on its production methods, equipment design, environmental protection and graphene applications.\n\nCombine this with proprietary expertise for high-volume, high-yield spherical graphite production and a high-quality product that is ready for direct application in advanced batteries, and we believe you have quite a lot of investor confidence.\n\nEven better, it boasts a gross margin of around 28%, with raw materials coming in at around $600 and final product being sold for about $2800. This helped give the company $51 million in revenues in 2020.\n\nIt also wins environmental approval in line with the global energy transition. Though Graphex has capabilities to produce synthetic graphite, it\u2019s primary focus is on producing natural graphite. Synthetic graphite is an energy-intensive coke-based product that has been detrimental enough to prompt the Chinese authorities to shut down and then restrict production over the last few years.\n\nComing to America\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s more to the Graphex game plan than a ramp-up to 40,000 metric tons \u2026\n\nThese veterans are in the process of expanding to North America and the European Union in the near-term. They look poised to enter these markets as one of only a few companies able to support this growing manufacturing expansion in North America. On the supply side, they are capable of supplying their own material from their wholly owned facilities in Asia while exploring additional supply globally. On the production front, they have the ability to process both in Asia and focusing now on setting up production locally near domestic manufacturing. This is where Graphex could become not only one of the top producers in the world, but also a potential top tier production and technology company.\n\nGraphex (OTCQX: GRFXY, 6128.HK) proprietary technology helps upgrade less valuable flake graphite into far more valuable uncoated spherical or coated spherical graphite. That\u2019s a difference of $600 per ton and up to $12,000 per ton.\n\nWorking with downstream companies and local authorities in the U.S. and Canada, Graphex intends to use its patents, proprietary expertise, and experience to create solutions for the construction of facilities and production lines for spherical graphite.\n\nAnd in the longer term, they\u2019re planning to partner with auto supply chain companies for the production of coated spherical graphite, with downstream expansion into anode and battery production.\n\nConstructing facilities that can process high-demand spherical graphite in America at this point is a business move in line with the national interest.\n\nWith graphite demand set to soar along with the anticipated growth of EVs, energy storage and more battery gigafactories than anyone could have imagined just a couple of years ago, this \u201csupply critical material\u201d could be one of the best back-door investment themes of the energy transition boom.\n\nElectric Vehicle Producers Are Set To Grow In The Coming Years\n\nDue in part to a massive influx of millennial money and the multi-trillion-dollar green energy boom, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is still the king of EVs in America. The company accounts for the majority of total EV sales in the country and just broke another production and delivery record last quarter. But legacy carmakers are pouring billions into EVs, and hundreds of new models are coming to the market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that Tesla\u2019s still dominating electric vehicle sales because they\u2019re the only ones that really have viable products in full swing,\u201d IHS Markit associate director Michael Fiske told CNBC.\n\n\u201cIn a growth market, it\u2019s extremely challenging to maintain majority market share, regardless of industry. \u2026 As we start to move toward a larger and really significant number of manufacturers that are going to be playing in the space, Tesla has to lose share.\u201d\n\nNio Limited (NYSE:NIO) is one of Tesla\u2019s most exciting new competitors, especially as China looks to grow its domestic market. After a rough start after going public in 2018, it\u2019s been on a tear, producing vehicles with record-breaking range. And it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing.\n\nNio has made all the right moves over the past year to turn heads on the streets and in the marketplace... From its stunningly beautiful - and fast - EP9 supercar to its new line of family-friendly high-performance sedans, Nio is well on its way to retaking control of its local market from Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle giant.\n\nThe future of vehicle transportation is here. Xpeng Motors (NYSE:XPEV) has developed an all-electric, fully autonomous car that can be ordered with a few taps on your phone. It features a range of 250 miles and will get you from point A to B in less time than it would take to hail a cab or drive yourself. This game-changing company is set to disrupt the world's automotive industry with unparalleled convenience and affordability for everyone.\n\nXpeng has also been drawing plenty of interest from Big Money, managing to raise nearly a billion dollars from heavy hitters such as Alibaba, Abu Dhabi\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Qatar Investment Authority, Hillhouse Capital, and Sequoia Capital China.\n\nNewcomers like Xpeng provide an excellent opportunity for investors who missed out on Tesla\u2019s meteoric rise or Chinese Tencent-backed Nio\u2019s storming of the market in 2020--even if its shares did rise too far, too fast.\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is another up-and-comer in the Chinese electric vehicle space. And while it may not be a veteran in the market like Tesla or even NIO, it\u2019s quickly making waves on Wall Street. Backed by Chinese giants Meituan and Bytedance, Li has taken a different approach to the electric vehicle market. Instead of opting for pure-electric cars, it is giving consumers a choice with its stylish crossover hybrid SUV. This popular vehicle can be powered with gasoline or electricity, taking the edge off drivers who may not have a charging station or a gas station nearby.\n\nLi Auto has already seen its stock price nearly double since its IPO. And though it hasn\u2019t quite returned to its all-time highs, it remains a fairly stable stock. It\u2019s already worth more than $30 billion but it\u2019s just getting started. And as the EV boom accelerates into high gear, the sky is the limit for Li and its competitors.\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is one of Detroit\u2019s old school automakers, and it\u2019s looking to catch a ride on the EV bandwagon, benefiting from a shift from gas-powered to alternative technology such as hydrogen and electricity. It\u2019s now well over 100 years old and has survived where many others have failed. Even with the downfall of Detroit, GM has persisted, and that\u2019s due in large part to its ability to adapt.\n\nRecently, GM dropped a bomb on the market with the announcement of its new business unit, BrightDrop. The company is looking to capture a key share of the burgeoning delivery market, with plans to sell electric vans and services to commercial delivery companies.\n\nGM isn\u2019t just betting big on EVs, either. It\u2019s also looking to capitalize on the autonomous vehicle boom. Recently, it announced that it\u2019s a majority-owned subsidiary, Cruise, has just received approval from the California DMV to test its autonomous vehicles without a driver. And while they\u2019re not the first to receive such an approval, it\u2019s still huge news for GM.\n\nCruise CEO Dan Ammann wrote in a Medium post, \u201cBefore the end of the year, we\u2019ll be sending cars out onto the streets of SF \u2014 without gasoline and without anyone at the wheel. Because safely removing the driver is the true benchmark of a self-driving car, and because burning fossil fuels is no way to build the future of transportation.\u201d\n\nFord (NYSE:F) is another old-school automaker taking the dive into greener waters. In addition to brand-new electric versions of its best-sellers, the F-150 and iconic Mustang, it\u2019s also carving out its own position in the hydrogen race, as well. In fact, it recently even unveiled the world\u2019s first-ever fuel cell hybrid plugin electric vehicle, the Ford Edge HySeries.\n\nFord became the best-performing auto industry stock last year, beating investor favorite Tesla as it doubled down on an all-electric future. 2021 was \u201ctruly a breakthrough year for Ford \u2026 easily the most important year strategically for the company since the financial crisis,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas told CNBC.\n\nThis year saw soaring orders for the company\u2019s Mustang Mach-3 SUV, including an order for 184 of the EVs from several New York City government agencies. The order comes in at $11.5 million, putting the price tag for the Mach-3 SUV at $62,500. Yet people are buying them like hot cakes based on order numbers.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the Mach-3, either. Last month, Ford had to halt reservations for the upcoming F-150 Lightning pickup truck after hitting 200,000.\n\nDemand for electric vehicles has been ramping up steadily for years. But as we\u2019re approaching the tipping point, there\u2019s a problem that many people are still ignoring And that's where Chargepoint (NYSE:CHPT) comes in, one of the largest charging station networks in the country.\n\nThis leading EV infrastructure player went earlier this year through one of the market's hottest trends. That made them the first EV charging stock to have gone public via a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. When it comes to the supercharged Level 2 EV charging stations, ChargePoint is the clear leader in the industry.\n\nWhile Level 1 stations allow you to charge a Mercedes B Class 250e in around 20 hours...Level 2 chargers cut that down to just 3 hours to fully charge that same vehicle.\n\nThat's a massive difference for people worried about having to spend nearly a day charging their vehicles before getting back on the road. And ChargePoint has a whopping 73% of the market share of networked Level 2 charging stations.\n\nBlink (NASDAQ:BLNK) is another electric vehicle charging company. Its unique proposition is that many of the company's charging stations are found in practical locations, such as airports and hotels, making it convenient for drivers to charge up while waiting on flights or in their rooms. A wave of new deals, including a collaboration with EnerSys and another with Envoy Technologies to deploy electric vehicles and charging stations makes it an especially interesting company.\n\nBlink Charging really is a mature company, having been around since 1998. Its unique proposition is that many of the company's charging stations are found in practical locations, such as airports and hotels, making it convenient for drivers to charge up while waiting on flights or in their rooms.\n\nBlink has also been particularly active inking new deals, including 26 dual-port Level 2 IQ 200 EV charging stations at key Burger King locations across the Northeast; 20 Blink-owned IQ 200 electric vehicle charging services with Illinois' Blessing Health, and an exclusive seven-year agreement with Lehigh Valley Health Network for the former to own and operate charging stations across the health network's extensive portfolio of locations.\n\nGreenPower Motor (TSX:GPV) is an exciting company that produces larger-scale electric transportation. Right now, it is primarily focused on the North American market, but the sky is the limit as the pressure to go green grows. GreenPower has been on the frontlines of the electric movement, manufacturing affordable battery-electric busses and trucks for over ten years. From school busses to long-distance public transit, GreenPower\u2019s impact on the sector can\u2019t be ignored.\n\nNFI Group (TSX:NFI) is another one of Canada\u2019s most exciting electric mass-transit makers. Though it has not yet rebounded from January highs, NFI still offers investors a promising opportunity to capitalize on the electric vehicle boom at a discount. In addition to its increasingly positive financial reports, it is also one of the few in the business that actually pay dividends out to its investors. This is huge because it gives investors an opportunity to gain exposure to this booming industry while the stock is cheap and hold steady until the market finally discovers this gem.\n\nAnother way to gain exposure to the electric vehicle industry is through AutoCanada (TSX:ACQ), a company that operates auto-dealerships through Canada. The company carries a wide variety of new and used vehicles and has all types of financial options available to fit the needs of any consumer. While sales have slumped this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, AutoCanada will likely see a rebound as both buying power and the demand for electric vehicles increases. As more new exciting EVs hit the market, AutoCanada will surely be able to ride the wave.\n\nLithium Americas Corp. (TSX:LAC) is one of America\u2019s most critical and promising pure-play lithium companies. With two world-class lithium projects in Argentina and Nevada, Lithium Americas is well-positioned to ride the wave of growing lithium demand in the years to come. It\u2019s already raised nearly a billion dollars in equity and debt, showing that investors have a ton of interest in the company\u2019s ambitious plans.\n\nLithium America is not looking over the growing pressure from investors for responsible and sustainable mining, either. In fact, one of its primary goals is to create a positive impact on society and the environment through its projects. This includes cleaner mining tech, strong workplace safety practices, a range of opportunities for employees, and strong relationships with local governments to ensure that not only are its employees being taken care of but local communities, as well.\n\nCelestica (TSX:CLS) is a key company in the resource boom due to is role as one of the top manufacturers of electronics in North America. Celestica\u2019s wide range of products includes but is not limited to communications solutions, enterprise and cloud services, aerospace and defense products, renewable energy, and even healthcare tech.\n\nDue to its exposure to the renewable energy market, Celestica\u2019s future is tied hand-in-hand with the green energy boom that\u2019s sweeping the world at the moment. It helps build smart and efficient products that integrate the latest in power generation, conversion and management technology to deliver smarter, more efficient grid and off-grid applications for the world\u2019s leading energy equipment manufacturers and producers.\n\nTeck Resources (TSX:TECK) could be one of the best-diversified miners out there, with a broad portfolio of Copper, Zinc, Energy, Gold, Silver and Molybdenum assets. It\u2019s even involved in the oil scene! With its free cash flow and a lower volatility outlook for base metals in combination with a growing push for copper and zinc to create batteries, Teck could emerge as one of the year\u2019s most exciting miners.\n\nThough Teck has not quite returned to its January highs, it has seen a promising rebound since April lows. In addition to its positive trajectory, the company has seen a fair amount of insider buying, which tells shareholders that the management team is serious about continuing to add shareholder value. In addition to insider buying, Teck has been added to a number of hedge fund portfolios as well, suggesting that not only do insiders believe in the company, but also the smart money that\u2019s really driving the markets.\n\nBy.

While South Africa has no lithium-ion battery cell manufacturers, several companies are involved in battery pack assembly. Demand for all types of batteries is also expected to come from the rollout of renewable energy projects.\n\nBattery demand in South Africa is being driven by the growth in the number of renewable energy projects, an increasing number of homeowners and by industrial and commercial users looking for a reliable energy source as load-shedding continues.\n\nGlobal sales of new energy vehicles (battery, hybrid and fuel cell) accelerated in 2020, despite the decrease in new vehicle sales due to the pandemic. The number of electric vehicles in South Africa is small, although studies indicate the importance of local vehicle manufacturers moving away from combustion engine vehicles to ensure the industry's long-term sustainability. Electric vehicles are expensive and there is a limited charging infrastructure. Import tariffs are a significant inhibitor for investment in electronic vehicle manufacturing.\n\nIn South Africa, the energy storage market continues to grow, as new independent power producer projects come on stream and as load-shedding continues. Load-shedding is driving demand for back-up power and uninterrupted power supply applications, particularly in commercial, industrial and agricultural applications where the costs of energy insecurity are high.\n\nThis report focuses on the manufacture of batteries and includes comprehensive information on the state of the sector including primary, automotive, energy storage, industrial and lithium-ion batteries, electric vehicles, technology, recycling and other environmental factors.\n\nThere are profiles of nine companies including Eveready, the only primary battery manufacturer in South Africa and other major brands such as Energizer and Duracell.

I am confident that we are delivering an excellent balance in terms of competitiveness, sustainability, and business growth to position the Company as a turn-key solution provider to the electric vehicles (\"EVs\") and energy storage sectors.\"\n\nBattery-Grade Anode Material\n\nNouveau Monde completed construction of the phase-1 B\u00e9cancour purification facility on budget and with limited timeline impact following delays in equipment deliveries. In the final stages of commissioning, the Company has produced batches that demonstrate the performance of Nouveau Monde\u2019s proprietary ecotechnology and the high battery-grade quality of spherical purified graphite (\"SPG\").\n\nThe material has been tested at Nouveau Monde\u2019s new state-of-the-art laboratory and a third-party mineral R&D center, confirming purity of +99.99%, well above the level required for energy applications. Loss on ignition (\"LOI\") was carried out based on ASTM standard test method C561\u201316, and ICP analysis of critical elements like iron and nickel showed results at below 1 ppm.\n\nThe Company has submitted a patent application to safeguard its intellectual property rights in regard to this thermochemical purification technology, a greener alternative, free of hydrofluoric acid, to that currently used in the traditional anode material production.\n\nPreparation is underway at the Company\u2019s demonstration plant to double its phase-1 shaping production and build a phase-1 coating module. Both beneficiation units are scheduled for construction and commissioning in H1-2022 to provide Nouveau Monde\u2019s sales team with up to 2,000 tpa of anode material to support production qualification and commercial discussions with battery and EVs manufacturers.\n\nIn addition, Nouveau Monde continues the FEL-3 feasibility study for the large scale phase 2 B\u00e9cancour battery material plant regrouping operations of all processing steps. Considering the Company\u2019s development of advanced manufacturing of anode material to cater to the accelerating lithium-ion batteries market (see the \"Escalating Market Trends\" section below), the study will reflect Nouveau Monde\u2019s integrated business model for a comprehensive planning, cost projection, and development framework. The Matawinie mining project\u2019s National Instrument 43-101 feasibility study covering the West Zone deposit will be updated on the back of the latest mineral resource update and the value-added transformation steps that are part of the B\u00e9cancour battery material plant. Upon completion of the study, Nouveau Monde intends to transition to the execution phase and to sequence construction timelines of the phase-2 mine and battery material plant.\n\nCivil Works at Matawinie Mining Project\n\nConstruction of the Matawinie mining project\u2019s nearly 8-km access road is on time and on budget, with works completed at 70%. Civil works for the industrial platform has started and will continue in 2022. In parallel, concentrator and building engineering for process, electrical, structural, piping, and layout are finalized to prepare the plans and specifications. The tailings deposition plan, water management infrastructure and mining equipment selection are progressing ahead of the next stages of preparatory work.\n\nIn parallel, Nouveau Monde and Caterpillar\u2019s technical teams are collaborating to plan the development, testing, and deployment of Cat\u00ae zero-emission machines for the all-electric mining fleet.\n\nContinued Sales Engagement\n\nIn its efforts to negotiate a long-term cornerstone supply agreement, the Company is thus far engaged in commercial discussions and\/or has signed MoUs and NDAs with manufacturers whose total projected yearly production capacity represent over 1 TWh by 2030, that would correspondingly require over 1 million tonnes per annum of battery-grade graphite. Nouveau Monde\u2019s phase-1 operations support technical marketing and product qualification efforts thanks to samples provided to potential customers as part of these discussions.\n\nNouveau Monde recently joined the marketplace at North America\u2019s largest and most comprehensive advanced battery manufacturing event, The Battery Show. The Company will be present at the upcoming European edition, in Germany, scheduled November 30 to December 2, 2021, to position its ex-China green supply of anode material in this booming market. Nouveau Monde will present the latest results of its hydrofluoric acid-free purified anode material as well as the latest electrochemical test results on its graphite at its booth #232 (hall 8). Nouveau Monde is striving to provide solutions to the European lithium-ion battery market looking for security of supply, guaranteed material traceability, competitive pricing, and low CO2 footprint anode material. Visitors can organize a meeting by contacting Jean-Luc Cialdini, Business Development Director for Europe, at jlcialdini@nmg.com.\n\nCorporate Development & Sustainability\n\nCommitted to its zero-harm philosophy, Nouveau Monde maintains the focus on environmental, health, and safety performance at its operational sites, with special attention to the start of civil works at the Matawinie mining project and the commissioning of the phase-1 B\u00e9cancour purification facility.\n\nAs sustainable funds saw their combined assets climb to $3.9 trillion at the end of Q3-2021 (Morningstar, October 2021), Nouveau Monde published its inaugural Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") Report to provide an overview of Nouveau Monde\u2019s core commitments, anchor initiatives, and performance indicators to shareholders and asset managers.\n\nEric Desaulniers, Founder, President, and CEO of Nouveau Monde, added: \"We are developing our carbon-neutral operations on a foundation of transparency and superior environmental, social, and governance standards. We believe consumers and manufacturers alike are seeking high-performing solutions that are extracted and transformed responsibly. Nouveau Monde\u2019s strong commitment in this regard, from inception, represents a vantage for engagement with communities, governments, capital markets, and customers.\"\n\nAt September 30, 2021, the Company had more than $81M CA in cash, which is sufficient to support its current operations and the advancement of its key projects.\n\nEscalating Market Trends\n\nScientists and the international community are increasingly aligning efforts and funds to transition to net zero by 2050 in order to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis. The push for electrification as part of decarbonization goals translate into favorable market conditions for Nouveau Monde\u2019s carbon-neutral anode material.\n\nDemand outlook for anode manufacturing is mounting to meet the projected 4,625 GWh of global lithium-ion battery production capacity in the pipeline by 2030, a 13% increase since the end of Q2-2021 (Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, October 2021). October announcements from battery manufacturers totaled 430,000 tpa of new anode production capacity, elevating the global projection to 5,030,700 tpa.\n\nRepresenting +95% of the anode, graphite is the most controlled mineral of all battery materials, with China currently producing 100% of the global spherical graphite supply. Graphite prices continue to rise as a result of energy shortages in some Chinese provinces and major logistics disruptions (Roskill, October 2021). These price increases are a reminder of the importance of establishing strong partnerships with reliable and local suppliers such as Nouveau Monde to mitigate that risk.\n\nProjected to be the largest and most advanced natural graphite operation in North America, Nouveau Monde is carrying out its de-risked phased development plan to build a localized, turn-key, and carbon-neutral alternative to Chinese supply.\n\nAbout Nouveau Monde\n\nNouveau Monde is striving to become a key contributor to the sustainable energy revolution. The Company is working towards developing a fully integrated source of carbon-neutral battery anode material in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada for the growing lithium-ion and fuel cell markets. With low-cost operations and enviable ESG standards, Nouveau Monde aspires to become a strategic supplier to the world\u2019s leading battery and automobile manufacturers, providing high-performing and reliable advanced materials while promoting sustainability and supply chain traceability. www.NMG.com\n\nSubscribe to our news feed: https:\/\/NMG.com\/investors\/#news\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\n\nAll statements, other than statements of historical fact, contained in this press release including, but not limited to those describing the progress of the Company\u2019s projects within budget, the feasibility study of the phase-2 B\u00e9cancour battery material plant, including the Company\u2019s integrated business model, the progress of commercial discussions, including the entering into a cornerstone supply agreement, market trends and conditions, the Company\u2019s presence at the EU Battery Show, demand outlook for anode manufacturing, the efforts of different sectors to achieve the Paris Agreement\u2019s goals and net-zero, the doubling of the phase-1 shaping production and the construction of the phase-1 coating module, the timeline and the expected output regarding same, the update of the 43-101 feasibility study and the steps that follow its completion, the electrification of the mining pit, the total projected yearly production capacity of potential business partners, the solutions the Company can provide to the European lithium-ion battery market, the Company\u2019s commitments towards ESG principles, the Company\u2019s forecast to become the largest and most advanced natural graphite operation in North America, and those statements which are discussed under the \"About Nouveau Monde\" paragraph and elsewhere in the press release which essentially describe the Company\u2019s outlook and objectives, constitute \"forward-looking information\" or \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of certain securities laws, and are based on expectations, estimates and projections as of the time of this press release.

(\u201cNouveau Monde\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE: NMG, TSXV: NOU) is enhancing its production capacity for advanced graphite solutions through investments in phase-1 operations. The Company is deploying its business strategy to test manufacturing technologies, refine processes, inform commercial development, and support technical marketing and product qualification efforts targeting the lithium-ion batteries (\u201cLiB\u201d) market.\n\nNouveau Monde\u2019s investment in developing this initial advanced graphite materials manufacturing platform is supported by continued engagement with potential tier-1 customers in the EV and battery sector. Thus far, these manufacturers, with whom the Company is engaged in commercial discussions and\/or have signed MoUs and NDAs, represent a total projected yearly production capacity of approximately 1 TWh by 2030 that would correspondingly require over 1 million tonnes per annum of battery-grade graphite.\n\nStory continues\n\nArne H Frandsen, Chairman of Nouveau Monde, commented: \u201cNouveau Monde is executing its business plan with rigor to provide the marketplace with the product specs and sustainability excellence that tier-1 manufacturers are seeking. In the global push toward decarbonization, I am confident that our focus on technology, derisked expansion approach, and superior commercial engagement will yield success and benefits for all our stakeholders.\u201d\n\nEric Desaulniers, Founder, President, and CEO of Nouveau Monde, added: \u201cWe remain focused on our commercial strategy to position Nouveau Monde as a turn-key supplier to leading EV and battery manufacturers. Sales discussions and product qualification have thus far reiterated the importance of local, carbon-neutral, reliable, and ESG-rooted supply chains for our tier-1 potential customers. We are committed to delivering on these attributes, which are central to Nouveau Monde\u2019s value proposition while maintaining low-cost productivity and continually enhancing technology development.\u201d\n\nFor graphite concentrate to be used as anode material, three beneficiation steps are required to reach the optimal physical properties and performance: shaping, purification, and coating. Nouveau Monde plans to leverage its access to the large, high-purity Matawinie graphite deposit as feedstock for its value-added transformation, hence capitalizing on operational efficiency, product traceability, and greater margins from its vertically integrated business model.\n\nThe Company\u2019s phase-1 capacity is targeted at 2,000 tpa of anode material with scope for significant expansion in Phase 2 to help meet the demand from battery manufacturers seeking locally sourced and environmentally friendly materials.\n\nPhase-1 Facilities: Increased Capacity & Integrated Anode Material Manufacturing\n\nNouveau Monde\u2019s commercial-size shaping unit has been producing spherical graphite since Q1-2020. To support its phase-1 expansion, the Company has collaborated with a Western World equipment manufacturer during the past last year to test a new shaping technology. The successful results have led Nouveau Monde to purchase another commercial-scale module, hence doubling its production capability. The new state-of-the-art unit should further elevate the products\u2019 quality and provide customers with a greater variety of specs.\n\nSite preparation has started at the Company\u2019s demonstration plant ahead of the delivery and installation. The equipment commissioning is expected to be carried out in early 2022 for a production start and ramp up during 2022.\n\nIn parallel, Nouveau Monde has initiated test batches at its phase-1 purification facility in B\u00e9cancour, Qu\u00e9bec, as it finalizes production parameters. The Company plans to start supplying 99.95%-pure spherical purified graphite (\u201cSPG\u201d) to potential customers before the end of Q3-2021. Last month, Nouveau Monde submitted a patent application for its proprietary thermochemical purification technology, which offers a greener and more sustainable alternative to that currently used in traditional anode material production.\n\nAs the third and final step in the beneficiation for anode material, Nouveau Monde has integrated coating into its advanced manufacturing platform. The value-added transformation entails applying a nanometric layer of amorphous carbon on the surface of SPG to reduce the graphite\u2019s porosity, decrease exfoliation, and therefore increase the performance and life span of batteries. Laboratory testing has already validated Nouveau Monde\u2019s technology with demonstrated superior performance over the anode material from Asian commercial producers.\n\nNouveau Monde is leveraging existing technology for this special application and harnessing its access to hydroelectricity to power the unit, hence reducing energy consumption by 25% compared to current practices and improving the coated spherical purified graphite (\u201cCSPG\u201d) environmental footprint. Through its R&D program, the Company is also validating the possibility of upgrading the co-products of the shaping step via coating, which could benefit Nouveau Monde\u2019s profitability at the commercial stage.\n\nDetailed engineering is advanced at more than 50% for the Company\u2019s coating line, and procurement of all key equipment was completed earlier this year. Gradual deliveries of equipment are scheduled to arrive at the Company\u2019s plant starting in Q4-2021 and continue into the new year. Construction and commissioning activities will follow accordingly, with the objective of commencing production around the end of Q1-2022.\n\nPhase-2 LiB Anode Material Plant: Ongoing Feasibility Study\n\nProduction from this phase-1 anode material beneficiation line will support the ongoing engineering of the large-scale phase-2 battery material plant. Following positive results of an internal FEL-1 scoping study earlier this year, Nouveau Monde is proceeding with the complete feasibility study with its consulting firm BBA, which is scheduled to be completed in Q2-2022. Upon completion of the study, Nouveau Monde intends to transition to the execution phase of the Phase 2 project on the Company\u2019s 200,000 m2 land parcel in the B\u00e9cancour Industrial Park.\n\nBy expanding its advanced materials manufacturing platform, Nouveau Monde strives to position itself as a leading western producer capable of supplying tier-1 customers at every step of graphite transformation. Backed by its scaled development and proprietary technologies, the Company is actively engaging with tier-1 EV and battery manufacturers in its effort to negotiate a long-term cornerstone supply agreement.\n\nAbout Nouveau Monde\n\nNouveau Monde is striving to become a key contributor to the sustainable energy revolution.

AMB's electrodes not only have the potential to save cost, but also offer a path toward fast charging, higher-energy density, and adaptability. AMB has early industry attraction to adopt this technology for pilot scale to mass production.\n\nAMB has developed a novel additive Li-ion manufacturing technique by which the active materials (cathode\/anode) are charged and sprayed onto metal foil current collectors, which are then processed to its final state to make batteries without the use of toxic solvent. This dry- coating method offers significant cost and energy savings over state-of-the-art \"wet coating\" procedures, providing a dramatic improvement to the sustainability of the overall cell making process. TDK Ventures' investment in AMB marks its continued focus on core technologies that catalyze broader decarbonization efforts via sustainable and scalable battery technologies.\n\n\"Our technology is extremely innovative and outside the box,\" stated Yan Wang AMB Co-founder and CEO. \"TDK Ventures' proprietary knowledge and unique insights in the battery-manufacturing space helped validate our own technological progress. They also played a significant role in bringing a broad syndicate of financial, strategic, and OEM partners together by sharing their key techno-economic insights, thereby helping us assemble a world-class set of partners for our company.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nRiding the rising tide of EVs, the demand for lithium-ion batteries has never been higher - with an expected need for more than 2,000 GWh by 2030. With this significant manufacturing capacity demand, environmental and carbon footprint are under increased scrutiny. Current wet-electrode manufacturing techniques consume up to 50% of the total manufacturing energy of the entire battery, require significant factory footprint to dry the solvent, and increase the CAPEX required for manufacturing plants. One of the most fundamental problems for battery manufacturers today is refining manufacturing techniques. Refining manufacturing techniques to remove the solvent is one of the most fundamental problems for all battery manufacturers today in the consumer electronics, large scale energy storage, and EV markets.\n\nDuring Tesla's 2020 Battery Day last year, CEO Elon Musk said that dry-electrode technology is one of the most vital components for a step-change in the cost reduction of EV batteries; he also stated significant room for the technology's maturation and improvement. Tesla acquired Maxwell Technologies in early 2019 with an eye on potentially commercializing their dry-electrode technology.\n\n\"AMB has engineered a three-step electro-spraying system that seamlessly aligns with the existing process flow of lithium-battery manufacturing, which is not the case in competitive solutions, putting them at the very forefront of the industry,\" said Nicolas Sauvage, President of TDK Ventures. \"In the future, we believe that battery manufacturers will not only differentiate on energy density, fast charge ability, or cost\/kW, but also on the amount of CO2 emitted per the amount of energy stored, which is a measure of how sustainable one's electrode manufacturing process is. This positioning is a whole new value proposition for next-generation battery manufacturers and EV OEMs that align with consumer needs.\"\n\nEric Rosenblum, Foothill Ventures' Managing Partner commented: \"The battery market for EVs is one of the world's most important markets, and this technology addresses two of the biggest issues: cost and sustainability. Dr. Yan Wang has proven himself to be one of the most successful inventors and serial entrepreneurs in the battery space, and we are also thrilled to partner again with TDK Ventures.\"\n\nAMB closed its seed round of $3M in funding September 2021 with TDK Ventures and Foothill ventures co-leading the round. SAIC Capital (Tier I manufacturer), VinFast (Vietnamese EV OEM), Doral Energy-Tech Ventures (Israel Renewable Energy Company), Creative Ventures (financial VC firm from Silicon Valley) also participated in the round. In January 2020, AMB's founders secured a $2.4M three-year research grant by the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC), based on its strong foundational academic progress.\n\nTo learn more about TDK Ventures, interested startups or investment partners should visit www.tdk-ventures.com or reach out at contact@tdk-ventures.com.\n\nAbout TDK Corporation\n\nTDK Corporation is a world leader in electronic solutions for the smart society based in Tokyo, Japan.

The growing concern for larger distance commuting using EV's will also boost the market.\n\nA major concern for EV users is the lower range of vehicle on a single charge. This issue has been a major factor reducing the growth of the EV market. Compared to EVs using conventional lithium ion batteries, those installed with solid-state batteries are expected to have a significantly higher range due to the high battery density.\n\nSolid-state batteries can theoretically store twice as much energy as that in lithium ion batteries. Thus, various top EV manufacturers are investing in this technology. An EV installed with a solid-state battery according to various industry experts can have an approximately 600+ mile electric range.\n\nPassenger Car Segment is expected to be the largest market in the vehicle type segment in the forecast.\n\nPassenger cars and a small part of commercial vehicles are considered under vehicle types in the automotive solid-state battery market due to the growing demand for premium electric cars. The demand for other electric cars and commercial vehicles using solid-state batteries will increase in the coming years once solid-state batteries are commercialized to be used in automobiles. Asia Pacific is expected to be the market for passenger cars, followed by Europe and North America.\n\nThis is due to the strong government support for the adoption of electric passenger vehicles in the region. North America to be the fastest-growing region with a fast-growing demand for premium electric vehicles which will use solid-state batteries in the coming years. The market in Europe is expected to grow in the coming years.\n\nThis is due to strong emission regulations and a variety of subsidies, grants, and incentives for adopting EVs in countries such as Germany, France, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the UK. The demand for solid-state batteries in electric vehicles will be growing with the increased demand for EVs and the mass production of automotive solid-state batteries.\n\nAsia is expected to be the largest market during the forecast period.\n\nThe Asia Pacific solid-state car battery market will be led by countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The governments of these countries have supported the growth of EV demand through subsidies, favorable policies for EVs and discouraging the use of petrol. This will lead to a fast-growing demand for solid-state car batteries in the region once they come into the market.\n\nPremium EVs using solid-state batteries will be launched in China and Japan, followed by South Korea and India. Growth will be slower in the initial years but will speed up after 2026. India will be the fastest-growing market in the region due to current and upcoming EV policies.\n\nJapan will also be one of the fastest-growing markets in the region due to top OEMs such as Toyota, Nissan, and Mitsubishi and battery manufacturers working to develop solid-state batteries.\n\nNorth America to be the fastest-growing region during the forecast period\n\nThe North American region is expected to achieve the highest growth for the solid-state car battery market. The market is expected to be led by sales of premium EVs in the US and Canada. Top OEMs such as GM and Ford are working with battery manufacturers to develop solid-state batteries for their EVs and plan to launch them in the coming years.

Zeng Yuqun, Huang Shilin, Pei Zhenhua and Li Ping, majority owners of CATL, boast a combined net worth of $61.6 billion with a green net worth clocking in at $60.7 billion.\n\nCATL has, of course, the iconic Palo Alto, California-based EV maker to mostly thank for its rise from a relatively obscure EV player to one of the most recognizable names in the space.\n\nLast year, the two companies inked a two-year supply deal making the Chinese company Tesla\u2019s third battery supplier after South Korea\u2019s LG Chem and Japan\u2019s Panasonic. In June, the two companies extended the supply deal until 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nInterestingly, these other two EV battery giants have also been enjoying impressive share gains in the current year. What sets CATL apart, though\u2014and the reason why its shares have performed better than its rivals\u2014is because it took Tesla\u2019s rallying call to its battery suppliers to ramp up their capacity seriously with CATL setting off a \u201ca blistering pace of expansion.\u201d\n\nGenerally, stocks of battery manufacturers have been enjoying solid gains while those of EV manufactures have languished because investors recognize that it\u2019s still early innings in the EV transition and it\u2019s, therefore, safer to bet on a wider electrification trend rather than betting more narrowly on EV brands.\n\nAs the world continues to navigate the fast-changing tech landscape, megatrend investing has emerged as the hottest investing theme in 2021. Megatrends are powerful, transformative secular trends that frequently bring about permanent changes in the world around us. For instance, the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV) invests in stocks of companies operating across the development of electric vehicles and\/or autonomous vehicles, including companies that produce electric\/hybrid vehicles, electric\/hybrid vehicle components and materials, autonomous driving technology, and network-connected services for transportation, collectively, autonomous and electric vehicle companies sectors. DRIV has outperformed most EV names with a 19.4% YTD gain.\n\nRelated: Shale Giants Hit Hard By Poor Hedging Decisions\n\nThat said, CATL is by no means the only EV battery manufacturer that\u2019s minting billionaires.\n\nLiu Jincheng, chairman at Eve Energy, another Chinese li-ion battery manufacturer, boasts a net worth of $10.9 billion and a similar green net worth. EVE supplies the likes of Daimler, BMW, and Xpeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV).\n\nOwners and founders of EV companies such as Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk still holds major sway in the EV space, though.\n\nWang Chuanfu, Lv Xiangyang, Xia Zuoquan-- have a combined net worth of $ 33.5 billion with a green net worth of$13.4 billion. These three Chinese investors are majority owners at BYD, an electric vehicle company that\u2019s currently converting Shenzhen\u2019s\u00a0fleet of buses, taxis, and trucks into electric vehicles. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) has owned BYD since 2008.\n\nMeanwhile, Li Bin, founder of Tencent-backed NIO Ltd (NYSE:NIO), by far the largest Chinese EV maker,\u00a0 boasts a net and green net worth of $9.1B.\n\nYou can find other billionaires who owe their massive wealth to the EV and green revolution on Bloomberg Green.\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nMerger Mania Paves The Way For A New Era In U.S. Shale  Could Oil Still Hit $80?

On the basis of applications, the study analyses the demand for battery materials from applications such as EVs, industrial and energy storage systems (ESS), consumer electronics, and others (medical & healthcare devices and portable tools).\n\nThe study quantifies the consumption of each of these material types on the basis of a robust methodology comprising an analysis of total Li-ion battery production, EV production volumes, uptake of the considered materials, and supply of those materials.\n\nAfter having registered a lackluster growth in 2019, the global EV sales registered a sharp surge (+35% y-o-y) in 2020. The global EV sales (BEVs and PHEVs) nearly quadrupled between 2016 and 2020. The global EV sales volume was estimated at nearly 3.1 Mn units for 2020. This is despite the raging pandemic, ensuing containment measures, and supply disruptions, and in sharp contrast with the internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales that plummeted by 14% in 2020.\n\nAs the demand gathers momentum and as more and more large global-scale battery facilities come online, production costs and average price are expected to register further declines, thereby inching closer to the coveted tipping point, where the gap between ICE vehicles and EVs disappears.\n\nOn the flip-side, while the global EV sales have been registering a robust growth, especially for the last 3 to 5 years, the bulk of the sales volume has been concentrated in the United States, China, and Western Europe. However, EVs currently available in countries such as India and Brazil are priced significantly higher than conventional mass-market ICE vehicles.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of a well-developed network of charging infrastructure in these regions is likely to continue to compound the impediments associated with the mass adoption of EVs, at least over the short term.\n\nThe continued push towards longer-range vehicles (and hence higher energy density batteries) entails a shift towards technologies based on higher nickel content cathode chemistry, partial replacement of graphite with silicon composites in anodes, the incorporation of functional additives in electrolytes, and increasing demand for thinner, high thermal resistance separators.\n\nWhile battery manufacturers are focusing on increasing capacity and reducing costs, a disruption in the supply of any of these crucial chemicals results in sky-rocketing prices and availability concerns, thereby disrupting the entire value chain. This is exacerbated by other diverse concerns ranging from ethical sourcing (artisanal or small-scale subsistence mining, child labor) to political instability in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)-the single largest supplier of cobalt.\n\nAccordingly, incumbents across the value chain, especially in Europe, are increasingly mandating the ethical sourcing of raw materials, reducing the use of critical materials, and developing processes and infrastructure for the recycling and end-of-life management for Li-ion batteries.\n\nThe publisher's analysis indicates that the global battery materials market is slated to register a robust double-digit growth of about 15.6% in terms of revenue between 2020 and 2027.\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n1.

(NASDAQ: AQMS) (\u201cAqua Metals\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), which is reinventing metals recycling with its AquaRefining\u2122 technology, today announced it has signed a definitive agreement with ACME Metal Enterprise Co., Ltd. (ACME) to deploy and license AquaRefining equipment at its facility in Keelung, Taiwan. While both companies signed a Letter of Intent (\u201cLOI\u201d) on July 1, 2021, that provided 60 days to reach a definitive agreement, the contract was signed in less than a month. The agreement includes terms for licensing to ACME and working with ACME to consider licensing AquaRefining to other parties in Taiwan. The agreement also defines a phased deployment of AquaRefining technology and provisions for ACME to work with Aqua Metals and one or more large battery manufacturers to develop a second methodology to produce oxide directly from AquaRefined material, which can significantly improve economic costs, safety, environmental impact and streamline the link between battery recycling and new battery manufacturing.\n\nACME currently refines lead bullion into lead alloys for sale to global battery manufacturers. These relationships will enable ACME to utilize AquaRefining as the only proven green method for recycling lead in the largest and fastest growing lead recycling market in the world. Aqua Metals intends to begin shipping Aqualyzers and supporting equipment to ACME during the next quarter for phase one of the deployment, which is expected to begin operating by the fourth quarter of 2021. The Aqualyzers will enable ACME to produce ultrapure lead metal in Taiwan with vastly improved emissions and worker safety. The partnership between Aqua Metals and ACME includes joint development of a process for converting the ultra-high purity AquaRefined briquettes into lead oxide utilizing a ball mill that ACME will have rights to throughout Taiwan. Aqua Metals announced in January 2021 that it had developed a process for converting briquettes into lead oxide through the Barton pot method (melting). With the addition of the ball mill process (grinding), AquaRefining will have the potential to produce oxide using the only two industry-standard processes available.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cACME\u2019s rapid progression from an LOI to a signed contract as our first licensee and a partner in developing the ball mill oxide process is a powerful vote of confidence for our patented AquaRefining process,\u201d stated Steve Cotton, Aqua Metals President and CEO. \u201cThe fact that we are the only commercially proven sustainable alternative to smelting for recycling lead has created a robust pipeline, and we are very busy working through additional global opportunities.\u201d\n\nLinus Lu, Managing Director, ACME Metal Enterprises Co., Ltd., added, \u201cWe are committed to leading the market as the first green lead recycler in Asia, and we know that this partnership with Aqua Metals puts us in a very competitive position. We are now uniquely qualified to expand our business with large battery manufacturers who understand the immediate need to embrace new innovations that drive towards net zero emissions and improve worker safety. We look forward to working with Aqua Metals to be a leader in transforming the lead recycling and battery manufacturing industry in Asia.\u201d\n\nThe specific financial terms of the agreement will remain proprietary for commercial and competitive reasons.\n\nConference Call and Webcast\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call to discuss this announcement and results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021, today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

The battery in question needs to reinforce the body structure and extend the driving range. Engineers refer to it as a structural battery that holds the promise of lighter weight and greater efficiency. The latest structural batteries are being developed by startups and legacy automakers alike, including the EV pioneer Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), General Motors Co (NYSE: GM), battery makers such as China's BYD Co Ltd and CATL.\n\nGeely Automobile Limited's (OTC: GELYF) Volvo Cars in late June revealed a new structural battery design it is developing with Swedish battery maker Northvolt that Volvo said should deliver 600 miles or more of travel between charges. To compare, Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ: TSLA) Model Y can deliver 326 miles.\n\nStructural Battery Technology- Still In Its Infancy\n\nManufacturers have not even settled on a standard approach. Our Next Energy, a one-year-old startup is developing a dual battery whose design contains structural cell-to-pack with a second high-energy pack capable of recharging the first pack, which should double the vehicle's range. Mujeeb Ijaz, founder and chief executive of the Novi, Michigan-based company is aiming to reinvent the battery completely,\n\nGM\n\nGM's approach revolves around the Ultium battery that begins with the basic building blocks, thin pouch-type battery cells, which are bundled into modules, then assembled into large packs. Ultium battery packs will be installed in the upcoming electric Hummer's chassis, stiffening its body, improving the quality of the ride and handling as it reduces vibration and harshness. At least this is how Josh Tavel, GM's executive chief engineer for battery-electric trucks, advertises it.\n\nChina\n\nChina's BYD and CATL have developed advanced batteries whose cells are assembled directly into large packs, eliminating the middle step. Both use lithium iron phosphate which is less expensive and less prone to fire hazards, while being friendlier to the environment compared to commonly used cobalt and nickel. However, LFP cells do not store as much energy compared to their nickel cobalt manganese or nickel cobalt aluminum counterparts. Due to a lower driving range they provide, a vehicle needs a larger and therefore, heavier, pack of lithium iron batteries to match the output provided by cobalt and nickel-based batteries.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk revealed a new type of structural battery last September during Tesla's Battery Day. The revolutionary battery is expected initially to power the Model Y with hundreds of large-format cylindrical cells bonded together with structural adhesive, then sandwiched between two metal sheets. Lithium-ion batteries both reduce the weight and address the range gap but automakers haven't gotten there yet to exploit these benefits.\n\nSolar Power\n\nWith the world's first electric pickup truck just around the corner, adding solar panels to tonneau covers seemed like the logical next step one that Worksport Ltd (OTC: WKSP) took first.\n\nThe eagerly anticipated Atlis XT electric pickup by Hercules Electric Mobility Inc. in partnership with Nissan Motors (OTC: NSANF) and Alpha Electric Pickup built by Atlis Motor Vehicles will be equipped with the TerraVis \u2122\n\nsolar fusion of cutting-edge solar power, storage, and delivery. This revolutionary tonneau cover consists of four monocrystalline foldable solar panels with an output that translates to a range of 12 to 15 miles or in practical terms, a bit less than a third of the power needed for an average daily commute under optimal conditions. The prototype will be fine-tuned under the umbrella of the specialized Ontario Tech University by the end of the year, with production expected to accelerate in 2022.\n\nBattery-Development Is Key\n\nAn all-electric future is no longer questionable. However, battery developments will ultimately decide the pace of the EV revolution.\n\nThis article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

He added that his company's dual-pack design is safer and more sustainable because it uses no nickel or cobalt, key ingredients in many current EV batteries.\n\nThe latest structural batteries are being developed by automakers from Tesla Inc to General Motors Co and battery makers such as China\u2019s BYD Co Ltd and CATL.\n\n\u201cIf they have a brain, that\u2019s the way to do it,\" said Michigan-based consultant Sandy Munro. \"It saves a lot of money and time and weight.\u201d\n\nDESIGN OPTIONS\n\nThere are many ways to design a structural battery. The research effort aimed at designing batteries that can reinforce a vehicle's body and chassis is going hand-in-hand with efforts to refine battery chemistry and reduce the cost of what goes inside the cells.\n\nStory continues\n\nGM\u2019s approach with its new Ultium battery starts with the basic building blocks - thin pouch-type battery cells, which are bundled into modules, then assembled into large packs. In the Hummer EV that is scheduled for launch later this year, the Ultium battery packs are installed in - and help stiffen - the vehicle\u2019s chassis. This, in turn, improves ride and handling while reducing vibration and harshness, according to Josh Tavel, GM's executive chief engineer for battery electric trucks.\n\nIn China, BYD and CATL have developed advanced batteries that eliminate the middle step of modules, enabling cells to be assembled directly into large packs.\n\nThe cathodes in both companies\u2019 battery cells use lithium iron phosphate (LFP), a chemistry whose basic materials are more plentiful, less expensive, less prone to fires, and less harmful to the environment than materials such as cobalt and nickel, which are more commonly used in EV battery cathodes.\n\nLFP cells, however, do not store as much energy as nickel cobalt manganese (NCM) or nickel cobalt aluminum (NCA) cells, and so they provide significantly less driving range between charges. That means a vehicle would require a larger, heavier pack of lithium iron batteries to match the output of batteries using cobalt and nickel.\n\nDesigning lithium ion batteries to beef up the vehicle's structure reduces weight and helps narrow the range gap.\n\nA new type of structural battery unveiled last September by Tesla CEO Elon Musk - expected initially to power the Model Y - bonds hundreds of large-format cylindrical cells together with structural adhesive, then sandwiches them between two metal sheets that are designed to attach to and help stiffen the body and chassis of the vehicle.\n\nIn comparison, ONE uses an array of metal-encased LFP battery cells called prismatics, bonded together in a pack with metal sides, top and bottom. The pack is then mounted in a vehicle chassis where it helps stiffen the vehicle structure.\n\nNot everyone thinks the cell-to-pack approach is a good idea.\n\nTony Aquila, CEO of electric vehicle startup Canoo Inc , said structural batteries make sense, but only if the cells are bundled first into modules. \"It has to be modular to be able to be repaired,\" he said.\n\nDaniel Barel, CEO of Israeli EV startup Ree, also believes cells should be bundled into modules for maximum flexibility. \"Unless you build the modules directly into the chassis, it doesn't make sense,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Paul Lienert and Ben Klayman in Detroit Editing by Matthew Lewis)","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/focus-next-step-evs-design-100000954.html","symbols":["GM.US","TSLA.US","TSLA34.SA"],"tags":["BATTERY CELLS","BATTERY MANUFACTURERS","EV BATTERIES","STRUCTURAL BATTERY","VEHICLE RANGE"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.934,"neg":0.012,"neu":0.947,"pos":0.041}},{"date":"2021-07-14T20:17:02+00:00","title":"Coventry Airport owner submits plans for huge gigafactory","content":"Electric cars\n\nCoventry is pulling ahead in the race to attract a developer to build a major new electric car battery plant, with plans pre-emptively submitted for approval for a major development at Coventry Airport.\n\nCoventry City Council and airport bosses hope that securing planning permission will make the site more attractive for battery manufacturers seeking a UK base as they seize on the boom in electric cars.\n\nNew large-scale battery facilities - known as gigafactories - are seen as key to the future of the UK's automotive sector as petrol and diesel engines are phased out.\n\nIt is particularly important for the West Midlands, an automotive heartland where major manufacturers Jaguar Land Rover, Aston Martin Lagonda and BMW employ thousands of people.\n\nWest Midlands mayor Andy Street said: \u201cIt is mission critical that the West Midlands secures a gigafactory, both for the future of our region\u2019s automotive industry and the huge economic and job benefits it would bring, as well as the future of our planet.\n\n\"I am therefore delighted that after years of collaborative work, we have now been able to reach this milestone moment of formally submitting a planning application for our preferred site.\"\n\nCoventry City Council and Coventry Airport have set up a joint venture to promote and prepare the site.\n\nThey have submitted outline proposals to Coventry City Council and Warwick District Council for a 5.7 million square foot factory for battery production and recycling.\n\nIt is understood the plans would allow for a factory capacity of up to 60GWh - bigger than Tesla's 50GWh factory in Berlin.\n\nWest Midlands also plans to bid for funding from a \u00a3500m UK Government pot available to help get gigafactories off the ground.\n\nJaguar Land Rover's Whitley plant is around two miles from the site and securing the company's interest would be a major coup for Coventry.\n\nHowever, JLR said yesterday it was \"exploring all options at this time to find the right position on the new value chain.

The price of lithium iron phosphate material has dropped sharply in recent two years, which provides sufficient space for reducing the cost of batteries in the raw material link. At present, the price of lithium iron phosphate material is 30,000 ~ 40,000 yuan\/ton, and it is expected that the price will drop to 25,000 ~ 35,000 yuan\/ton in the next two years.\r\n\r\nThe current application fields of lithium iron phosphate batteries include new energy vehicles, energy storage, electric ships and other power fields. Among them, the largest proportion of new energy vehicles is new energy commercial vehicles (including new energy buses and new energy special vehicles), and lithium iron phosphate batteries. The application ratio is very high; Lithium iron phosphate batteries currently used in the energy storage field account for more than 94%, including new batteries and ladder batteries, which are mainly used in UPS, backup power supply and communication energy storage; The future development of the electric ship market is expected to be good. Lithium iron phosphate batteries are all used in the electric ship field, and lithium iron phosphate batteries have also started to be used in the two-wheeled vehicle replacement market.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is a large market growth space for lithium iron batteries in the future, the living environment of lithium iron battery manufacturers is not optimistic. The main reasons are as follows: 1) The market share of lithium iron phosphate batteries on the vehicle side is increasingly concentrated, and small and medium-sized battery companies cannot participate in it; 2) In some scenarios of small power and energy storage, the main competitor of lithium iron battery is lead-acid battery, and the battery price is still the primary consideration of consumers. Under the pressure of cost reduction, the gross profit margin of batteries that meet the quality requirements cannot be guaranteed; 3) The technology of lithium iron battery and materials has entered the bottleneck period, the technical barriers are gradually reduced, and the market competition is fierce; 4) Subsidies decline, and the cost pressure of car companies is transmitted to the battery factory. The profit margin of enterprises in the upstream material link of iron and lithium is very small, so it is difficult to bear the cost reduction required by the battery factory, which leads to the increased cost pressure shared by the battery factory. For the above reasons, lithium iron phosphate battery enterprises still lack confidence in the future market trend.\r\n\r\nIn the future, lithium iron phosphate battery enterprises will present some new characteristics in terms of products, management, technology and channels, as follows:\r\n1) Battery-side sales are converted to operation to solve the problem of gross profit margin: in the application scenario where lead-acid batteries are competing products, the cycle life of lithium iron batteries is obviously excessive, and enterprises change the sales mode to lease operation, which will directly improve the life cycle economy of lithium iron batteries and improve the gross profit margin of products.\r\n2) The size of battery core products is gradually unified, and the demand for universality is enhanced: in downstream markets such as energy storage and shipping, the sales links are characterized by large fluctuations in demand, large number of items, but low single purchase amount, and the demand for generalization of square lithium iron batteries is enhanced, especially in communication energy storage and industrial energy storage, and modularization will help accelerate the application speed of downstream enterprises.\r\n3) The production of lithium iron phosphate materials will have the characteristics of bulk chemicals: with the trend of lowering the technical threshold, expanding the market scale and enriching the application scenarios in the lithium iron battery market, the product models are gradually unified, the sales price is further reduced, and the productivity and production scale of enterprises are further improved.\r\n4) With the increasing demand for channel construction, the platform and brand influence will become the complementary points of enterprises: energy storage, small power, ships and other fields have obvious regional characteristics, and the enterprises providing such batteries also have problems such as low concentration, large fluctuations in the number of enterprises, unsound procurement channels, etc. How to realize platform sales and create word-of-mouth effect for lithium iron phosphate materials enterprises will become an important issue in their sales and marketing links.\r\n5) Build factories in different places and arrange production according to the terminal demand: The electricity cost accounts for a relatively high proportion in the production cost of lithium iron phosphate materials. With Ningde era, BYD and other enterprises building factories in the central region, iron lithium materials enterprises can find a balance point suitable for their own development. At present, the electricity price in the central and western regions of China is low, and the base of chemical raw materials is perfect, which can support enterprises to complete capacity transfer.\r\n\r\nKey Topics Covered:\r\n\r\n1 Market analysis of lithium iron phosphate cathode materials\r\n\r\n2 Market analysis of lithium iron phosphate battery\r\n2.1 Lithium battery market analysis\r\n2.1.1 Analysis of the capacity scale of China's lithium battery market\r\n2.1.2 Product analysis of lithium battery market in China\r\n2.1.3 Market analysis of lithium iron phosphate battery in China\r\n2.1.4 China power lithium iron phosphate market analysis\r\n2.1.5 Market analysis of lithium iron phosphate battery for energy storage in China\r\n2.1.6 Analysis of the competitive pattern of China's lithium iron phosphate battery market\r\n2.2 Application status and characteristics of lithium iron phosphate battery\r\n2.2.1 Market application characteristics of lithium iron phosphate battery for vehicles\r\n2.2.2 Market application characteristics of marine lithium iron phosphate battery\r\n2.2.3 Market application characteristics of lithium iron phosphate battery for energy storage\r\n2.2.4 Other areas\r\n2.3 Analysis of the price development trend of lithium iron phosphate battery\r\n2.3.1 Analysis of the development trend of the cost of lithium iron phosphate battery for vehicles\r\n2.3.2 Analysis of the development trend of marine lithium iron phosphate battery cost\r\n2.3.3 Analysis of the cost development trend of lithium iron phosphate battery for energy storage\r\n2.3.4 Other areas\r\n2.4 Analysis of price trend and influencing factors of lithium iron phosphate battery\r\n2.5 Analysis of cost trend and influencing factors of lithium iron phosphate battery\r\n2.6 Technical requirements for lithium iron phosphate battery in subdivided fields\r\n2.7 Lithium iron phosphate battery technology development trend analysis\r\n2.4 Analysis of the impact of technological development on lithium iron phosphate battery market\r\n\r\n3.

(OTC: TLOFF) and Livent Corp (NYSE: LTHM) were among 30 EV and battery manufacturers, in addition to mining companies, who met virtually with the U.S. Department of Commerce on Thursday, according to a report by Reuters. The group discussed how to boost the production of Canadian battery materials. Canada currently mines 13 of the 35 minerals needed to produce EV batteries.\n\nWhy It Matters: Acquisitions have already begun. On Nov. 5, 2020, Livent, a lithium hydroxide supplier to Tesla, announced it had acquired the business and certain assets of Nemaska Lithium Inc., located in Quebec.\n\nThere are a number of other Canadian companies mining scarce battery minerals that U.S. companies could be looking to buy.\n\nGratomic Inc (OTC: CBULF), a Toronto-based graphite mining company, mines rare lump graphite at its Aukam Graphite Project, located in Namibia. The company plans to become the largest vein graphite producer in the world and to enter the EV battery supply chain.\n\nGratomic has a market cap of $69.82 million and trades at $1.15 a share.\n\nCanada Silver Cobalt Works Inc (OTC: CCWOF), based in Quebec, mines cobalt, silver, nickel and copper. The company announced on Feb. 16 it acquired 39,200 hectares, approximately 151 square miles, of property with deposits of minerals for EVs.\n\nCanada Silver Cobalt has a market cap of $42.32 million and trades at 35 cents per share.\n\nNeo Lithium Corp (OTC: NTTHF), based in Quebec, owns a 3Q project in Argentina, which is one of the five largest lithium brine deposits in the world.

That\u2019s seven times the total amount raised from 2018 to 2020, when the industry was in a downturn.\n\nInterest in the industry is resurgent as electric-vehicle targets set by global automakers and a change in the U.S. administration signal that a battery boom is finally gathering momentum. After the punishing three-year sell-off, prices of the soft silvery-white metal have started to rebound, and analysts including those at BloombergNEF expect further gains on rising demand and tight supplies of battery-grade lithium.\n\nTalks with investors and discussions on potential supply agreements with automotive-equipment and battery manufacturers \u201cwhich were only in my dreams a year ago are now filling my calendar,\u201d Robert Mintak, chief executive officer of Vancouver-based Standard Lithium Ltd., said by phone.\n\nA lithium price index compiled by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence jumped 32% this year through February, after plunging 59% from mid-2018 to mid-2020. The metal reached an all-time high in May 2018.\n\nThe investor pool \u201cis expanded to technology investors and others,\u201d said Mintak, as major automakers\u2019 determination to deploy hundreds of billions of dollars to electrify their fleets gives investors \u201cthat safety that there\u2019s going to be a supply pinch.\u201d\n\nThe majority of the financing has been done by the world\u2019s top two lithium miners -- Albemarle Corp. and SQM, or Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile SA, as it\u2019s known formally -- as they took advantage of their recent stock surges. Albemarle completed a larger-than-planned equity offering of $1.5 billion in early February, while Santiago-based SQM raised $1.1 billion in January.\n\nStory continues\n\nJunior miners, most of which have yet to produce substantial amount of lithium, are also attracting strong interest from investors. Take the case of Standard Lithium, which opened its first direct lithium extraction plant in El Dorado, Arkansas, in September, with the facility using a new technology that allows for a 90% lithium recovery rate. It raised C$34.53 million ($27.6 million) in an over-subscribed share offering in December. Investor interest was so strong that it had to turn away offers for more, said CEO Mintak.\n\nLithium Americas Corp., which is developing the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, raised a total of $500 million through two primary share offerings in October and January, respectively.\n\n\u201cThe tide is finally turning, and much faster than I thought,\u201d Chris Berry, president of House Mountain Partners, an industry consultant. \u201cYou see that with Lithium Americas being able to raise a total of half a billion dollars recently. This is for a pre-revenue company regarding lithium.\u201d\n\nSigma Lithium Resources Corp., which is developing a hard-rock lithium project in Brazil, had to upsize its private placement and increase offering price, which \u201csays a lot about investor demand for lithium exposure, that asset, and that company\u2019s vision,\u201d said Berry.\n\nJunior lithium miners raised $529 million this year, Bloomberg data showed. That\u2019s about $63 million more than the total amount raised from 2018 to 2020.\n\nFord Motor Co. announced last month that its passenger-vehicle range will be all-electric in Europe by 2030. General Motors Co. plans to sell only zero-emission models by 2035. Volkswagen AG went further, announcing plans this week to build six battery factories in Europe and invest globally in charging stations, as ensuring scaling battery production has become a key in the EV race.\n\nBatteries make up about 30% of an electric car\u2019s cost. And automakers around the world look to pivot to EVs, with hopes to get batteries at the cheapest price possible but also secure enough supply to meet those ambitions.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden has pledged to build back the economy after the devastation of Covid-19 with cleaner energy and a lower carbon footprint. The administration said in late February it would conduct a government review of U.S. supply chains to seek to end the country\u2019s reliance on China and other adversaries for crucial goods.\n\nThe election of Biden is \u201ca very favorable signal to investors\u201d as it boosted confidence that the switch to clean energy will accelerate, which along with existing favorable subsidies and regulations in Europe and China bodes well for raw materials needed for that energy transition, said Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. The U.S. is the second-largest EV market, after China.\n\nAndrew Bowering, a director at Vancouver-based American Lithium Corp., called the U.S. review on supply chains \u201chuge\u201d for the lithium industry as it shows the government\u2019s realization that in order to meet clean-energy goals, it\u2019s important for the U.S. to have a security of supply of raw materials such as lithium.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, after three years of downturn, you\u2019ve got the price of the commodity starting to go up again and a change in the administration in the U.S. that\u2019s pushing a green new deal and support big money going into the green automobile industry,\u201d said Bowering. \u201cThat leads investors into the space.\u201d\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/investors-flock-back-lithium-battery-180042849.html","symbols":["LAC.US"],"tags":["BATTERY MANUFACTURERS","BLOOMBERG","LITHIUM INDUSTRY","RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES","ROBERT MINTAK","STANDARD LITHIUM","SUPPLY AGREEMENTS"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.996,"neg":0.018,"neu":0.884,"pos":0.098}},{"date":"2021-03-15T12:30:23+00:00","title":"Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt receives a $14 billion order from VW","content":"Northvolt, the Swedish battery manufacturer which raised $1 billion in financing from investors led by Goldman Sachs and Volkswagen back in 2019, has signed a massive $14 billion battery order with VW for the next 10 years.\n\nThe big buy clears up some questions about where Volkswagen will be getting the batteries for its huge push into electric vehicles, which will see the automaker reach production capacity of 1.5 million electric vehicles by 2025.\n\nThe deal will not only see Northvolt become the strategic lead supplier for battery cells for Volkswagen Group in Europe, but will also involve the German automaker increasing its equity ownership of Northvolt.\n\nAs part of the partnership agreement, Northvolt's gigafactory in Sweden will be expanded and Northvolt agreed to sell its joint venture share in Salzgitter, Germany to Volkswagen as the car maker looks to build up its battery manufacturing efforts across Europe, the companies said.\n\nThe agreement between Northvolt and VW brings the Swedish battery maker's total contracts to $27 billion in the two years since it raised its big $1 billion cash haul.\n\n\"Volkswagen is a key investor, customer and partner on the journey ahead and we will continue to work hard with the goal of providing them with the greenest battery on the planet as they rapidly expand their fleet of electric vehicles,\" said Peter Carlsson, the co-founder and chief executive of Northvolt, in a statement.\n\nNorthvolt's other partners and customers include ABB, BMW Group, Scania, Siemens, Vattenfall, and Vestas. Together these firms comprise some of the largest manufacturers in Europe.\n\nBack in 2019, the company said that its cell manufacturing capacity could hit 16 Gigawatt hours and that it had sold its capacity to the tune of $13 billion through 2030. That means that the Volkswagen deal will eat up a significant portion of expanded product lines.\n\nFounded Carlsson, a former executive at Tesla, Northvolt's battery business was intended to leapfrog the European Union into direct competition with Asia's largest battery manufacturers -- Samsung, LG Chem, and CATL.\n\nStory continues\n\nBack when the company first announced its $1 billion investment round, Carlsson had said that Northvolt would need to build up to150 gigawatt hours of capacity to hit targets for. 2030 electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe plant in Sweden is expected to hit at least 32 gigawatt hours of production thanks, in part to backing by the Swedish pension fund firms AMF and Folksam and IKEA-linked IMAS Foundation, in addition to the big financial partners Volkswagen and Goldman Sachs.\n\nNorthvolt has had a busy few months. Earlier in March the company announced the acquisition of the Silicon Valley-based startup company Cuberg.\n\nThat acquisition gave Northvolt a foothold in the U.S. and established the company's advanced technology center.\n\nThe acquisition also gives Northvolt a window into the newest battery chemistry that's being touted as a savior for the industry -- lithium metal batteries.\n\nCuberg spun out of Stanford University back in 2015 to commercialize what the company called its next-generation battery combining a liquid electrolyte with a lithium metal anode. The company's customers include Boeing, BETA Technologies, Ampaire, and VoltAero and it was backed by Boeing HorizonX Ventures, Activate.org, the California Energy Commission, the Department of Energy and the TomKat Center at Stanford.\n\nCuberg's cells deliver 70 percent increased range and capacity versus comparable lithium ion cells designed for electric aviation applications. The two companies hope that they can apply the technology to Northvolt's automotive and industrial product portfolio with the ambition to industrialize cells in 2025 that exceed 1,000 Wh\/L, while meeting the full spectrum of automotive customer requirements, according to a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Cuberg team has shown exceptional ability to develop world-class technology, proven results and an outstanding customer base in a lean and efficient organization,\" said Peter Carlsson, CEO and Co-Founder, Northvolt in a statement. \"Combining these strengths with the capabilities and technology of Northvolt allows us to make significant improvements in both performance and safety while driving down cost even further for next-generation battery cells.

To be sure, not much has changed: we\u2019re still in the midst of a pandemic and look to be for a good portion of 2021. However, one thing is shifting: the rumblings of EV pushback are clear. And battery stocks will be a benefactor of this pushback.\n\nIt is my belief that EV stocks are going to remain hot through 2021. However, markets and capital are going to move into EV suppliers with more force. That means battery manufacturers and suppliers to these companies should become more attractive this year.\n\n8 Biometric Stocks to Consider as We Eye a Return to Normal\n\nThis list is focused on exactly that: EV battery manufacturers and suppliers thereto. Any and all of these stocks are a buy in my eyes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) Ganfeng Lithium (OTCMKTS:GNENF) Panasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) Romeo Power (NYSE:RMO) Vale (NYSE:VALE) Glencore (OTCMKTS:GLNCY)\n\nBattery Stocks: Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM) a lithium mine\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInvestors who have interest in EVs are likely well aware of lithium as a mineral integral to the sector. Lithium-ion battery chemistry has become the leading battery type used in the industry. Therefore, lots of lithium is necessary until a better suited chemistry is commercialized. The leading candidates don\u2019t look to be commercialized for some time yet. The upshot is lithium mining is a smart place to be for EV investment.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile and its SQM stock lead off this list. The Chilean company is a major producer of lithium. Lithium currently accounts for about 16% of Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile\u2019s profit and the company is making a major investment in increasing its lithium capacity.\n\nIt is clear that the company sees lithium as important to its immediate future. The company has four scheduled expansions through 2023. It is investing $240 million toward lithium production expansion, which will increase production by 69.5% by the second half of 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat means the company will go from the ability to produce 83.5 million tons of lithium to 141.5 million tons by the end of this year. The company is not stopping there. It intends to invest a further $150 million to bring total lithium capacity to 210 million tons by 2023. That 151.5% capacity increase is indicative of larger demand.\n\nThe company did experience a revenue decrease of 11% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. However, lithium sales volumes increased 40% between Q2 and Q3 making this a worthwhile play moving forward.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov\/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle is another major name in lithium production. It also experienced a sales decline and is positioning itself to take advantage of opportunities in lithium. Despite the downturn, ALB stock is definitely a smart play that makes sense in the EV space.\n\nThe company explains its overarching strategy thusly: \u201cOur long-term strategy and capital allocation priorities remain the same: to invest in lithium growth using cash flows from our entire enterprise, while maintaining our dividend and investment grade credit rating.\u201d\n\nAlbemarle depends on lithium for 37% of its total revenue currently and anticipates 20% industry growth. Albemarle experienced a sales decline of 19.6% in its lithium segment and 15.1% across its entire business in Q3 of 2020. The company says that while lithium market growth was stunted in 2020 that it still anticipates the same overall future growth.\n\n8 Biometric Stocks to Consider as We Eye a Return to Normal\n\nMy thesis is that it makes sense to invest now while revenue is relatively weakened and Wall Street views ALB stock as a \u201chold.\u201d Revenue may have slipped, but earnings well outpaced guidance for the quarter, and the company remains solidly entrenched in its lithium strategy.\n\nBattery Stocks: Ganfeng Lithium (GNENF) rows of lithium ion batteries\n\nSource: Lightboxx\/ShutterStock.com\n\nChina is a massive market for EVs. In fact, it\u2019s the world\u2019s largest by market share. But the country also has massive natural resources, which gives it another advantage when it comes to EVs. It has national champions including Nio (NYSE:NIO) and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV), and it has companies like Ganfeng Lithium which can supply them.\n\nThe company is headquartered in China and has operations in Australia, Argentina, Ireland and Mexico. Ganfeng Lithium is clearly well-diversified geographically. But it is also diversified in terms of its operations. It maintains lithium operations upstream, mid-stream and downstream, meaning it does everything from mining lithium to lithium battery manufacturing.\n\nNot only is the company massive, but it has also experienced robust growth. Ganfeng\u2019s CAGR averaged 41% between 2015 and 2019. Profitability growth decreased in 2019 although still a very healthy 16%. But it has begun to rise again in 2020.\n\nPanasonic (PCRFY) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing\/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe previous three stocks were all lithium producers. It is time to move up the value chain into the actual battery manufacturers. Most readers will recognize that Panasonic does many things. It is not a dedicated EV battery manufacturer by any stretch of the imagination. However, it does produce batteries for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). That alone makes it a name worth mentioning in this space. The simple fact is that to a degree, as Tesla goes, so goes the whole EV market.\n\nAnyway, the important consideration here for investors is the EV business between Panasonic and Tesla. Tesla has long been speculated to want to bring battery production in-house. But the long-time relationship it has had with Panasonic will continue through at least 2022.\n\n8 Biometric Stocks to Consider as We Eye a Return to Normal\n\nPanasonic is under pressure to increase energy storage capacity by Tesla. By 2025 its Model 3 battery is slated to have improved energy storage capacity by 20%. It is also under pressure to make similar leaps for the Tesla Model S and Model X.\n\nBattery Stocks: Romeo Power (RMO) A man holding two puzzle pieces surrounded by more, smaller puzzle pieces. SPAC IPOs\n\nSource: Pasuwan\/ShutterStock.com\n\nNow is the time to invest in Romeo Power. Prices have recently come down and now RMO stock\u2019s price point makes sense in addition to its strategic positioning. For an excellent run down of why Romeo Power is a bargain on a purely quantitative, objective basis, check out this article by InvestorPlace\u2019s Mark Hake. Numbers don\u2019t lie, and these numbers indicate that there is lots of upside in RMO shares.\n\nFrom a more subjective perspective there\u2019s also lots to like about Romeo Power. Most readers will know that many SPAC-funded EV companies came to market in 2020. Romeo Power is also a SPAC. But it is an EV supplier, not a manufacturer. The company makes battery packs for two segments: class 4-8 trucks and buses and high-performance vehicles, along with other commercial vehicles. EV battery manufacturing should continue to have many tailwinds as the decarbonization push shows little indication of slowing. EVs are here to stay.\n\nThe company has $544 million in contracted revenue, and another $2.2 billion possible under negotiation. So the $350 million it received at closing should be utilized to fulfill the sales it has booked. The company has an excellent chance to be the name behind truck electrification efforts underway at companies like Peterbilt (NASDAQ:PCAR) and Freightliner (OTCMKTS:DDAIF).\n\nRomeo Power has established relationships with 68% of the class 8 vehicle manufacturers in North America currently. They simply have to take SPAC funds and prove that their technology will effectively work for those companies. If they can, revenue will flow. That\u2019s why this stock makes so much sense at current prices.\n\nVale (VALE) the Vale (VALE) logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's webpage in the background\n\nSource: rafapress \/ Shutterstock.com\n\nLet\u2019s switch gears again and go back to the far upstream of the battery industry. The first three stocks on this list were all related to lithium used in the manufacturing of the batteries themselves. There\u2019s another mineral also very important in the battery manufacturing process: nickel. Nickel is set to receive high demand due to its utility in the EV battery manufacturing process. And on the supply side, there simply isn\u2019t enough nickel to satisfy that demand. In fact, there may be a 10-fold increase in demand between 2018 and 2025.\n\n8 Biometric Stocks to Consider as We Eye a Return to Normal\n\nThe calculus is simple: produce and supply that nickel and make great profits. Vale increased its sales of nickel by 37.3% in Q3 of 2020. VALE stock is rated a \u201cbuy\u201d and shares are currently less than $20, making it an attractive play in EV batteries. It is probably the strongest play in battery stocks as it relates to nickel in production.\n\nBattery Stocks: Glencore (GLNCY) a group of connected batteries\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLast but not least on this list of battery stocks is Glencore. Like Vale, it is included because of its focus on nickel production. The company produces nickel in Asia, Australia, North America and Europe. In Q3 Glencore experienced a 9% decrease in nickel production as a result of operational restrictions due to Covid-19 at its Koniambo plant in New Caledonia. The company produced 81,800 tons of nickel in the period.\n\nPrices have remained basically steady in the past two years for nickel, according to the company, but Glencore will have plenty of opportunity to sell to EV battery manufacturers as long as it can produce the metal.\n\nGlencore is diversified across mineral and metals mining. It is also relatively cheap at less than $10 per share. The company is well funded and in position to serve EV battery manufacturers, as well as many other downstream companies across many industries. GLNCY stock is cheap with a lot of upside and worth a look.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nAlex Sirois is a freelance contributor to InvestorPlace whose personal stock investing style is focused on long-term, buy-and-hold, wealth-building stock picks.
