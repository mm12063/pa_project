Tianqi Lithium had marketed the shares at HK$69 to HK$82 each.\n\nA representative for Tianqi Lithium didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe share sale breaks a months-long drought for large offerings in Hong Kong, where funds raised between January and June fell more 90% from the previous year. The city has been hit even harder by the global slump than other trading hubs, as central banks move to combat surging inflation and spikes in volatility have put issuers on the sidelines.\n\nAs virus-related curbs in China ease and the country\u2019s equities recover both at home and abroad, a successful listing by Tianqi Lithium could open the window for a pickup in Hong Kong offerings. China Tourism Group Duty Free Corp., which is traded in Shanghai, is set to relaunch a Hong Kong listing that could raise around $2 billion to $3 billion as soon as in the third quarter.\n\nTracing its history to the construction of its first lithium carbonate plant in 1992, Tianqi Lithium mines lithium in Australia and produces lithium compounds and derivatives in China, a prospectus shows. The Chengdu-based company raised 735 million yuan ($110 million) in a Shenzhen initial public offering in 2010.\n\nStory continues\n\nTianqi Lithium sold a 49% stake in its Australian unit in 2020 to Perth-based IGO Ltd. for $1.4 billion to help repay an acquisition loan. The Kwinana lithium refinery near Perth, Australia -- a joint venture between the company and IGO and the first lithium refinery outside China -- delivered its first batch of battery-grade lithium hydroxide in May.\n\nThe share sale has drawn seven cornerstone investors that are set to snap up about 38% of the listing, the prospectus shows. Morgan Stanley, China International Capital Corp. and CMB International Capital Ltd. are joint sponsors of the offering.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Lottery Lawyer Won Their Trust, Then Lost Their Mega Millions Google Is Going to Let Politicians Spam Your Inbox Geely Is Launching Satellites in a Bid to Bring Driverless Cars to China Gangs Are Fake-Killing People in India for Insurance Payouts Did Razzlekhan and Dutch Pull Off History\u2019s Biggest Crypto Heist?\n\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/tianqi-lithium-raises-1-7-100734705.html","symbols":["002466.SHE"],"tags":["BLOOMBERG","HONG KONG","LITHIUM CARBONATE","TIANQI LITHIUM"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.859,"neg":0.047,"neu":0.885,"pos":0.069}},{"date":"2022-07-05T13:22:42+00:00","title":"China Cracks Down On Critical Tesla, BMW Supplier: Report","content":"China Securities Regulatory Commission probed\u00a0Ganfeng Lithium Co Ltd (OTC: GNENY) for alleged insider trading for buying and selling a mainland-listed stock in the secondary market, the Financial Times reports. Ganfeng Lithium received a case filing from the regulator on July 1. Ganfeng Lithium did not expect the investigation to impact its \"normal production and business activities,\" and it vowed to \"actively co-operate\" with investigators, FT noted. The probe comes as Ganfeng Lithium and other leading Chinese resource mining and processing groups solemnize state-backed efforts to consolidate China's dominance over the supply chain for electric vehicles and batteries. Ganfeng Lithium is a leading Chinese biggest lithium producer and a critical\u00a0Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (OTC: BMWYY) supplier. Ganfeng Lithium battled volatility amid fluctuating lithium carbonate prices and China's pandemic lockdowns disrupting supply chains. The nationalization of the lithium industry also posed concerns over Ganfeng Lithium's assets in Mexico. Analysts expect the Sonora project in Mexico to account for about 5% - 8% of Ganfeng's total lithium output by 2025, remaining upbeat about the prospects of the\u00a0Chinese electric vehicle industry. Analysts and investors saw immense growth potential as rival carmakers overhauled their business models to focus on electric cars, whose batteries rely on lithium.

The MOU also includes an option for Compass Minerals to supply up to an additional 40% annually of the company\u2019s phase-two production once the project is at full scale. The company has previously announced an expected annual commercial production capacity of 30 kMT to 40 kMT lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) for the project, with an initial phase-one capacity of up to 10 kMT LCE coming online by 2025. As outlined in the MOU, purchase pricing would be based on market price and sales volume thresholds would be dependent upon product qualifications.\n\n\"Our lithium vision is to support the North American battery market by accelerating the development of a sustainable and secure domestic lithium supply chain,\" said Chris Yandell, head of lithium for Compass Minerals. \"Entering into this commercial relationship with a proven manufacturing leader like LGES will help enable that vision, as well as assist LGES in solidifying its U.S. supply chain.\"\n\nAs previously announced, Compass Minerals is pursuing the sustainable development of an approximately 2.4 mMT LCE resource on the Great Salt Lake, readily available for extraction through existing permits, water rights and operational infrastructure at the company\u2019s Ogden facility, the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\"Securing key raw materials has become critically important, in order to maintain our lead position in the global battery market,\" said Dongsoo Kim, senior vice president of procurement center at LG Energy Solution. \"We believe partnering up with Compass Minerals will aid in achieving that goal while solidifying supply chain in the U.S.\"\n\nCompass Minerals will continue good-faith negotiations with LGES toward a binding supply agreement as part of the company\u2019s broader lithium project commercial offtake strategy.\n\nAbout Compass Minerals\n\nCompass Minerals (NYSE: CMP) is a leading global provider of essential minerals focused on safely delivering where and when it matters to help solve nature\u2019s challenges for customers and communities. The company\u2019s salt products help keep roadways safe during winter weather and are used in numerous other consumer, industrial, chemical and agricultural applications. Its plant nutrition products help improve the quality and yield of crops, while supporting sustainable agriculture. Additionally, the company is pursuing development of a sustainable lithium brine resource to support the North American battery market and is a minority owner of Fortress North America, a next-generation fire retardant company. Compass Minerals operates 12 production and packaging facilities with nearly 2,000 employees throughout the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Visit compassminerals.com for more information about the company and its products.\n\nForward Looking Statements and Other Disclaimers\n\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements about the company's lithium development project, including its expected production capacity, vision, sustainability, and the potential execution and terms of any binding supply agreement. These statements are based on the company\u2019s current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially. The differences could be caused by a number of factors including those factors identified in the \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" sections of the company\u2019s Transitional and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-KT and 10-Q, as well as the company\u2019s other SEC filings. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this press release to reflect future events or developments, except as required by law.\n\nThe company has completed an initial assessment to define the lithium resource at Compass Minerals\u2019 existing operations in accordance with applicable SEC regulations, including Subpart 1300. Pursuant to Subpart 1300, mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. The company\u2019s mineral resource estimates, including estimates of the lithium resource, are based on many factors, including assumptions regarding extraction rates and duration of mining operations, and the quality of in-place resources. For example, the process technology for commercial extraction of lithium from brines with low lithium and high impurity (primarily magnesium) is still developing. Accordingly, there is no certainty that all or any part of the lithium mineral resource identified by the company\u2019s initial assessment will be converted into an economically extractable mineral reserve.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20220628006192\/en\/\n\nContacts\n\nMedia Contact Rick Axthelm\r\nChief Public Affairs and Sustainability Officer\r\n+1.913.344.9198\r\nMediaRelations@compassminerals.com\n\nInvestor Contact Douglas Kris\r\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\r\n+1.917.797.4967\r\nkrisd@compassminerals.com","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/compass-minerals-signs-non-binding-120000849.html","symbols":["CMP.US","PAEEX.US"],"tags":["COMPASS MINERALS","DEVELOPMENT PROJECT","LEADING GLOBAL PROVIDER","LGES","LITHIUM CARBONATE","MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING","PRODUCTION CAPACITY","SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.995,"neg":0.02,"neu":0.883,"pos":0.098}},{"date":"2022-06-27T11:45:33+00:00","title":"7 Top Lithium Stocks for the Second Half of 2022","content":"Goldman Sachs just made lithium stocks even more attractive.\n\nJust days ago, the firm said that lithium prices could fall about 10% this year, and as much as 73% next year. But they\u2019re wrong. \u00a0For one, as noted by Bloomberg, \u201cBenchmark disputes Goldman\u2019s forecast that a flood of new production is on its way, and that prices will crater as a result.\u201d\u00a0Benchmark also says the lithium market will remain short until 2025.\n\nMoreover, Bloomberg also noted that \u201cMatt Fernley, the London-based managing director at Battery Materials Review, an industry researcher, said the sell side reports are \u2018massively over-estimating\u2019 the ease of adding new supply, and failing to consider the complexity of bringing new assets into production and the qualification requirements.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeanwhile, Time Magazine contributor Emily Barone added that \u201c[w]hile the Earth has plenty of lithium to go around, the supply needs to be extracted from brine pools and underground reserves, and current mining operations aren\u2019t sufficient to keep up with the auto industry\u2019s growing needs.\u201d\n\nSo, if you believe lithium prices are coming down soon, I have a bridge to sell you. With significant demand and little supply, prices won\u2019t come down soon. I\u2019m honestly not sure what Goldman Sachs was thinking. But we should thank the firm for making lithium stocks even more attractive than before.\n\n7 Retirement Stocks to Buy in Unexpected Sectors\n\nTherefore, let\u2019s take a closer look at seven lithium stocks for investors to consider right now.\n\nTicker Company Price LAC Lithium Americas $21.82 SLI Standard Lithium $4.71 LTHM Livent Corp. $24.25 LIT Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF $75.80 BATT Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF $15.36 ALB Albemarle Corp. $224.79 PLL Piedmont Lithium $41.64\n\nLithium Stocks: Lithium Americas (LAC) Mobile phone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp\n\nSource: T. Schneider \/ Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the past month, Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) stock has fallen more than 13% to just under $22 per share, where it\u2019s now oversold.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, from current prices, I\u2019d like to see it rally back to about $32 in the long term. Helping the cause is the fact that at its Thacker Pass mine, results of a Feasibility Study on the first phase of Thacker Pass now expects an an increased initial capacity of 40,000 tpa of lithium carbonate. This is up from the previously expected figure of at least 30,000-35,000 tpa of lithium carbonate.\n\nAlso, in April, Deutsche Bank analyst Corinne Blanchar raised the firm\u2019s price target to $40 from $34, with a \u201cBuy\u201d rating. She believes lithium producers are well positioned with pricing improving. And with all of this combined, LAC stock looks like one of the top lithium stocks to consider.\n\nStandard Lithium (SLI) Graphic of Lithium scientific symbol (Li) in the shape of a big white gear with construction equipment and mountain around it\n\nSource: GrAl \/ Shutterstock.com\n\nSince the beginning of June, Standard Lithium (NYSEAMERICAN:SLI) slipped from just above $6 to now sitting at $4.71 per share. That said, from current prices, I\u2019d like to see the stock retest $5.50 in the near term.\n\nAt the moment, Standard Lithium is working on a 3.14 tonne LCE Indicated Resource, a 150,000-acre joint venture Lanxess Project in Arkansas. \u201cThe region is home to North America\u2019s largest brine production fairway with over five decades of commercial production, significant infrastructure, abundant low-cost electricity, access to chemical reagents and water sources. The project is already permitted for extensive brine extraction and processing activities,\u201d the company said.\n\nFurthermore, in the past seven month, three analsysts have reiterated \u201cBuy\u201d ratings on SLI stock. In terms of price targets, the trio of analysts\u2019 estimates range from a low of 13 CAD per share and 14.28 CAD per share.\n\nShould You Buy Apple Stock? Two Key Issues to Consider\n\nThus, investors should pay closer attention to SLI stock moving forward.\n\nLithium Stocks: Livent Corp. (LTHM) Livent Corporation logo on a phone screen. LTHM stock.\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold \/ Shutterstock\n\nAnother solid lithium stock to consider is Livent Corp. (NYSE:LTHM), a pure play lithium producer. After dropping from about $34.61 at the end of May to a low of $21.71, LTHM stock became oversold. That said, from current prices, I\u2019d like to see the stock retest at least $31 per share in the near term.\n\nRight now, the company has 16 offices or manufacturing facilities across the world \u2014 including its \u201clargest and most diverse manufacturing facility\u201d in North Carolina. It will also soon start phase two of its carbonate expansion in Argentina, with commercial production expected to begin by 2023.\n\nFurthermore, earnings are impressive, too. For the first quarter of 2022, company revenues were up 17% quarter-over-quarter (QOQ) to $143.5 million. Year-over-year (YOY), revenue was up 56%. Also, GAAP net income was 609% higher quarter over quarter at $53.2 million.\n\nIn other words, this is a strong company in a growing industry. And that could mean good things for investors looking for lithium stocks to buy.\n\nGlobal X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) a pile of lithium\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich\/ShutterStock.com\n\nOne of my favorite ways to trade any hot sector is with an ETF, such as the Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:LIT).\n\nNot only does this ETF offer great diversification, but it also does so at a lower cost. At $75.62 per share, and with an expense ratio of 0.75%, the LIT ETF offers exposure to stocks, such as Albemarle (NYSE:ALB), BYD Co. (OTC:BYDDY), LG Chem (OTC:LGCLF), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Livent Corp., Lithium Americas Corp., Quantumscape Corp. (NYSE:QS) and Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) to name a few.\n\n7 Red-Hot Growth Stocks That Will Outrun a Recession\n\nAfter slipping from about $80 back in early April to its current levels, I\u2019d like to see the LIT ETF eventually retest $79 in the near term. At a lower price now, though, investors could take advantage.\n\nLithium Stocks: Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT) a lithium ion battery\n\nSource: Olivier Le Moal\/ShutterStock.com\n\nAnother solid ETF to consider is the AmplifyAdvanced Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:BATT).\n\nAt $15.33, with an expense ratio of 0.59%, BATT offers exposure to companies involved in battery storage, battery metals and materials and EVs. Some of its top holdings include Tesla, Glencore PLC (OTCMKTS:GLNCY), Nio Inc. (NYSE:NIO), Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) and LG Chem to name a few.\n\nSince early June, the ETF slipped from about $16 per share to $14.19 per share. From here, I\u2019d like to eventually see the BATT ETF retest a $18 high from early April.\n\nAlbemarle Corp. (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov\/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle, the 800 lb. gorilla in the lithium space, has been beaten silly. Since topping out around $273, ALB stock dropped to a low of $198. Now, it\u2019s technically oversold and may be overdue for a pivot higher. And from current prices, I\u2019d like to see ALB retest $270 shortly.\n\nIn May, the company boosted its guidance for the second time for the full year. It now expects 2022 sales to come in between $5.8 billion and $6.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to come in between $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion. And adjusted earnings per share (EPS) is expected to fall in between a range of $12.30 and $15.\n\n\u201cOver the past 12 months, we\u2019ve made significant progress in renegotiating more variable-priced contracts with our lithium customers. Implementation of these contracts is a key driver of the expected year-over-year improvement in our financial results,\u201d CEO Kent Masters said. \u201cWe now expect full-year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be up more than 160% from prior year based on favorable market dynamics for our Lithium and Bromine businesses.\u201d\n\n7 Stock Bargains Worth a Look After the Most Recent Pullback\n\nOverall, this is a great sign for Albemarle. And thus, is a good sign for ALB stock investors, as well as potential investors of lithium stocks.\n\nLithium Stocks: Piedmont Lithium (PLL) a lithium mine\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPiedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) fell from a high of about $67.50 to $47.50, where it\u2019s starting to pivot higher.

(\u201cAmerican Lithium\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX-V:LI | OTCQB:LIACF | Frankfurt:5LA1) is pleased to announce the successful precipitation of high purity, fertilizer-quality potassium sulfate (\u201cSOP\u201d-sulfate of potash) by-product from the Company\u2019s Falchani Project. Testing confirms that in addition to producing high quality lithium compounds, SOP can be produced to potentially supply Peru with its domestic needs. Testing was completed at Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (\u201cANSTO\u201d) Minerals Business Unit laboratories in Sydney, Australia. The SOP produced by ANSTO from Falchani mineralization is 45% potassium (\u201cK\u201d) and 20% sulfur (\u201cS\u201d) and falls within the specification parameters of SOP marketed by various producers and traders of K-based fertilizers.\n\nHighlights:\n\nANSTO\u2019s work to date validates the ability to produce high quality SOP at Falchani, while continuing to refine flowsheet options and realizing the lithium and by-product value contained within the deposit. As part of the SOP production validation test work, the cesium and rubidium extracted in the upfront acid leach have been separated from lithium and work is on-going to realize the significance of these two critical elements. Once all by-products are validated, ANSTO will optimize the Falchani flow sheet to maximize the precipitation of lithium carbonate while enabling significant by-product production. The existing Falchani PEA will be updated for these by-products and associated revenue implications. Recent shortages of fertilizers in Peru, with imports of SOP rising to over 60,000 tonnes per year, highlight the strategic importance of developing significant domestic sources of supply.\n\nDr. Laurence Stefan, COO of American Lithium, states, \u201cThe strategic importance of the ability to produce significant amounts of SOP from Falchani cannot be overstated. This by-product will not only provide an additional potential revenue stream at Falchani, but more importantly will also provide a major source of domestic SOP for Peru with the potential to largely reduce the country\u2019s dependence on imported overseas fertilizers. Falchani has the potential to ultimately make Peru self-sufficient for the SOP fertilizers required to produce the high-value crops, fruit and vegetables that are major exports for Peru. At the same time, the Company continues to refine its flowsheet to maximize its ability to extract Cesium and Rubidium, also critical minerals and potential by-products to further enhance the Falchani project.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe current test work program at ANSTO builds on previous programs which have demonstrated the ability to produce battery grade lithium carbonate from the Falchani mineralization. This latest program has pursued to modify the baseline flowsheet to allow the recovery of SOP, and cesium and rubidium by-products.\n\nThe definition of the SOP, and cesium and rubidium recovery circuits has been performed with a ~20 kg sample of representative \/ bulk Falchani feed material. In the baseline flowsheet for Falchani, potassium alum is crystallized from the resultant pregnant leach solution (PLS). This potassium alum is the feed material for the SOP, and cesium and rubidium recovery circuits and does not impact the downstream purification and lithium carbonate precipitation circuits.\n\nTable 1 - ANSTO Minerals Table of Analyses for Basic and Refined SOP Element Basic K product (wt%)\r\n(1st pass SOP) Refined K product (wt%)\r\n(2nd pass SOP) Al 0.04 <0.01 Ca <0.01 <0.01 Fe <0.01 <0.01 Li <0.01 <0.01 Na <0.04 <0.01 Ni <0.01 <0.01 P <0.01 <0.01 S 20 20 Si <0.05 <0.05 Zn <0.01 <0.01 K 45 45 Rb 0.62 0.16 Cs <0.01 <0.01 Rb\/K (%) 1.4 0.35 Cs\/K (%) <0.02 <0.02 Cs\/Rb (%) <1.7 <6.5\n\nAbout Peru SOP requirements & Falchani Potential\r\nPeru imports the entire amount of SOP needed for its agricultural sector, mainly for high-value crops that play a very important role in the balance of Peruvian agricultural exports. The fertilizer crisis generated by the war in Ukraine has exacerbated shortages in the fertilizer market, its transport, distribution and increased fertilizer prices to unprecedented levels and is linked to accelerating the sharp price increase of fruit, vegetables, livestock feed etc., in the country. The large amounts of SOP that American Lithium could potentially produce from Falchani could cover the SOP needs of Peru when compared with pre-pandemic requirements, with the possibility of Peru becoming a net fertilizer exporter at full capacity.\n\nQualified Person\r\nMr. Ted O\u2019Connor, P.Geo., a Director of American Lithium, and a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, has reviewed and approved the scientific and technical information contained in this news release.\n\nCompletion of Acquisition of Highly Prospective concessions near Falchani in Southern Peru \r\nThe Company has also completed its recently announced acquisition of additional highly prospective concessions (14,243 hectares) in Southern Peru near to its existing Projects. In consideration for the additional concessions, the Company has paid US$400,000 and issued 2,250,000 common shares to an arms-length vendor. The shares issued are subject to restrictions on resale until October 22, 2022 in accordance with applicable securities laws.\n\nAbout ANSTO Minerals\r\nANSTO Minerals is an international mining consultancy group located in Sydney, Australia, with an experienced team of 60+ engineers, metallurgists, chemists, and scientists who have been providing consulting services and process development services to the mining and minerals processing industries for well over 35 years.

Investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Cautionary Note Regarding Macusani Concessions Thirty-two of the 151 concessions held by American Lithium\u2019s subsidiary Macusani, are currently subject to Administrative and Judicial processes (together, the \u201cProcesses\u201d) in Peru to overturn resolutions issued by INGEMMET and the Mining Council of MINEM in February 2019 and July 2019, respectively, which declared Macusani\u2019s title to 32 of the concessions invalid due to late receipt of the annual validity payments. In November 2019, Macusani applied for injunctive relief on 32 concessions in a Court in Lima, Peru and was successful in obtaining such an injunction on 17 of the concessions including three of the four concessions included in the Macusani Uranium Project PEA. The grant of the Precautionary Measure (Medida Cautelar) has restored the title, rights and validity of those 17 concessions to Macusani until a final decision is obtained at the last stage of the judicial process. A Precautionary Measure application was made at the same time for the remaining 15 concessions and was ultimately granted by a Court in Lima, Peru on March 2, 2021 which has also restored the title, rights and validity of those 15 remaining concessions to Macusani, with the result being that all 32 concessions are now protected by Precautionary Measure (Medida Cautelar) until a final decision on this matter is obtained at the last stage of the judicial process. The favourable judge\u2019s ruling confirming title to all 32 concessions from November 3, 2021 represents the final stage of the current judicial process. However, this ruling has recently been appealed by MINEM and INGEMMET. American Lithium has no assurance that the outcome of these appeals will be in the Company\u2019s favour.","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/american-lithium-validates-sulfate-potash-110000476.html","symbols":["5LA1.F","LI.V","LIACF.US"],"tags":["AMERICAN LITHIUM","AMERICAN LITHIUM CORP","ANSTO","LITHIUM","LITHIUM CARBONATE","PERU","SOP","THE COMPANY"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.996,"neg":0.058,"neu":0.853,"pos":0.089}},{"date":"2022-06-23T23:00:00+00:00","title":"Will Soaring Lithium Prices Spark Demand Destruction?","content":"While everyone has been watching the price of oil and how high it might go, one other commodity that is now considered critical for our future has been on a much stronger rally.\n\nLast year, lithium prices rose by some 400 percent and are still rising. Some analysts expect them to peak this year, but with supply slow to respond to robust demand, that peak is far from certain. And this may slow down the energy transition that many governments are eager to help along.\n\nTesla has raised the prices of its car severaltimes since the start of the year. While the company does not normally announce reasons for the price hikes, CEO Elon Musk this month complained about raw material prices and supply chain shortages.\n\nIn an interview with a Tesla owners group, Musk said, \"Both Berlin and Austin factories are gigantic money furnaces right now,\" adding that he was worried about how Tesla would keep these factories running without going bankrupt.\n\nRaw material inflation is ubiquitous right now, but in some commodities, it is a lot more pronounced, and lithium is one of them. According to a Wall Street Journal report from this week, one big reason may be the pricing model for lithium.\n\nSpot prices for the most popular forms of lithium\u2014lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide\u2014have risen fivefold over the past 12 months, the WSJ's Stephen Wilmot wrote. Yet this has not attracted as much attention as the oil price rally, which, in absolute terms, was a lot more modest, because there isn't much of a spot market for lithium. And this, Wilmot argued, may be part of the reason why lithium producers are not in a rush to boost supply in response to strong demand from EV makers.\n\nNow, most lithium is sold directly by producers to consumers such as carmakers at fixed prices far below those on the spot market, Wilmot explains, but a growing number of contracts are now being indexed to the lithium spot market to reflect differences in volumes or in quality. The next step: a futures market.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated: Russian Refinery On Fire After Kamikaze Drone Strike\n\nA futures market would mean lithium trading has evolved and matured. It would mean there is enough stable demand for lithium to ensure future purchases in volumes big enough to merit mining expansions and new developments, theoretically. Yet a futures market would also need benchmarks, and this may be tricky. Because the biggest lithium market right now is China.\n\nThere is also the factor of time. Mature markets do not happen overnight, even when demand for the commodity\u2014or specialty chemical, as Albermarle, for instance, likes to call lithium\u2014is as great as the demand for lithium right now. And then, it will take time for supply to catch up after that market evolves.\n\nGoldman Sachs last month sparked outrage by calling an end to the bull market in lithium, saying that there has been a \"fundamental mispricing [that] has in turn generated an outsized supply response well ahead of the demand trend.\"\u00a0In other words, Goldman is arguing that supply is already greater than demand.\n\nNaturally, this prompted reactions, among them a note by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a firm that tracks and reports specifically on battery minerals. Among fundamental reasons, such as quality issues with much of the available lithium and geological challenges for new supply, Benchmark also made a note about prices.\n\n\"There is no single lithium price,\" the agency wrote this month, as quoted by Mining.com, explaining that the fact most lithium trading is done under fixed contracts while there's a spot market operating in parallel means it will be a while before spot prices and fixed-term prices begin to converge.\u00a0Until that happens, the imbalance between supply and demand will likely remain considerable.\n\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nChina May No Longer Be A Pillar Of Growth For Global Oil Markets  4 Nations That Could Help Solve The Global Fuel Crisis  Europe Faces \u201cRed Alert\u201d For Gas Supply As Russia Reduces Flows\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/soaring-lithium-prices-spark-demand-230000387.html","symbols":["TL0.F","TL0.XETRA","TSLA.MX","TSLA.US","TSLA34.SA"],"tags":["FUTURES MARKET","LITHIUM CARBONATE","LITHIUM HYDROXIDE","SPOT MARKET","SPOT PRICES","STEPHEN WILMOT"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.989,"neg":0.065,"neu":0.826,"pos":0.109}},{"date":"2022-06-23T11:55:00+00:00","title":"Imperial and E3 Lithium form strategic agreement on lithium pilot project in Alberta","content":"Advances E3 Lithium\u2019s Clearwater Project with Imperial funding contribution Pilot project progresses commercialization of battery-grade lithium from historic Leduc field for electric vehicles and energy storage Imperial to provide technical and development support\n\nCALGARY, Alberta, June 23, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Imperial Oil Limited (TSE: IMO, NYSE American: IMO) and E3 Lithium (TSXV: ETMC, OTCQX: EEMMF) announced today a collaboration to advance a lithium-extraction pilot in Alberta, exploring the redevelopment of an historic oil field into a potential new leading source of lithium for Canada\u2019s growing critical minerals industry.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20220623005337\/en\/\n\nThe pilot will support E3 Lithium\u2019s Clearwater project, which will draw lithium from under the Leduc oil field, Imperial\u2019s historic discovery that first launched major oil and gas development in Western Canada. E3 Lithium\u2019s proprietary technology is designed to extract the critical mineral from the lithium-rich brine, with potential for commercial development of battery-grade products.\n\n\"This exciting collaboration brings together Imperial\u2019s long-standing commitment to research and technology to help test and scale E3\u2019s lithium-recovery technology,\" said Jason Iwanika, director of commercial business development at Imperial. \"We continue to advance the innovation and technologies needed to support the energy transition, working in collaboration with governments and industry to progress new opportunities from existing assets and sector expertise.\"\n\n\"E3 Lithium and Imperial share an interest in the diversification of the Alberta economy, local job creation and sustainability,\" said Chris Doornbos, CEO of E3 Lithium. \"Leduc No.1, Imperial\u2019s first well into this reservoir, was one of Imperial\u2019s most prolific oil discoveries in Alberta and transformed the provincial and Canadian economies, much like lithium has the potential to do. Having Imperial now working with E3 Lithium in exploring the redevelopment of Leduc into a world-class source of lithium is an exciting new chapter in Alberta and Canada\u2019s story.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe pilot project includes drilling Alberta\u2019s first lithium evaluation wells, planned to be completed by the end of the third quarter of this year. Work will also focus on scaling up E3 Lithium\u2019s proprietary technology, which brings the brine liquid to the surface where the lithium is removed and concentrated. This liquid is immediately returned underground as part of a closed-loop system. E3 Lithium\u2019s PEA1 estimates the first phase of development could produce approximately 20,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per year.\n\nUnder the agreement, E3 Lithium will continue to operate the Clearwater project and retain its IP, with technical and development support from Imperial in areas such as water and reservoir management. The agreement also includes access for E3 Lithium to freehold lands in the area, which are operated by Imperial.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Imperial has agreed to invest CAD $6.35 million into E3 at a pre-paid price of CAD $1.86\/warrant and the issuance of 3,413,979 warrants. Each warrant provides the holder the option to exercise the warrant for one common share of E3.

(PRNewsfoto\/Lithium South Development Corporation)\n\nThe objective of the program is to potentially expand the current Lithium Carbonate Resource which is defined as 756 parts per million lithium within 571,000 tonnes in the Measured and Indicated Categories with a low magnesium to lithium ration of 2.6 to 1.0.( see news release December 4, 2018 , and NI 43-101 compliant Technical Report titled \"Initial Measured and Indicated Lithium and Potassium Resource Estimate, Hombre Muerto North Project, Salta and Catamarca Provinces, Argentina\", prepared by independent consultants Montgomery and Associates of Santiago, Chile). The resource is contained solely on the Tramo Claim Block, which is 383 hectares in size, and is one of five salar-located, noncontiguous claim blocks that comprise the total project area of 3,287 hectares. The drill program will focus exploration on the Alba Sabrina Claim Block, which is 2,089 hectares in size.\n\nA recent TEM Study at the Alba Sabrina Claim Block (See October 4, 2021, press release) provides potential indication of a surficial halite aquifer of approximately 75 meters of depth, with potential indication of clastic brine aquifer immediately below. \u00a0The TEM Study was limited to a depth of approximately 350 meters, with the basement rock not confirmed. The drill program will attempt to drill to basement, limited to approximately 700 meters by the depth potential of the drill rig.\n\nCompany President, Adrian F. C. Hobkirk quoted, \"We are excited to begin the potential expansion of the high-quality lithium brine resource at the HMN Li Project. \u00a0In particular, to confirm our expectations that deeper drilling will return significant results.\"\n\nAbout Lithium South\n\nThe Hombre Muerto North Lithium Project ( HMN Li Project ) is at an advanced stage of evaluation, with a Preliminary Economic Assessment having been completed in April, 2019. Lithium South is the 100% owner and intends to potentially expand the known resource with its current drill program. Additional project work including permitting, environmental studies and process test work is ongoing\n\nThe HMN Li Project is adjacent to a US$840 million lithium mine under development by the Korean multinational corporation POSCO, which acquired their area from Galaxy Resources Ltd. for US$280 million.\u00a0 \u00a0Livent Corporation \u00a0is producing lithium south of the Hombre Muerto North Lithium Project, and has been in operation there for over twenty five years.\n\nThe Company is evaluating conventional evaporation as a process method, and Direct Lithium Extraction (D.L.E.) as an alternative method.\u00a0 D.L.E. test work on 2,000 liter brine samples is currently underway by Chemphys Chengdu, in China, and Eon Minerals in Salta, Argentina.\n\nThe technical and scientific information in this press release was reviewed by Dr. Mark King, a Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101.

Unless otherwise stated, all figures are quoted in American dollars (\"US$\") and are reported on a 100% equity project basis.\n\nHighlights\n\nAverage production, Year 2 to Year 16 of 173,317 tonnes of chemical grade 5.5% spodumene concentrate Average production, Year 2 to Year 16 of 51,369 tonnes of technical grade 6.0% spodumene concentrate Average production, Year 2 to Year 16 of 441 tonnes of tantalum concentrate Expected life of mine of 17 years Average operating costs of US$74.48 per tonne milled, US$540 per tonne of concentrate (all concentrate production combined) Estimated initial capital cost $US$357 million before working capital 100% equity basis for project Average gross margin of 68.3% After-tax NPV of US$1,915 million (at 8% discount rate), after-tax IRR of 82.4% and average price assumptions of US$4,039 per tonne technical grade lithium concentrate, US$1,852 per tonne chemical grade lithium concentrate, US$130 per kg tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) Anticipated construction time to start of production of 21 months\n\nThe Rose Lithium-Tantalum Project is 100% owned by Critical Elements. The Corporation's market strategy is to enter the lithium market with a low-risk approach. The completion of the feasibility on the spodumene plant is the first step to enter the market and establish the Corporation as a reliable high quality lithium supplier. The low-risk approach is characterized by simple open-pit mining and conventional lithium processing technologies.\n\nCritical Elements has consistently sought to advance the wholly owned Rose Lithium-Tantalum Project in a low-risk manner. To this end, the Corporation has completed a new Feasibility Study with a conservative spodumene concentrate price deck, as well as capital and operating cost estimates reflective of current market conditions. The new Feasibility Study incorporates a standard truck and shovel open-pit mining operation and conventional lithium processing technologies. The Project will produce technical grade spodumene concentrate for the glass and ceramics industry and chemical grade spodumene concentrate for conversion for use in batteries for e-mobility, as well as a tantalite concentrate.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe mine will excavate a total of 26.3M tonnes ore grading an average of 0.87% Li2O and 138 ppm Ta2O5 after dilution. The mill will process 1.61M tonnes of ore per year to produce an annual average of 224,686 tonnes of technical and chemical grade spodumene concentrates and 441 tonnes of tantalite concentrate. The ore is contained in several parallel and continuous shallow dipping pegmatite dykes outcropping on surface. The ore zones are open at depth and a future underground operation is possible.\n\nOver the life of mine, the open pit will excavate a total of 182.4M tonnes of waste rock and 10.9 M tonnes of overburden. The average strip ratio is 7.3 tonnes of waste per tonne of ore.\n\nTable 1 Rose Key FS Results\n\nItem Units Value Production Project life (from start of construction to closure) years 19 Mine life years 17 Total mill feed tonnage M t 26.3 Average mill feed grade Li2O % Li2O 0.87 Ta2O5 ppm Ta2O5 138 Lithium Concentrate Production % of Production, Chemical Grade % 75 % of Production, Technical Grade % 25 Mill recoveries Li2O, Chemical Grade % 90 Li2O, Technical Grade % 87 Ta2O5 % 40 Payable 5.5% Li2O Concentrate, Chemical Grade t 2,798,000 6% Li2O Concentrate, Technical Grade t 829,000 Ta2O5 contained in concentrate kg 1,453,000 Average Commodity Prices 5.5% Li2O Concentrate, Chemical Grade US$\/t conc. 1,852 6% Li2O Concentrate, Technical Grade US$\/t conc. 4,039 Ta2O5 contained in concentrate US$\/kg contained 130\n\nExchange rate 1 US$ : 1.30 CAN$ 0.77 US$ : 1 CAN$ Item Units Value Project Costs CA$ US$ Average Mining Cost $\/t milled 37.89 29.17 Average Milling Cost $\/t milled 19.88 15.31 Average General & Administrative Cost $\/t milled 20.30 15.63 Average Concentrate Transport Costs $\/t milled 18.66 14.37 Project Economics CA$ US$ Gross Revenue $M 10,855 8,358 Total Selling Cost Estimate $M 236 182 Total Operating Cost Estimate $M 2,543 1,958 Total Sustaining Capital Cost Estimate $M 160 123 Total Capital Cost Estimate $M 464 357 Duties and Taxes $M 3,098 2,386 Average Annual EBITDA $M 493 379 Pre-Tax Cash Flow $M 7,452 5,738 After-Tax Cash Flow $M 4,354 3,352 Effective Tax Rate 42% Discount Rate* 8% Pre-Tax Net Present Value @ 8% $M 4,368 3,363 Pre-Tax Internal Rate of Return 125.0% Pre-Tax Payback Period years 1.0 After-Tax Net Present Value @ 8% $M 2,487 1,915 After-Tax Internal Rate of Return 82.4% After-Tax payback period years 1.4\n\n*Discounting starts with commercial production.\n\nProperty\n\nThe Rose property is located in northern Qu\u00e9bec's administrative region, on the territory of Eeyou Istchee James Bay. It is located on Category III land, on the Traditional Lands of the Eastmain Community, approximately 40 kilometers north of the Cree village of Nemaska. The latter is located approximately 300km north-west of Chibougamau.\n\nThe Rose property is accessible by road via the Route du Nord, usable all year round from Chibougamau. The mine site can also be reached by Matagami, via Route 109 and Route du Nord. Figure 1 shows the regional location of the project. The project is located 80 km south of Goldcorp's \u00c9l\u00e9onore gold mine and 45 km north-west of Nemaska's Whabouchi lithium project and 20 km south of Hydro Qu\u00e9bec's Eastmain 1 hydroelectricity generating plant. The Nemiscau airport services the region's air travel needs. The Rose property site is located 50 km by road from the Nemiscau airport.\n\nThe Rose property comprises 473 claims spread over a 24,654-ha area. Geologically, the Rose property is located at the north-east end of the Archean Lake Superior Province of the Canadian Shield.\n\nOver the life of mine, the open pit will excavate a total of 182.4M tonnes of waste rock and 10.9 M tonnes of overburden. The average strip ratio is 7.3 tonnes of waste per tonne of ore.\n\nFigure 1 Rose Property Location Critical Elements Lithium Corporation, Monday, June 13, 2022, Press release picture\n\nReserve Estimate\n\nA Mineral Reserve Estimate for 17 mineralized zones was prepared during this study. The estimation assumed the production of a chemical grade spodumene concentrate with a price of 20 US$ per kg Li2O and a tantalite concentrate with a price of 130 US$ per Kg of Ta2O5. The recoveries were fixed at 85% and 64% for Li and Ta respectively. The grade-recovery curve used for resource estimate, which became available after the mineral reserves were evaluated, was verified and found to have little influence on the reserve estimate. The production of a higher value technical grade spodumene concentrate was not assumed in the reserve estimate.\n\nBased on compilation status, metal price parameters, and metallurgical recovery inputs, the effective date of the estimate is May 27, 2022.\n\nThe estimate was prepared in accordance with CIM's standards and guidelines for reporting mineral resources and reserves.\n\nTable 2 displays the results of the Mineral Reserve Estimate for the Rose Project at the $36.92 NSR per tonne cut-off for the open-pit scenario.\n\nTable 2 Mineral Reserve Estimate\n\nTonnage NSR Li2O_eq Li2O Li2O Ta2O5 Ta2O5 Category (Mt) ($) (%) (%) (000 t) (ppm) (000 t) Probable 26.3 204 0.92 0.87 193.8 138 2.3 Total 26.3 204 0.92 0.87 193.8 138 2.3\n\nThe Independent and Qualified Person for the Mineral Reserve Estimate, as defined by NI 43\u2011101, is Simon Boudreau, P.Eng, of InnovExplo Inc. The effective date of the estimate is May 27, 2022. The model includes 17 mineralized zones. Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes and ppm). The number of metric tons was rounded to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects. Rounding followed the recommendations in NI 43\u2011101. InnovExplo is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issue that could materially affect the Mineral Reserve Estimate.\n\nResource Estimate (\"MRE\")\n\nThe current MRE is primarily based on changes made to the net smelter return (\"NSR\") parameters, supported by new assumptions concerning metal prices and the creation of potentially mineable shape to constrain the MRE for the potential underground extraction scenario. No changes to the interpretation and interpolation parameters were deemed necessary. The mineral resource model for the current MRE is based largely upon the model generated for the 2011 PEA.\n\nThe effective date of the estimate is May 27th, 2022, based on compilation status, metal price parameters, metallurgical recovery inputs and creation of the constraining volume.\n\nGiven the density of the processed data, the search ellipse criteria, the drill hole density and the specific interpolation parameters, the QP is of the opinion that the current MRE can be classified as Indicated and Inferred resources. The estimate was prepared in accordance with CIM's standards and guidelines for reporting mineral resources and reserves.\n\nTable 3 displays the results of the MRE for the Rose Project using $31.4 NSR\/t cut-off for the open-pit potential extraction scenario and and $121.12 NSR cut-off for the underground potential extraction scenario.\n\nTable 3 Mineral Resource Estimate Critical Elements Lithium Corporation, Monday, June 13, 2022, Press release picture\n\nThe Independent and Qualified Person for the Mineral Resource Estimate, as defined by NI 43\u2011101, is Carl Pelletier, P.Geo., of InnovExplo Inc. The effective date of the estimate is May 27, 2022. The MRE follow 2014 CIM Definition Standards and the 2019 CIM MRMR Best Practice Guidelines. These Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves as they do not have demonstrated economic viability. The model includes 23 mineralized zones. The reasonable prospect for eventual economic extraction is met by having constraining volumes applied to any blocks (potential open -pit or underground extraction scenario) using Whittle and the Deswik Stope Optimizer (DSO) and by the application of cut-off grades. The mineral resource is reported at a cut-off of $31.4 NSR for the open-pit potential; and of $121.12 NSR for the underground potential based on market conditions (metal price, exchange rate and production cost). A range of densities was used on a per-zone basis based on statistical analysis of all available data. A minimum true thickness of 2.0 metres was applied, using the grade of the adjacent material when assayed or a value of zero when not assayed. High grade capping was done on raw assay data based on the statistical analyses of individual mineralized zones. Compositing was done on drill hole intercepts falling within mineralized zones (composite lengths vary from 1.5 m to 3 m in order to distribute the tails adequately). Resources were evaluated from drill holes using a 2-pass OK interpolation method in a block model (block size = 5 m x 5 m x 5 m). The inferred category is only defined within the areas where blocks were interpolated during pass 1 or pass 2 where continuity is sufficient to avoid isolated blocks being interpolated by only one drill hole. The indicated category is only defined by blocks interpolated by a minimum of two drill holes in areas where the maximum distance to the closest drill hole composite is less than 40 metres for blocks interpolated in pass 1. Results are presented in-situ. The number of metric tons was rounded to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects. Rounding followed the recommendations in NI 43\u2011101. The qualified persons are not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political or marketing issues, or any other relevant issue, that could materially affect the potential development of mineral resources other than those discussed in the MRE.\n\nFeasibility Study\n\nThe parameters used for the feasibility study are the following:\n\nOpen pit mining rate of 1,610,000 tpy Spodumene process plant with a 4,600 tpd capacity\n\nMining Operation\n\nThe mineralization is hosted within outcropping pegmatite dykes subparallel to surface. The ore body is relatively flat, close to surface and comprised of north oriented stacked lenses. Mineralization recognized to date on the Rose property includes rare element of Lithium-Cesium-Tantalum or LCT-type pegmatites and molybdenum occurrences.\n\nA conventional truck and shovel open-pit approach was considered to mine the Rose Lithium-Tantalum Project's Probable Mineral Reserves. The dimensions of the engineered pit design are approximately 1,620m long x 900m wide x 220m deep.\n\nThe life of mine plan (LOM) proposes to mine 26.3 Mt of ore, 182.4 Mt of waste, and 10.9 Mt of overburden for a total of 219.6 Mt of material. The average stripping ratio is 7.3 tonnes of waste per tonne of ore. The nominal production rate is estimated at 4,600 tonnes per day and 350 operating days per year.\n\nThe mining operation production rate is set to approximately 15 Mt of material per year. An open pit mining schedule was planned and resulted in a mine life of 17 years.\n\nContract mining will be used for the removal of the overburden while Critical Elements will undertake the mining of all hard rock material with its own equipment fleet and operators.\n\nThe main production fleet will consist of one (1) backhoe excavator, one (1) electric front shovel, one (1) wheel loader, seven (7) haul trucks (65t), seven (7) haul trucks (135t), two (2) rotary drills, one (1) DTH drill, two (2) bulldozers, one (1) wheel dozer, two (2) graders, one (1) auxiliary excavator, one (1) auxiliary wheel loader, and two (2) water trucks.\n\nThe Rose project pit was designed with a 10m single benching arrangement. A 57\u00b0 inter-ramp angle and an overall pit slope angle of 55\u00b0 were utilized for the ultimate pit design. A berm width of 7.0m corresponding to the recommended overall slope angle was used. The pit slopes in overburden have a face ratio of 2.5:1 with a 10m berm width.\n\nThe main in-pit haulage ramp is designed at 30.9m wide to allow a double-lane traffic, except for the last benches at the pit bottom that are designed at 20.4m wide for single lane traffic. A 2m drainage ditch is included to allow for water drainage and pipe installation. The maximum gradient of the inner curvature of all ramp segments is 10%.\n\nFigure 2 Rose Pit Plan View Critical Elements Lithium Corporation, Monday, June 13, 2022, Press release picture\n\nFigure 3 Rose Pit Side View Looking West Critical Elements Lithium Corporation, Monday, June 13, 2022, Press release picture\n\nMineral Processing\n\nA standard froth flotation process will be utilized to produce technical grade and chemical grade lithium concentrates and a tantalum concentrate. The mineral process plant will consist of crushing, beneficiation, and dewatering areas. The technical grade lithium concentrate will grade 6.0% Li2O while the chemical grade lithium concentrate will grade 5.5% Li2O. The tantalum concentrate will grade 20% Ta2O5.\n\nThe beneficiation process includes crushing, grinding, magnetic separation and flotation. The crushing circuit will consist of a jaw crusher and two (secondary and tertiary) cone crushers, and screens. The crushed ore will have a P80 of 13 mm and will be stockpiled in a 9,200-tonne capacity dome; this is sufficient for approximately two days of mill operation. The grinding circuit will consist of a ball mill operating in a closed circuit and a two-stage cyclone cluster. The tantalum will first be recovered at a grade of 2.0% Ta2O5 by high intensity magnetic separation then upgraded further to 20.0% Ta2O5 by gravity separation. The lithium flotation circuit will include removal of slimes after magnetic separation followed by mica flotation, scrubbing, and spodumene flotation to the required grade. The lithium flotation circuit will remove slimes, separate mica, and purify the lithium to the required grade. The spodumene concentrate will then be thickened, vacuum filtered, dried to 1% moisture, and stored in 1500-tonne silo from where it can be bulk loaded into trucks. The tailings will be thickened, vacuum filtered to 15% moisture or less, and trucked to the waste rock \/ tailings piles where it will be dry stacked.\n\nThe spodumene plant will operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, and 52 weeks per year. The process plant was designed with an operating availability of 90%. The crushing circuit was designed using an operating availability of 50%. The concentrator capacity has been established at a nominal throughput rate of 4 900 dry tonnes per day. The plant has a capacity of 1,610,000 per year.\n\nThe process plant flowsheet developed by Bumigeme Inc. is presented in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4 Rose Process Flowsheet Critical Elements Lithium Corporation, Monday, June 13, 2022, Press release picture\n\nMetallurgy\n\nBench scale metallurgical testing was performed at ACME Metallurgical Limited in Vancouver in 2011. The results from these tests were used for the PEA study. Three composites; the Rose (main structure), the Rose Sud-Est (Southeast structure) and Tantalum (secondary structure with higher tantalum and lower lithium content) were subjected to various metallurgical tests.\n\nSGS Canada Inc. in Lakefield conducted tests from 2013 to 2015 to improve lithium and tantalum recoveries. In 2015 SGS Canada Inc. developed a conceptual flowsheet based on a series of bench scale tests on various samples from the Rose deposit. The proposed flowsheet consists of conventional three-stage crushing and single stage grinding followed by magnetic separation for the recovery of tantalum, mica flotation, and spodumene flotation. This flowsheet was the basis of the process plant design.\n\nSGS Canada also conducted a pilot plant program in early 2017 on two samples from the Rose project (Rose and Rose South). The main objective of the pilot plant program was to generate spodumene concentrate for testing in a lithium carbonate pilot plant which was conducted by Outotec in Germany and Finland. Secondary objectives were to prove metallurgical performance on a continuous pilot scale and to generate metallurgical and operating data for further studies. The spodumene pilot plant demonstrated the robustness of the design process.\n\nThe Feasibility Study assumes 87.3% and 90% recovery for technical and chemical grade lithium concentrates respectively and 40% minimum recovery for the tantalum concentrate.\n\nProcess water will be recycled releasing minimal amounts to the equalization pond and final effluent treatment plant.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Impact Assessment\n\nThe final environmental impact assessment (EIA) was submitted to the governments of Canada and Quebec in February 2019. CELC has answered a series of questions from both government bodies (COMEX and CEAA). In August 2021, Critical Elements announced that the Federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change had rendered a favorable decision in respect of the proposed Rose Project. In a Decision Statement, which included the conditions to be complied with by the Corporation, the Minister confirmed that the Project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects when mitigation measures are taken into account.\n\nThe final remaining step in the Rose Project's approval process is the completion of the provincial permitting process, which runs parallel to the federal process. Pursuant to the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement (JBNQA), the provincial environmental assessment is conducted jointly by the Cree Nation Government and the Government of Quebec under the Environmental and Social Impact Review Committee (\"COMEX\"). The provincial assessment is already well advanced and has undergone several rounds of questions from COMEX and answered by Critical Elements in the normal course of the assessment process. At this time, Critical Elements has received no further questions from COMEX and remains confident in a positive outcome given the stated support for lithium project development in the Province of Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nCritical Elements has been working since the beginning with the Eastmain Community, on whose lands the Project lies. The Corporation has also maintained good relations with the Grand Council of the Cree and with the neighbouring Nation of Nemaska. Consultations have been ongoing and are planned throughout the life of the Project. In 2019, Critical Elements entered into an impact and benefits agreement with the Cree Nation of Eastmain, the Grand Council of the Cree (Eeyou Istchee), and the Cree Nation Government called the Pihkuutaau Agreement.\n\nThe Corporation's mine closure and restoration plan was accepted by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of the Province of Qu\u00e9bec (MERN) in April 2022.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThe Project infrastructure includes site main access, services and haulage roads, explosive and detonator storage, a spodumene processing plant, a maintenance facility, a warehouse, diesel and gasoline storage, LNG storage and distribution, ore stockpile pad, waste rock and dry tailings stockpile, overburden stockpile, main electrical substation and distribution, fresh and potable water supply, sewage, surface water management, final effluent treatment, communication system, gate house, and an administrative building.\n\nThe mine site layout is shown in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5 Rose Site Layout Critical Elements Lithium Corporation, Monday, June 13, 2022, Press release picture\n\nWaste rock and tailings samples were analyzed at the SGS Canada's laboratory in Lakefield and both were found to be non-acid generating. The dry tailings and the waste rock will be stored in the same facility which has sufficient capacity for the life of mine. Rain and snow melt water will be collected in ditches and pumped to the water treatment plant.\n\nThe industrial pad has an area of 296,000 m2 and will contain the process plant, the maintenance facility, warehouse, administration building, diesel and gasoline storage tanks, LNG storage and distribution, and all associated services. LNG will be used for buildings heating and for the drying of the lithium and tantalum concentrates. The ore pad will have a 3.9M tonne capacity where low-grade material may be stored.\n\nThe hydrology study has suggested that water inflow to the open pit is to be expected. In order to maximize pit slopes, water wells will be constructed around the pit periphery to lower the water table below the pit floor. One of these wells will be used to supply the mine site with fresh water. Water from the other wells will be directed to sedimentation ponds and treated, if necessary, before being released to the final effluent.\n\nWater from the waste rock \/ dry tailings stockpile, the open pit, the industrial pad, the overburden stockpile and the roads will be collected in an equalization pond and treated before being released as final effluent.\n\nThe mine site will have a 2.7 km main access road from the Eastmain 1 road to the industrial pad. Including the service roads, the site will total 15.8 km of roads.\n\nElectricity will be provided by Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. A 315 kV electrical transport line (L3176), owned by Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec, runs North-South over the eastern side of the Rose Property. It runs over the planned open pit. The portion running over the open pit representing 4.2 km will be rerouted to allow open pit operation.\n\nFigure 6 Power Line at Rose Site Critical Elements Lithium Corporation, Monday, June 13, 2022, Press release picture\n\nCapital Costs\n\nThe capital and operating costs were estimated in Canadian dollars.

With the declining cost of Li-cells, targets for 1 kWh being now very close to 150 US$, they are also becoming attractive for use in private installations combined with increasing use of photovoltaic roof-top electricity generation (PV). For example, in Germany a new regulation demands that for all PV projects exceeding 1MW power generation an energy storage system has to be installed by 2025. This is intended to avoid peak energy stressing the electricity distribution systems, a phenomenon which already pushes European systems to their limits during the summer months and increasingly so with the ongoing addition of new PV systems, be they commercial or private.\n\nIn the coming years the major driver of the Lithium demand growth continues to be the electro mobility. The IHS Markit Global Production Forecasts from December 2021 assumes an electric vehicle penetration rate of 22% in 2025 and 39% in 2030. This mainly in combination with the expected growth of average battery size will result in a strong increase of the Lithium demand.\n\nConsidering about 100 million new cars per year by 2030, and assuming that 40% of them are BEVs equipped with an average 55-kWh battery, this market segment alone will require in excess of 1.5 million metric tons of LCE. In addition, this does not include other transport segments such as two\/three-wheelers, light duty trucks, heavy duty trucks, electric stationary storage (ESS), etc.\n\nMost recently, all major lithium producers as well as the leading market analysts have increased their forecasts significantly. Figure 10 shows the actual demand forecast as well as previous projections from Albemarle.\n\nFigure 10 Lithium Demand Forecast for 2025 and 2030 Critical Elements Lithium Corporation, Monday, June 13, 2022, Press release picture\n\nLithium Price Outlook\n\nBased on the actual demand forecast, the increased production cost of incumbents and newcomers, the rising quality requirements and more stringent ESG requirements leading to higher capital expenditures, a price higher than 1,500 US$\/MT for 6% spodumene concentrate resulting in an approximate price of 22,000 US$\/MT of LCE is a prerequisite for putting new projects into production. As the market faces a structural supply deficit for the remainder of this decade, prices are expected to exceed minimum price requirements. Benchmark Minerals and Fastmarkets both reported in Q2 2022 contractual prices exceeding 60 US$\/kg for lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide as well as 5,500 to 6,000 US$\/mt for spodumene 6%. Also, suppliers who are able to provide a higher quality chemical grade spodumene yielding lower conversion cost will also be able to achieve higher prices.\n\nThe market for technical grade spodumene is a specialty chemicals market, which addresses the specific needs for customers in the glass and ceramics industry. Historically, prices have been reflecting the higher value of iron free spodumene like in lithium carbonate and specific properties of the crystalline material.\n\nTherefore, pricing for technical grade spodumene is directly linked to the lithium oxide content in lithium carbonate.\n\nOngoing Work\n\nThe geotechnical program is being completed.\n\nFront-End Engineering is being conducted and detailed engineering work will follow.\n\nThe detailed design of the co-disposal facility for the stacked tailings and pit waste rock is under way.\n\nReport Filing\n\nThe Corporation plans to file an NI 43-101 technical report that summarizes the Rose Lithium-Tantalum project on SEDAR (http:\/\/www.sedar.com) and on the Corporation's website (http:\/\/www.cecorp.ca\/en\/) within 45 days.\n\nQualified Persons\n\nThe Feasibility Study was prepared in accordance to 43-101 standards by WSP Canada Inc (WSP), Bumigeme inc, and InnovExplo Inc.. InnovExplo Inc was responsible for the resource estimate and the mine plan, Bumigeme Inc was responsible for the mineral processing, WSP was responsible for environmental study, project infrastructure, financial modelling, and report integration.

A final decision is expected at the end of 2022 or beginning of 2023.\n\nThe United States and Europe have accelerated efforts over the past two years to build secure and independent supply chains to cut reliance on China for key minerals used in electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels.\n\nStory continues\n\nTozier said the classification would \"hinder the localisation of the EU battery supply chain, and instead move the process to a non-EU location, thereby creating the need to import\".\n\n\"Future battery recycling and cathode manufacturing would move outside of the EU. Albemarle would not be able to convert materials locally, and any EU lithium raw materials would need to be exported to create cathodes.\"\n\nHaving produced lithium since 1921, the Langelsheim plant employs more than 600 people and accounts for 8% of New-York listed Albemarle's projected 2022 net sales.\n\nThe European Commission has estimated Europe would need up to 18 times more lithium by 2030 than in 2020, and 60 times more by 2050.\n\n\"Classifying lithium as hazardous would create extra burdens on how lithium chemicals for batteries are produced, used and recycled in Europe,\" an industry source said.\n\n(Reporting by Clara Denina and Pratima Desai; Additional reporting by Kate Abnett in Brussels; Editing by Jan Harvey)","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/top-producer-albemarle-risks-shutting-151046031.html","symbols":["ALB.US","AMC.F"],"tags":["ALBEMARLE CORP","ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERIES","EUROPEAN CHEMICALS AGENCY","EUROPEAN COMMISSION","EUROPEAN UNION","LANGELSHEIM","LITHIUM CARBONATE","LITHIUM CHLORIDE","SCOTT TOZIER"],"sentiment":{"polarity":-0.396,"neg":0.051,"neu":0.899,"pos":0.05}},{"date":"2022-06-05T23:17:00+00:00","title":"Continued strong product pricing and operational update","content":"Allkem Limited\n\nBRISBANE, Australia, June 06, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Allkem Limited (ASX|TSX: \u201cAKE\u201d, the \u201cCompany\u201d) provides an update on product pricing and operations.\n\nLithium carbonate\n\nContinued strong market conditions positively impacted the price received for lithium carbonate from the Olaroz Lithium Facility. The June quarter FY22 average price received for lithium carbonate is expected to be approximately 14% above prior guidance at US$40,000\/t FOB1 on sales of approximately 3,500 tonnes. Customers continue to value security of supply which is reflected in a fully committed order book for the remainder of the calendar year.\n\nSpodumene\n\nSimilarly strong conditions continue in the spodumene market with realised spodumene concentrate pricing in the June quarter of approximately US$5,000\/t SC6% CIF. Shipped spodumene concentrate for the quarter is anticipated to be approximately 38,000 dry metric tonnes (\u201cdmt\") at an average grade in line with customer requirements of 5.3% with a further 15,000 dmt to be shipped in early July 2022.\n\nCurrent estimated annual spodumene production for FY22 is anticipated to fall marginally short of guidance by approximately 2-4%, at between 192,000 - 196,000 dmt, due to production delays resulting from the highly competitive Western Australian resources labour market and COVID-19 related requirements due to the delayed re-opening of the Western Australian border. Strategies have been implemented to mitigate these temporary impacts on production.\n\nArgentine reference price\n\nArgentina\u2019s Customs Agency has recently set a reference price for lithium carbonate of US$53,000\/t. This reference price is used by regulatory authorities when reviewing export sales of lithium chemicals to prevent under-invoicing and improve pricing transparency. This price is not used for calculation of taxes, royalties or duties and Allkem does not expect it will have any material impact on product exports, realised prices or profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis release was authorised by Mr Martin Perez de Solay, CEO and Managing Director of Allkem Limited.\n\nAllkem Limited\r\n\r\nABN 31 112 589 910 \r\n\r\nLevel 35, 71 Eagle St\r\nBrisbane, QLD 4000 Investor Relations & Media Enquiries\r\n\r\nAndrew Barber \r\nM: +61 418 783 701 E: Andrew.Barber@allkem.co\r\n\r\nPhoebe Lee\r\nP: +61 7 3064 3600 E:Phoebe.Lee@allkem.co Connect\r\n\r\ninfo@allkem.co\r\n+61 7 3064 3600\r\nwww.allkem.co\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICES\n\nThis investor ASX\/TSX release (Release) contains general information about the Company as at the date of this Release.

Trafigura already moves about a fifth of the world\u2019s tradeable battery-grade nickel and 10% of all cobalt, yet the company \u2014 along with the very biggest players in the metals and mining world \u2014 has so far largely stayed on the sidelines when it comes to lithium.\n\nDemand for lithium in batteries has risen so sharply that some car companies have gone directly to miners to secure metals needed to deliver cars to consumers. Tesla Inc.\u2019s Elon Musk and Nissan Motor Co. executive Ashwani Gupta have both recently talked about owning or investing in mines in the future.\n\nAs part of the plan with Green Lithium, Trafigura will also supply feedstock to the UK plant, which will sell battery-grade lithium chemicals to EV makers in Europe.

Recent estimates from McKinsey suggest a global demand of around 3 million metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2030. In contrast, the total global LCE output for 2021 amounted to only 540,000 metric tons, a mere 18% of the anticipated need for 2030. These figures point to a potential shortfall in the future and questions are being raised over how this demand will be met.\n\nThe rise in this demand is attributed to an increase in consumer demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs). These EVs are requiring batteries that have higher energy densities and longer lifespans, the main component of which is high-grade lithium. The sudden rise in demand has caused raw lithium prices to skyrocket, leaving battery producers scrambling to secure their supply of a commodity that is quickly entering into a shortage. So this begs the question: Which companies are best positioned to take advantage? Mined production volume, modelled for 93% available capacity. Source: Minespans, McKinsey lithium demand model\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)\n\nAlbemarle is a global leader in the extraction and production of lithium, bromine and refining catalyst solutions. Lithium is undoubtedly the largest branch of the business, accounting for 42% of the US$3.3B in net sales for the 2021 calendar year. \r\nAt a current output of 88,000 metric tons of LCE per year, Albemarle asserts itself as a dominant player in the lithium market at 16% total market share. The company is poised to continue in a strong market popsition with plans expand processing infrastructure in 2022 and with the long-term goal of more than doubling their lithium production capacity. With this expansion pipeline, they'll be targeting low-cost juristictions to reduce capital expenditure and impove returns.\n\nHere are where we see Albemarle\u2019s competitive advantage lay:\n\nProject feasibility. Albemarle has proved it can already economically produce battery grade lithium in a period where lithium prices were much lower, illustrating the company\u2019s ability to continue operations should lithium prices fall. Ability to be self-funded. Albemarle's lithium branch is already profit making, so earnings can be retained and capital can be invested into the aforementioned expansion projects without the need for significant capital raises or taking on large amounts of debt. Smaller companies and emerging players will have to undergo financing stages which carry risks and may result in shareholder dilution.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlbemarle has a firm grasp on the market and seems positioned to continue riding this lithium wave from strength to strength. But these factors don\u2019t paint the full picture and investors should always consider the financials of a company to inform their assessment.

Producing 101,000 metric tons of LCE during 2021, SQM\u2019s impressive output accounts for 18.7% of global lithium production for the year and with several project expansions in the works, this output will continue to scale with the market demand.\n\nAccording to SQM\u2019s latest earnings report, 2022 sales estimates top out at 140,000 metric tons of lithium, with capacity potentially reaching 190,000-200,000 should expansion projects be completed in time, and dependant on the market demand for lithium.\n\nHere are the key factors driving the company forward in the next few years:\n\nSignificant Expansion pipeline. With SQM\u2019s joint venture in Mt Holland expecting to enter production in 2024 and a drastic increase to the production capabilities of their Salar del Carmen project, there\u2019s ample opportunity for the company to grow their presence in the market and beat out new entrants. Variable exposure to lithium prices. Looking forward to 2022, SQM\u2019s sales contracts are detailed as follows: 20% fixed or variable price, 50% variable price with a ceiling and 30% not contracted. This means that SQM will still be exposed to the increase in lithium prices on previously negotiated contracts even if the price of lithium was lower at the time the contract was agreed upon, opening the company up to increased revenues.\n\nInvestors should always consider the risks and financial health of a company to inform their investment decision. You can see our rundown of SQM\u2019s risks and financials for free on our website .\n\nLivent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM)\n\nLivent\u2019s premier resource is located in Salar Del Hombre Muerto in Argentina, achieving a reasonable current output of 27,000 metric tons of Lithium Carbonate and Lithium Chloride. While this is modest in comparison to the big players in the sector, expansion is at the forefront of the company\u2019s mission, with a 20,0000 metric tons expansion of their Argentinian operation slated for 2023 and a further 20,000 metric tons anticipated for 2025.\n\nLivent\u2019s production figures account for around 5% of the total market share. While this lags the other two companies, Livent\u2019s key focus on cost leadership within the production of LCE, Lithium Hydroxide and Lithium Chloride should provide an advantage over its peers.\n\nThese are the factors that are important to the performance of Livent:\n\nLow cost focus. High lithium prices can make many more projects economically feasible, but striving for lower operating costs will mean a project can weather the storm if demand and prices fall. By securing a low-impurity lithium resource, Livent has allowed processing costs to be cut, giving a competitive advantage over other brine operations. Exposure to Lithium Carbonate, Lithium Chloride and Lithium Hydroxide prices. New high-density batteries are more compatible with lithium hydroxide owing to greater nickel content in the cathodes. Should primary lithium demand switch from carbonate to hydroxide, Livent\u2019s exposure to the prices in both products should help it navigate pricing volatility.\n\nLivent is a smaller company and that does carry some possible risks. Investors who are interested in finding out more can do so for free on our website .\n\nThe Future Prospects\n\nWhen you take a step back and look at the global lithium sector, you begin to see a trend. Most supply comes from a select few companies, leaving a mass of newcomers are scrambling to secure funding to bring their projects to market. After all, there\u2019s no shortage of lithium resources on Earth, just a shortage of processing power to extract it from the ground and refine it. New companies coming to the table will reach maturity and begin reaping the rewards of their capital investments. These next few companies aren\u2019t generating significant revenues but we believe they\u2019ll be ones to watch.\n\nLithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC)\n\nLithium Americas is an emerging player in the sector. Their flagship project is their Cauchari-Olaroz brine resource in Argentina, which is currently 85% through the construction of its Stage 1 production facility, targeting 40,000 metric tons per annum (tpa) of battery-grade lithium carbonate. Lithium Americas is striving for cost leadership, forecasting operating expenditure of US$3,600 per metric tonne. With a project life of 40 years and a second stage expansion already on the cards, there is plenty to keep investors following their developments closely.\n\nHere are some of the Lithium Americas\u2019 most eye-catching features:\n\nCompleted acquisition of Millennial Lithium in January 2022. Lithium Americas now has 100% ownership of the advanced-stage Pastos Grandes project, which is located nearby to their Cauchar\u00ed-Olaroz tenements. The transaction was completed for around US$400 million and provides Lithium Americas with exposure to a rich brine resource of 4.1 million metric tonnes of LCE. Continued development of Thacker Pass resource. Lithium Americas has a 100% stake in one of the largest resources in the United States. The project\u2019s feasibility study is due in the second half of 2022, targeting 40,000 tpa of lithium carbonate, with scenarios being assessed for expansion up to a total of 80,0000 tpa.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) to supply spodumene concentrate from their North Carolina project. The agreement is for an initial five-year term on a fixed price commitment representing one-third of Piedmont\u2019s planned production from their North Carolina project. Deliveries planned to begin between July 2022 and July 2023, but timeline has been postponed indefinitely due to delays in development. The Carolina project offers industry leading sustainability with close proximity to a key target market. Piedmont owns 100% of the project which is set to lead the way in terms of cost and sustainability, offering much lower direct water usage in the processing of lithium hydroxide, requiring only 6,300 gallons per tonne of LiOH. Compare this to Chilean projects in the Atacama region which need up to 124,000 gallons of water per tonne, it\u2019s clear to see where the benefits lay for Piedmont as water scarcity continues to be a frequent discussion point into the future.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to find out about the growth estimates for Piedmont Lithium Inc.

As regards volume, it stuck by its previous guidance of an increase in output of between 20% and 30%, as it ramps up production at its Wodgina mine in Australia. It then expects lithium output to double between 2023 and 2025 to around 200,000 tons, with a slight preponderance of lithium hydroxide over lithium carbonate.\n\nThe company now sees full-year earnings per share at between $9.25 and $12.25, up from a prior estimate of $5.65 to $6.65. Net cash from operations is now seen as high as $800 million this year. That cash flow is on course to cut the company's net debt to less than two times EBITDA from a multiple of 2.3 times at the end of 2021. It will also fund an increase of over 40% in capital expenditure to around $1.4 billion.\n\nNet sales, meanwhile, are now expected between $5.2 billion and $5.6 billion, well above a prior consensus of around $4.4 billion.\n\nAlbemarle stock stood out on a morning when the broader market was again in a retreat after a sharp rally in response to the Federal Reserve's press conference on Wednesday.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAlbermarle Stock Soars After Bullish Update on Lithium Outlook\n\nItaly's Leonardo says well-placed for surge in military spending\n\nNasdaq slumps 4% as bets of big rate hikes grow despite Fed view","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/albermarle-stock-soars-bullish-lithium-104121417.html","symbols":["ALB.US","AMC.F"],"tags":["ALBEMARLE STOCK","CONSENSUS FORECASTS","LITHIUM CARBONATE","LITHIUM HYDROXIDE"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.875,"neg":0.025,"neu":0.917,"pos":0.058}},{"date":"2022-05-04T23:00:00+00:00","title":"3 Impressive Lithium Stocks Flying Under Wall Street\u2019s Radar","content":"Over the past few months, oil and commodity markets have been taking out fresh highs after the shuttering of Ukrainian ports, sanctions against Russia, and disruption in Libyan oil production sent energy, crop, and metal buyers scrambling for replacement supplies. Russia is one of the world's biggest exporters of key raw materials, from crude oil and gas to wheat and aluminum, and the possible exclusion of supplies from the country due to sanctions has sent traders and importers into a frenzy.\n\nBase metals prices have been coming off recent highs (and in the case of aluminum, copper and tin, all-time highs) set earlier in the month that were spurred by fears over the potential for disruption to Russia\u2019s metal exports following its invasion of Ukraine. Broad-based supply concerns remain, ranging from the potential for sanctions targeting exports, to actual output disruption and logistical dislocations (see \u2018Implications of the Russia-Ukraine crisis for metals\u2019 for details).\n\nBut the Ukraine crisis is only layering onto another more powerful trend: the global transition to low-carbon energy.\n\nThe energy transition is driving the next commodity supercycle, with immense prospects for technology manufacturers, energy traders, and investors. Clean energy technologies require more metals than their fossil fuel-based counterparts, with prices of green metals projected to reach historical peaks for an unprecedented, sustained period in a net-zero emissions scenario.\n\nBut few, if any, green metals have witnessed a price explosion as epic as that of lithium.\n\nAfter more than quadrupling in value last year, lithium carbonate continues to soar in 2022 according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.\n\nThe rally in lithium hydroxide, used in high-nickel content cathode manufacture, is accelerating, up 120% so far this year, narrowing the discount to lithium carbonate, which historically is priced below hydroxide.\n\nBenchmark says that Chinese inventory levels for hydroxide, carbonate, and spodumene feedstock remain very low, sustaining the high price environment. Many investors who got burned by the last lithium price bust of 2018 have probably been watching on the sidelines, not sure what to make of the current mega-rally.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated: Norway Plans Record Gas Volumes For Europe\n\nTo be fair, China's spot market, where small tonnages can have big price impacts, may be accentuating the scale of this mega-rally, but make no mistake about it: this is no false flag, with everything from mined spodumene to high-purity hydroxide, and every component of the lithium processing chain experiencing a wild price surge. The price explosion tells you that lithium supply is simply nowhere near enough to feed this demand surge.\n\nWith earnings season here with us again,\u00a0 the famous lithium trio of Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM), FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) and Albermale (NYSE:ALB) will be heavily scrutinized. However, only SQM has really impressed with a 51.4% return so far this year, with FMC and ALB returning 9.9% and -12.7%, respectively, over the timeframe. The three companies are some of the largest in the business, with SQM boasting a $21.1B market cap, FMC is worth $16.7B while ALB is valued at $22.6B.\n\nLuckily, scores of lithium juniors have been responding more readily to the lithium price boom. Here are some that have been outstanding so far this year.\n\n#1. Lithium Energy Exploration Inc.\n\nMarket Cap: $14.7M\n\nYTD Returns: 328.6%\n\nHeadquartered in Toronto, Canada, Lithium Energi Exploration Inc. (OTCPK:LXENF)(TSXV:LEXI) engages in the acquisition, exploration, and development of lithium brine assets in Argentina. The company holds interests in the Laguna Caro project that includes eight mineral concessions covering approximately 17,759 hectares; the Antofalla North project that consists of thirteen mineral concessions covering approximately 41,496 hectares; and the Antofalla South project that includes eighteen mineral concessions covering 69,112 hectares in Argentina.\n\nIncorporated in 1998, Lithium Energi was formerly known as Portola Resources Inc. and changed its name to Lithium Energi Exploration Inc. in March 2017.\n\nBack in January, Lithium Energi Exploration announced that, under its JV Agreement with Global Oil Management Group, LLC (\"GOMG\"), implementation of exploration and development plans have been accelerating rapidly.\n\nLEXI reported that it\u2019s a\u00a0 20% non-dilutable stakeholder in the JV and that development is slated to commence immediately, with the Sorcia Group owning the exclusive license to utilize the International Battery Metals Ltd\u2019s (OTCPK:BATF) technology in Argentina and Chile. IBAT further stated that it has substantially completed the construction of its first lithium extraction unit and the system modules are currently being heat traced and insulated with final assembly and testing to take place in March in the U.S. prior to deployment to South America.\n\nRelated: Oil Prices Hit $110 As Europe Prepares To Ban Russian Crude\n\n#2. Sayona Mining Limited\n\nMarket Cap: $1.6B\n\nYTD Returns: 111.1%\n\nPaddington, Australia-based Sayona Mining Limited (OTCQB:SYAXF), together with its subsidiaries, engages in mineral exploration and development in Australia and Canada. The company explores for lithium, graphite, and gold deposits. Its flagship project is the Authier Lithium Project located in Quebec, Canada. The company also holds a 60% interest in the Moblan lithium project located in Northern Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nLast year, Sayona Mining reported that the Superior Court of Quebec approved its joint bid with Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) for the acquisition of North American Lithium, which owns a previously producing lithium project near Sayona's core Authier project.\n\nMore than $400M had been spent on the project, which was operational and ramping toward nameplate production in 2018 but then was placed on care and maintenance due to weak lithium markets and a shaky capital structure.\n\nSayona and Piedmont say they are proceeding with technical studies that would prepare for the integration of Sayona's Authier and Tansim projects with the facilities at NAL.\n\n#3. Frontier Lithium Inc.\n\nMarket Cap: $578.6M\n\nYTD Returns: 76.1%\n\nVal Caron, Canada-based Frontier Lithium Inc. (OTCQX:LITOF) engages in the acquisition, exploration, and development of mining properties in Canada. The company primarily holds a 100% interest in the PAK Lithium project, which covers 1,378 contiguous mining claim units totaling 26,774 hectares located in northwestern Ontario, Canada.\n\nFrontier has forged a strategic partnership agreement with XPS Expert Process Solutions to develop a process to refine spodumene concentrate into lithium hydroxide. Further, Frontier Lithium owns 100% of the PAK Lithium Project, located in northwestern Ontario. This is a very high-grade spodumene resource with low iron and low impurities. The PEA post-tax NPV8% is estimated at US$974.6m based on producing 23,174tpa LiOH.\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nThe U.S. Shale Patch Is Facing A Plethora Of Problems  Europe May Lose The Energy Transition Race Before It Really Begins  Upstream Oil Industry To See Highest Profits Ever In 2022\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/3-impressive-lithium-stocks-flying-230000351.html","symbols":["ALB.US","AMC.F","CL.COMM","FMC.US","FMQ.F","GC.COMM","HG.COMM","KW.COMM","PLL.US","QYM.F","SQM.US","SYA.AU","ZG.COMM"],"tags":["CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES","FMC CORPORATION","LITHIUM CARBONATE","LITHIUM HYDROXIDE","SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.995,"neg":0.05,"neu":0.847,"pos":0.103}},{"date":"2022-05-04T14:31:40+00:00","title":"Livent Soars as Lithium Demand Boosts Revenue","content":"By Sam Boughedda\n\nInvesting.com -- Livent Corp (NYSE:LTHM) shares surged 23.3% after it reported its first-quarter earnings after the close Tuesday, with better-than-expected revenue driven by increased demand for lithium.\n\nThe company reported that revenue rose 56% to $143.5 million compared to the prior year and beat analysts' estimates of $139.81 million.

Reported GAAP net income was $53.2 million, 609% higher than the previous quarter, and 28 cents per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA was $53.3 million, 94% higher than the previous quarter, and adjusted earnings per share were 21 cents per diluted share. Further improvement in lithium market conditions and strong customer demand in the first quarter supported higher realized prices than anticipated at the beginning of the year.\n\n\"Strong lithium demand growth has continued in 2022,\" said Paul Graves, president and chief executive officer of Livent. \"Published lithium prices in all forms have increased rapidly amid very tight market conditions and Livent continues to achieve higher realized prices across its entire product portfolio.\"\n\nCapacity Expansion Update\n\nLivent remains on schedule to deliver all previously announced capacity expansions. The Company has also announced significant additional capacity expansions for both lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, as Livent continues to grow its production to meet future demand from its customers.\n\nLithium Carbonate\n\nIn its first expansion in Argentina, Livent is on track to add 10,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate capacity by the first quarter of 2023. Another 10,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate capacity is expected to be added in Argentina by the end of 2023, which will nearly double Livent's total available LCEs (1) from 2021 levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Company also announced last quarter that it began engineering work on a second capacity expansion in Argentina. Following completion of a preliminary analysis, this expansion is now expected to add an additional 30,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate capacity by the end of 2025, or 10,000 metric tons more than previously announced. By re-engineering the use of fresh water, the second expansion will not require access to any additional fresh water. It also allows Livent to improve overall lithium yields and reduce water use intensity for current and future operations.\n\nLivent has also begun evaluating a third expansion in Argentina that would add up to 30,000 metric tons of additional lithium carbonate capacity. This expansion would deploy a more conventional pond evaporation-based process and require significantly less capital versus prior expansions. Following the third expansion, Livent believes it can reach total capacity at its operations in Argentina of 100,000 metric tons by the end of 2030.\n\nLithium Hydroxide\n\nThe Company announces that it expects to add another 15,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide capacity at a new location in China by the end of 2023. Additionally, Livent is evaluating building a new facility in either North America or Europe that would process lithium material from battery recycling processes into lithium hydroxide. The Company is exploring multiple opportunities for partnership and funding and believes the new facility could be in operation by the end of 2025, with production capacity of at least 10,000 metric tons.\n\nLivent is also nearing completion of its 5,000 metric tons expansion of lithium hydroxide capacity in Bessemer City that will start commercial production in the second half of this year.\n\nFollowing these expansions, Livent expects to have total lithium hydroxide capacity of at least 55,000 metric tons by the end of 2025 (excluding Nemaska), more than double its existing hydroxide capacity of 25,000 metric tons.\n\nNemaska\n\nYesterday, Livent announced that it has agreed to double its ownership interest in Nemaska Lithium Inc. (\"Nemaska\") to 50% by issuing 17,500,000 shares of Livent common stock. Nemaska is a fully integrated lithium hydroxide development project with 34,000 metric tons of nameplate capacity located in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including, among other things, the expiration of certain notice periods required by applicable law. For more information regarding the transaction, please refer to the press release issued yesterday that can be found on livent.com.\n\nGuidance and Outlook (2)\n\nLivent has significantly increased its guidance for 2022 financial performance. With no projected change in volumes, this is driven by higher expected realized prices across all lithium products. For the full year, Livent now projects revenue to be in the range of $755 million to $835 million and Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $290 million to $350 million.\n\n($ million) Revised FY 2022 Guidance Prior FY 2022 Guidance Actual FY 2021 Revised YoY Growth (midpoint) Revenue 755 \u2013 835 540 \u2013 600 420 Up 89% Adj.

We evaluate operating performance using certain Non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, which we define as net income\/(loss) plus interest expense, net, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization; and Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as EBITDA adjusted for restructuring and other charges, separation-related costs\/(income) and certain other losses\/(gains). Management believes the use of these Non-GAAP measures allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of its underlying business from period to period. The Non-GAAP information provided may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies because of differing methods used by other companies in calculating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. This measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income\/(loss) or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The above table reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from net income\/(loss). a.  Represents impact of currency fluctuations on tax assets and liabilities and long-term monetary assets associated with our capital expansion as well as foreign currency devaluations. The remeasurement losses are included within \"Cost of sales\" in our condensed consolidated statement of operations but are excluded from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because of: i.) their nature as income tax related; ii.) their association with long-term capital projects which will not be operational until future periods; or iii.) the severity of the devaluations and their immediate impact on our operations in the country. b.  We continually perform strategic reviews and assess the return on our business. This sometimes results in management changes or in a plan to restructure the operations of our business. As part of these restructuring plans, demolition costs and write-downs of long-lived assets may occur. Three months ended March 31, 2022 includes $0.5 million of severance costs for management changes at certain administrative facilities and $0.4 million for miscellaneous nonrecurring costs. Three months ended March 31, 2021 consists primarily of transaction-related legal fees and miscellaneous nonrecurring costs.  c.

The Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures \"Adjusted after-tax earnings\" and \"Diluted adjusted after-tax earnings per share\" provide useful information about the Company's operating results to management, investors and securities analysts. Adjusted after-tax earnings excludes the effects of special charges and tax-related adjustments. The Company also believes that excluding the effects of these items from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of its underlying business from period to period. Diluted adjusted after-tax earnings per share (Non-GAAP) is calculated using weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted.  a.  Represents impact of currency fluctuations on tax assets and liabilities and long-term monetary assets associated with our capital expansion as well as foreign currency devaluations. The remeasurement losses are included within \"Cost of sales\" in our condensed consolidated statement of operations but are excluded from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because of: i.) their nature as income tax related; ii.) their association with long-term capital projects which will not be operational until future periods; or iii.) the severity of the devaluations and their immediate impact on our operations in the country. b.  We continually perform strategic reviews and assess the return on our business. This sometimes results in management changes or in a plan to restructure the operations of our business. As part of these restructuring plans, demolition costs and write-downs of long-lived assets may occur. Three months ended March 31, 2022 includes $0.5 million of severance costs for management changes at certain administrative facilities and $0.4 million for miscellaneous nonrecurring costs. Three months ended March 31, 2021 consists primarily of transaction-related legal fees and miscellaneous nonrecurring costs.  c.  Represents legal and professional fees and other separation-related activity. d.  Represents incremental costs associated with COVID-19 recorded in \"Cost of sales\" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations, including but not limited to, incremental quarantine-related absenteeism, incremental facility cleaning costs, COVID-19 testing, pandemic related supplies and personal protective equipment for employees, among other costs; offset by economic relief provided by foreign governments. e.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, $2.9 million and $2.6 million of the interest on the 2025 Notes was capitalized, respectively. i.  The Company excludes the GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from the Non-GAAP measure of income, and instead includes a Non-GAAP tax provision based upon the projected annual Non-GAAP effective tax rate. The GAAP tax provision includes certain discrete tax items including, but not limited to: income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to operating results in the current year; tax adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency remeasurement of certain foreign operations; certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years; certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets and related interim accounting impacts; and, changes in tax law. Management believes excluding these discrete tax items assists investors and securities analysts in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to operating results thereby providing investors with useful supplemental information about the Company's operational performance. The income tax expense\/(benefit) on special charges\/(income) is determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which the special charge or income occurred and includes both current and deferred income tax expense\/(benefit) based on the nature of the Non-GAAP performance measure.\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in Millions) 2022 2021 Non-GAAP tax adjustments: Income tax expense\/(benefit) on restructuring, separation-related and other corporate costs $ 0.1 $ (0.5) Foreign currency remeasurement and other discrete items (3.9) (1.1) Blue Chip Swap gain 1.4 \u2014 Other discrete items  0.2 1.3 Total Non-GAAP tax adjustments $ (2.2) $ (0.3)\n\nRECONCILIATION OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES (GAAP) TO ADJUSTED CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS (NON-GAAP) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, (in Millions) 2022 2021 Cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 10.8 $ 12.7 Restructuring and other charges 0.2 0.2 Separation-related costs\/(income) 0.4 (0.7) COVID-19 related costs (a) 0.8 0.9 Adjusted cash provided by operations (Non-GAAP) (1) $ 12.2 $ 13.1\n\n___________________ 1.

If you want to skip reading about how and why lithium prices are skyrocketing, you can go directly to 5 Best Lithium Stock To Buy Now.\n\nLithium prices are rallying during the EV boom. As concerns about climate change and global warming alarm governments to take action, and the global economy transitions to electrified transport and abandons combustion engines, the demand for lithium is bound to skyrocket. The biggest industrial application of lithium as of now is its use in powertrains of electric vehicles. Every big player in the automobile manufacturing industry has announced its plans to go all-electric at some point in the future, with some targeting achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2035, and others planning all-electric fleets by 2050. Lithium manufacturers and miners are looking at lucrative days ahead, as the demand for lithium grows catalyzed by global EV adoption.\n\nGlobal EV Adoption\n\nAccording to Statista, even though a semiconductor shortage resulted in a rough year for the automobile industry in 2021, global electric vehicle sales saw a two-fold increase compared to 2020, peaking at 6.6 million up from 3 million. According to the EV volumes data, cited by the International Energy Agency, all net growth in global car sales in 2021 can be attributed to EVs. China was leading in 2021 having almost tripled electric car sales from 1.2 to 3.4 million. Europe was the runner-up region that reported new car registrations up by 70% from 2020, hitting 2.3 million, roughly half of which had electric powertrains. For the first time in history, new car sales crossed 1 million in the United States, and more than half of which were electric cars.\n\nStrong Demand For Lithium Ahead\n\nAccording to S&P Global Commodity Insights, the demand for lithium is expected to further strengthen in 2022. S&P Global Platts data shows that seaborne lithium carbonate prices went up by 413% in 2021 and hit $32,600 per metric ton last December. Lithium hydroxide prices gained 254% over the same period to reach $31,900 per metric ton. Lithium chemical supply is expected to hit 636,000 metric tons, up from roughly 497,000 metric tons in 2021. The demand for lithium is forecasted to grow to 641,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2022, up from 504,000 metric tons in 2021. This creates a deficit of 5,000 metric tons, down from a deficit of 8,000 metric tons in 2021, and according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, this deficit is expected to drive lithium prices to record highs in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoaring lithium prices have resulted in EV manufacturers pondering about creating their own lithium power plants. This April, a tweet highlighted the exponential growth of the price of lithium from $4,450 per tonne in 2012 to $78,032 per tonne as of April 2022. Shortly after, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), was reported to be talking about exploring opportunities for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to get into mining and refining lithium on its own unless prices for the commodity relax.\n\nProminent names in the lithium industry include Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS), and Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo determine the 10 best lithium stocks to buy now we looked for companies that are continually making progress with expansions of their facilities and are racing to become the go-to suppliers for major EV companies.

That compares with $2,350 at the previous sale in late October on the Australian miner\u2019s Battery Metal Exchange.\n\nThe surging prices are unnerving battery makers and EV firms. Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said this month that lithium had gone to \u201cinsane levels\u201d and is the \u201cfundamental limiting factor\u201d for EV adoption, adding the car giant might consider mining or refining it directly. Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the world\u2019s largest battery maker, said last week it had won exploration rights for a lithium clay deposit in China.\n\n\u201cThe pricing received on the BMX sales trading platform is indicative of the critical shortage that exists in respect of lithium raw material supply,\u201d Pilbara Minerals said in a statement. It\u2019s the company\u2019s fourth online spodumene sale.\n\nThe jump in the auction bid is roughly in line with the increase in lithium carbonate -- a chemical used in battery production -- in China. It started rising in the middle of last year as the global recovery from the pandemic coincided with a surge in EV demand.\n\nThe rally has lost momentum in recent weeks -- prices are currently at 467,500 yuan ($71,182) a ton, according to Asian Metal Inc. -- as the worsening virus outbreaks upended supply chains and clouded the consumption outlook. The auction result suggests Chinese lithium compound prices are unlikely to drop below 400,000 yuan a ton, Daiwa Capital Markets\u2019 analysts Dennis Ip and Leo Ho said in a note.\n\nStory continues\n\nMiners are cranking up production to meet the skyrocketing demand and also enjoying bumper profits. Chinese producer Ganfeng Lithium Co. reported a more than 600% jump in first-quarter net income from a year earlier, while Pilbara\u2019s share price rose as much as 6.5% on Wednesday.\n\nThe Perth-based miner said it plans to hold the auctions more frequently as it ramps up production at its Ngungaju mine in Western Australia. However, it also warned that virus-related labor disruptions may result in output being in the lower half of the 340,000-380,000 ton guidance for the year through June.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAn Entire Neighborhood Is Being Flipped by a Los Angeles Developer The 400 Airplanes That Russia Seized Have Become an Epic Insurance Struggle China\u2019s Biggest Covid Failure Is Not Deploying an mRNA Vaccine China\u2019s Campaign to Wipe Out Covid Is Crushing Its Economy Elon Musk Stakes a $44 Billion Claim on the Future of Free Speech\n\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/top-bid-lithium-140-musk-030403553.html","symbols":["PILBF.US","PLR.F","PLS.AU"],"tags":["BATTERY METAL EXCHANGE","BLOOMBERG","CONTEMPORARY AMPEREX TECHNOLOGY CO.

(TSXV: ETMC) (OTCQX: EEMMF) (FSE: OU7A) (the \"Company\" or \"E3 Metals\"), an emerging lithium developer and leading Direct Lithium Extraction (\"DLE\") technology innovator, is pleased to announce that the Company has engaged an engineering firm to begin the design work for its field pilot plant (\"Field Pilot\") which will utilize E3 Metals' proprietary sorbent.\n\nThe goal of the Field Pilot is to demonstrate a near commercial scale, modular design of the Company's ion-exchange DLE process under real world operating conditions. The Field Pilot will be tied into an existing well that produces brine directly from the Leduc Aquifer in the Company's Clearwater Project. This is the next stage of development, moving forward from the Company's DLE lab-pilot prototype which has delivered successful results of up to 97% lithium recovery across multi-cycle testing. On April 6, 2022, the Company announced it has begun the evaluation of commercial-scale manufacturing of its proprietary sorbent to be utilized in the Field Pilot. The combination of E3 Metals' sorbent technology with a scaled-up ion-exchange system operating in real world conditions is an important step towards de-risking and demonstrating the DLE process and technology at a commercial scale. This major milestone has the potential to unlock the value of a significant world class lithium resource in a secure and friendly jurisdiction.\n\nThe Company anticipates the design and final cost estimate phase to be completed within the next six months with construction to follow soon after. The design and construction of the Field Pilot likely will utilize conventional and established ion-exchange equipment which can be scaled to commercial capacities. Ion-exchange technology is used throughout the world in different commercial applications such as water treatment and water purification. This type of commercial equipment is available from multiple global vendors. The initial plan for the Field Pilot will be to operate in the Leduc aquifer over a six-month period to collect and analyze data to further validate the technology and operating parameters. This milestone will lead towards the Company's goal of commercializing its proprietary DLE technology and commercial production of lithium hydroxide from its Clearwater Project.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This significant milestone towards commercializing the E3 Metals' technology comes together from two main pieces, (1) our sorbent material, and (2) the Field Pilot, where the two combined form the full DLE process,\" commented the Company's CEO, Chris Doornbos. \"Our primary goal has been to develop a simple process, utilizing our proprietary sorbent together with a well-established, commercially scalable processes to help reduce the overall costs of extracting lithium from Leduc brines. We look forward to the design, and our goal of successfully operating E3 Metals' DLE Field Pilot.\"\n\nAbout E3 Metals Corp.\n\nE3 Metals is a lithium development company with 7.0 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) inferred mineral resources1 in Alberta and an NPV8% on its Clearwater Lithium Project of USD 1.1 Billion with a 32% IRR pre-tax and USD 820 Million with a 27% IRR after-tax1.

As electric vehicle (EV) adoption increases, the lithium market is expected to strengthen even further in 2022. Data from S&P Global indicates that prices for seaborne lithium carbonate climbed more than 400% in 2021. S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that lithium chemical supply is forecast to reach 636,000 mt lithium carbonate equivalent in 2022. In 2020 and 2021, this figure stood at around 408,000 mt and 497,000 mt, respectively.\n\nAs lithium becomes a sought-after commodity, the fight over control of the resource is also growing. A spokesperson of Chinese mining firm Tianqi Lithium told S&P Global Platts that it was becoming more difficult to obtain and control lithium resources as the \u201cstrategic significance\u201d of the material grew. Global EV sales are also increasing and therefore lifting the lithium industry. Platts Analytics estimates that light-duty EV sales will rise to 10.5 million units by 2025, up from 6 million units in 2021.\n\nAmid this boom, several lithium firms are seeking to boost capacity to meet surging demand. Lithium demand will climb over 30% by 2025, per conservative estimates. Investors seeking to profit from this activity should consider the best lithium stocks in the EV space.

To date, we have sold covered calls on Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) that have expired worthless four times, yielding a roughly 7% return on the equity position\u2019s current value or 71bps for the portfolio overall. The outstanding covered calls appear to be trending towards a similar worthless expiration. If they do, the covered call trades on Lithium Americas Corp.

A further $73.4 million of cash was collected in early April from a Mt Cattlin shipment that occurred in March Strong balance sheet and future cashflow expected to fund delivery of growth strategy\n\nSUSTAINABILITY\n\nAllkem has appointed a new Chief Sustainability and External Affairs Officer, Karen Vizental who will be joining the executive team in April 2022. Karen will lead the Allkem efforts to continually improve sustainability performance and contribute to decarbonisation.\n\nAs a founding core member of the International Lithium Association, Allkem is supporting a landmark project launched in March to develop a clear understanding of key ESG issues in the lithium landscape so they can be addressed on a global level.\n\nAllkem has been working with consultants to develop and deliver a Respectful Workplace Behaviours training program to all Allkem employees. Course materials developed for employees, contractors and leaders were recently piloted in the Perth office. This program forms part of a workplace culture assessment that is being developed at the group level.\n\nSafety performance\n\nThe Allkem group recorded a Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate at the end of the March quarter of 3.4 for the rolling 12 months. A Lost Time Injury occurred at Mount Cattlin. The worker has made a full recovery and returned to work and an investigation has been completed, including a site review of prohibited tooling standards.\n\nAll operations are now aligned in reporting of Significant (High-Potential) Events, as well as all events and field observations, using the Intelex reporting system. The medium-term focus is to enhance the investigation quality of these events and align the organisation\u2019s leadership to a high standard. The final Risk Assessments were completed in the Mount Cattlin Principal Hazard Management program which complements the Western Australian (\u201cWA\u201d) Government\u2019s new Work Health Safety legislation.\n\nCOVID-19 response\n\nBiosecurity Protocols across all global operations ensured resilient operations with minimal impacts. Protocols are reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with the relevant jurisdiction and the business continues to actively plan for and manage COVID-19 impacts across its global operations.\n\nCommunity and Shared Value Program\n\nAllkem is committed to regularly engaging with community stakeholders across all assets and providing positive and lasting benefits. The Shared Value team in Argentina provides long-term value to the local communities through initiatives based on five pillars; empowerment; transparency, education; health; local production and natural resources. Community engagement and consultation continues at the Sal de Vida project as well as ongoing projects associated with Olaroz.\n\nThe Mt Cattlin Community Consultation Group continues to meet every two months with two meetings held during the quarter. The James Bay project is also maintaining regular engagement activities with the Cree Nation of Eastmain, Waswanipi and Waskaganish as part of the ESIA and IBA process and with the ultimate objective to ensure long-term benefits to the communities.\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nMT CATTLIN\r\nSpodumene concentrate Ravensthorpe, Western Australia\n\nIn line with FY22 guidance, 48,562 dmt of spodumene concentrate was produced at 5.4% Li2O grade in the March quarter. As previously disclosed, this was slightly lower than the prior quarter due to head grade returning to its life of mine average.\n\nMining and processing\n\nMining activities during the quarter continued to source ore from the 2NE pit with pre-stripping activities continuing at the 2NW pit. Due to closure of the WA border for most of the quarter, total forecast mining volume has been revised down and as a result cash cost of production for FY22 has been revised down to US$380-410 tonne. Mining activities in the June quarter will prioritise ore and forecast production volumes will continue to be supplemented from low-grade ore stockpiles.\n\nStable processing volumes continued during the quarter and recovery of 57.5% was slightly higher quarter on quarter (\u201cQoQ\u201d) due to lower final product grade.\n\nSales and financial performance\n\n66,011 dmt of spodumene concentrate was shipped during the quarter at an average grade of 5.6% Li2O, generating revenue of US$143.8 million at an average sales price of US$2,178\/dmt CIF.\n\nCost and margins\n\nThe FOB cash cost of goods sold for the quarter was US$349\/tonne and gross cash margin for the quarter was 84% or US$1,835\/tonne (~US$121 million). This is expected to increase further with higher prices anticipated for the remainder of the June half.\n\nTable 1: Mt Cattlin operational and sales performance against FY22 forecast production metrics\n\nMetric  Units FY22 Forecast  Mar 22 Dec 21 Sep 21 Production  Recovery % 55 - 59 57.5 57.0 61.7 Concentrate produced dmt 200,000 - 210,000 48,562 52,225 67,931 Grade of concentrate produced % Li2O 5.5 - 5.7 5.4 5.7 5.7 Sales  Concentrate shipped dmt 66,011 38,071 89,640 Grade of concentrate shipped % Li2O 5.6 5.7 5.7 Realised price1 US$\/dmt CIF 2,178 1,620 796 Revenue1 US$ million 143.8 61.7 71.4 Production Costs Cash cost per tonne produced2 US$\/t FOB 380-410 349 324 351 Revenue and realised price are stated on a CIF basis to be consistent with Statutory accounting practices. Prior periods have been adjusted to this basis. Excluding marketing and royalties\n\nSales outlook\n\nStrong conditions in the spodumene market are supporting advanced discussions for spodumene concentrate pricing in the June quarter of approximately US$5,000\/dmt SC6% CIF on sales of approximately 50,000 tonnes.\n\nDrilling program\n\nAllkem will commence a three-phase resource extension drilling program in April which will total 147 holes for 32,685 metres of reverse circulation (\u201cRC\u201d) drilling with the aim of materially extending the mine life.\n\nDrilling in the first two phases will target the immediate extension to mine-life at depth. The first phase is aimed to convert 3.2Mt of inferred to indicated resource category and the second phase will test two pegmatite lenses along strike and at depth, immediately north of current mine operations. A scoping study will also be conducted to evaluate either the opencut or underground development of resource extensions. The third phase will explore ore body extensions to the SW of current mining operations.\n\nOLAROZ LITHIUM FACILITY\r\nLithium Carbonate Jujuy Province, Argentina\n\nProduction\n\nProduction for the March quarter was 2,972 tonnes, down from 3,232 in the previous corresponding period (\u201cPCP\u201d) due primarily to a scheduled 10-day maintenance shutdown during February. The shutdown included tie-in\u00b4s to interconnect the expansion assets with the existing site facilities. Battery grade lithium carbonate production for the quarter was 35% which was in line with sales requirements for this period, the split for the remainder of the year will return to approximately 50\/50.\n\nSales and financial performance \r\nQuarterly product sales of 3,157 tonnes of lithium carbonate included 44% of battery grade material, in line with customer requirements as technical grade product was delivered to Naraha for commissioning and future production at that site. The sales volume was up 4% PCP but down 4% QoQ.\n\nTotal sales revenue of ~US$86 million was up 109% QoQ and up 386% from the PCP. The average price received was up 118% QoQ to US$27,236\/tonne on an FOB2 basis reflecting strong market conditions.\n\nPricing for the June quarter is anticipated to be approximately US$35,000\/tonne FOB2.\n\nCost and margins\n\nCash cost of goods sold for the quarter was US$3,811\/tonne reflecting increased technical grade material sold QoQ (44% vs 65%), an increased Puna incentive and strong cost control even though inflation (~16%) again outran devaluation (~8.1%) for the quarter. Export duties for the quarter were US$949\/tonne reflecting the higher revenue.\n\nGross cash margin for the quarter was 86% or US$23,425\/tonne (~US$74 million) which is expected to increase further with higher prices anticipated for the June quarter.\n\nTable 2: Olaroz production metrics\n\nMetric Units Mar Q Dec Q QoQ % PCP Mar 21 PCP % Production tonnes  2,972  3,644 -18% 3,232 -8% Sales tonnes 3,157  3,293 -4% 3,032 4% Average price received US$\/tonne 27,236  12,491 118% 5,853 365% Cash cost of goods sold1 US$\/tonne 3,811  4,336 -12% 3,867 -1% Revenue US$M 86  41 109% 18 386% Gross cash margin US$\/tonne 23,425  8,155 187% 1,986 1080% Gross cash margin % 86% 65% 21% 34% 52% Export Tax US$\/tonne 949  444 114% 210 352%\n\nExcludes royalties, export tax and corporate costs\n\nStage 2 Expansion\n\nConstruction of the Olaroz Stage 2 Lithium Facility is progressing well. Commissioning of individual project components is continuing as they are completed. First production is anticipated in H2 CY22.\n\nBy the end of March 2022, overall project construction had reached over 77% completion. This includes a new lime plant with evaporation ponds now commissioned and operating with brine concentration underway for use in the Stage 2 carbonation plant. The key items yet to be completed included the carbonation plant, soda ash facilities and product finishing area.\n\nStandalone economic analysis of the Stage 2 expansion released on 4 April demonstrates a pre-tax NPV10%real of US$2.674 billion and pre-tax IRR of 192% on a 100% basis, based on an average FOB selling price of US$14,000\/tonne. Post tax analysis delivers an NPV10%real of US$1.704 billion and an IRR of 137% on a 100% basis.\n\nResource update\n\nThe 2022 Interim Upgraded Resource published on 4 April 2022, substantially expands Allkem\u2019s resource in the Olaroz basin from 6.4 Mt LCE to 16.2 Mt LCE, with 5.1 Mt of Measured resource and 4.6 Mt of Indicated resource, with the remainder in Inferred resource status (on a 100% basis). Total Allkem resources at the Olaroz and immediately adjacent Cauchari basins are now 22.5 Mt LCE in all resource categories, making it one of the largest lithium resources in the world.\n\nBORAX ARGENTINA\r\nBoron Minerals Salta-Jujuy Province, Argentina\n\nSales in Q3 FY22 of 12,184 tonnes of boron minerals and refined products represents a quarterly decrease of 5% and an approximate increase of 18% from the PCP (Table 3). Total sales revenue was up 7% QoQ with a 13% increase in the average realised price resulting from a concerted effort with customers to maximise recovery of increased costs due to inflation, higher reagent costs and higher fuel and logistics costs. Revenue was up 18% from the PCP.\n\nTable 3: Borax Argentina sales volumes\n\nUnits Current period QoQ % PCP PCP % March  tonnes 12,184 -5% 10,282 18% December tonnes 12,828 -2% 10,573 21% September tonnes 13,083 17% 8,964 46% June tonnes 11,188 9% 12,278 -9%\n\nDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS\n\nNARAHA\r\nLithium HydroxideNaraha, Japan\n\nConstruction of the Naraha lithium hydroxide plant in Japan is complete, with pre-commissioning works well underway. Following an earthquake on March 16, testing and inspection of the plant continues, however commissioning activities will continue during Q2 CY22 with first production expected in Q3 CY22.\n\nSAL DE VIDA\r\nLithium CarbonateCatamarca Province, Argentina\n\nSal de Vida is designed to produce a majority of battery grade lithium carbonate through an evaporation and processing operation at the Salar del Hombre Muerto site.\n\nOn 4 April 2002 Allkem announced a 40% increase to production capacity to 45ktpa in two stages, Stage 1 of 15ktpa and Stage 2 of 30ktpa from the previous three stages of 10.7ktpa. Economic analysis of the Sal de Vida project, based on average FOB selling price of US$17,485\/ tonne includes:\n\nStage 1 pre-tax NPV10%real of US$1.23 billion and pre-tax IRR of 50%; and Stage 2 on a standalone basis is pre-tax NPV10%real of US$1.81 billion and pre-tax IRR of 38%.\n\nProject execution\n\nConstruction of ponds and the brine distribution network for Stage 1 commenced in January 2022 with first production expected by H2 CY23. To achieve this, key focus areas in CY22 include:\n\nConstruction of non-process infrastructure, ponds and the lime plant Procurement for long lead items to meet the construction schedule Completion of tendering process for a 30% photovoltaic energy solution Progression of updated regulatory approvals to reflect increased production capacity of Stage 1\n\nProject execution later in the year will focus on commissioning the first string of operational ponds before commencing construction of the carbonation plant and progressing towards operational readiness. This schedule allows for brine evaporation to occur during plant construction, allowing evaporated brine to feed the plant once commissioned. It is proposed that once the commissioning of Stage 1 commences, the development of Stage 2 will occur in parallel.\n\nPiloting activities\n\nPilot pond operations are underway to validate and refine the design model for commercial scale operations through maintenance, testing and harvesting trials. Piloting activities will continue in CY22 for training purposes to support operational readiness for Stage 1 production.\n\nWellfield drilling\n\nDrilling results from the eight production wells completed in 2021 resulted in a revised Resource Estimate of 6.85 Mt LCE, a 10% increase from the previous statement in 2021, and a revised Reserve Estimate of 1.74 Mt LCE, a 34% increase from the previous statement, supporting a 40-year project life based on reserves only.\n\nJAMES BAY\r\nSpodumene Concentrate Qu\u00e9bec, Canada\n\nProject execution\n\nAllkem expects construction activity at the James Bay project to commence in H2 CY22 with commissioning to follow in H1 CY24. To achieve these milestones, key focus areas for CY22 include:\n\nFurther engineering activities to finalise design, equipment and plant configuration; Procurement of equipment, temporary installations and key contracts; Development of sustaining initiatives for local stakeholders; and Progression of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (\u201cESIA\u201d), Impact and Benefit Agreement (\u201cIBA\u201d) and regulatory approvals.\n\nBasic engineering has been completed and detailed engineering for the process plant has commenced as planned alongside the continued procurement process. Additional site investigation works including sterilisation drilling (for the final plant and infrastructure location) and further resource definition was also successfully completed with analysis and reporting expected to be completed during the month of April.\n\nThe ESIA was re-submitted to authorities in July 2021 to reflect the changes made to the project as presented in the 2021 Preliminary Economic Assessment released earlier in the same year. The clarification process is on-going with authorities and engagement with local communities and stakeholders continues, including the Cree Nation of Eastmain and the Cree Nation Government. Clarification requests received in January and February from both Federal and Provincial authorities were answered at the end of the quarter with technical information provided. Discussions were held with the Cree Nation representatives regarding the Impact and Benefit Assessment and will continue in parallel with the ESIA.\n\nLITHIUM MARKET\n\nDemand\n\nThe strong demand for lithium chemicals and spodumene concentrate experienced during 2021 continued through the March 2022 quarter.\n\nElectric Vehicle (\u201cEV\u201d) sales for the March 2022 quarter were estimated at ~2 million units, up ~70% compared to the PCP. EV sales in China alone were estimated at ~1.1 million units during the March quarter, representing a 150% increase to the PCP.\n\nDemand for lithium carbonate in China remained strong during the March quarter in response to dominance of LFP battery formats (lithium, iron, phosphate) in the domestic market which represented more than 55% of battery chemistries.\n\nSpot prices for lithium carbonate and hydroxide across all key geographies rallied to new records as limited uncommitted supply fell short of demand during the quarter. Spodumene concentrate spot prices also registered records during the quarter, approximately double the prices of the December quarter.\n\nContracted prices were gradually adjusted up to reflect tightening market conditions across the supply chain.\n\nAllkem\u2019s sales contracts of lithium carbonate negotiated at 2021 prices came to an end during the March quarter. In 2022, annual contracts that previously had a fixed price are now linked to contract indices and are adjusted periodically.\n\nSupply\n\nEstimated lithium chemical production in China during the March quarter was down by ~10% QoQ due to lower industrial activities arising from Chinese New Year celebrations and restricted supply of mineral feedstock. Spodumene concentrate volumes shipped to China from Australia were ~2.5% lower QoQ, whilst supply from local brine remained consistent with the previous quarter due to cold weather conditions.\n\nThe market dynamics resulting from an ongoing accelerated demand for lithium chemicals in China, in contrast to limited incremental supply, resulted in a supply deficit during the quarter which in turn pushed spot prices of lithium chemicals and spodumene concentrate to new records.\n\nFurther consolidation was observed in the lithium value chain during the March quarter with automakers announcing investments in downstream lithium chemicals.\n\nConcerns regarding geopolitical risks continued to intensify in the battery supply chain as the Russia-Ukraine conflict escalated during the March quarter. New investments expanding battery materials capacity in North America and Europe were announced during the quarter and governments continued to reinforce the importance of developing local supply of critical battery materials including lithium.\n\nCORPORATE AND FINANCIALS\n\nFinancial position\n\nAt 31 March 2022, Allkem corporate had available cash of ~US$421.3 million (excludes $73.4 million of cash related to a Mt Cattlin March shipment that was collected in early April), down from a balance of ~US$427.5 million at 31 December 2021. Mt Cattlin contributed US$34.0 million cash from operations (excluding the $73.4 million mentioned above) net of capex and working capital movements, partially offset by Olaroz Stage 2 project funding of US$13.5 million, Sal de Vida capex of US$7.9 million, James Bay development cost of US$4.8 million, Naraha project contributions of US$8.7 million, corporate costs of US$4.8 million and net costs from other projects of US$0.5 million.\n\nUS$7.9 million and US$86.8 million have been set aside as pre-completion guarantees for the Naraha debt facility and Olaroz expansion debt facility respectively. The US$86.8 million is available to Allkem to fund capex, VAT and working capital related to the Olaroz stage 2 expansion. A payment guarantee has been issued by a bank in favour of a stage 2 expansion supplier for US$19.15 million which is expected to reduce to nil during CY22 as deliveries occur and invoices are paid. Allkem has guaranteed 75% of such amount with US$14.4 million of its cash on hand. The US$40 million BNP Paribas debt facility remains fully undrawn with a maturity of December 2022.\n\nArgentina economic conditions\r\nThe official foreign exchange rate depreciated by 8.1% in the March quarter from AR$102.72 at 31 December 2021, to AR$111.01 at 31 March 2022. The accumulated 12-month period from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022 resulted in a ~21% devaluation of the AR$ against the US$.\n\nMarch inflation was 6.7% an aggregate of ~16% for the quarter. Inflation for the 12-month period from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022 was approximately ~55%.\n\nFigure 3: Inflation versus devaluation from April 2011- March 2022\n\nA chart accompanying this announcement is available at https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/752ddab3-c030-4cfb-b139-77a11e440175\n\nThis release was authorised by Mr Martin Perez de Solay, CEO and Managing Director of Allkem Limited.\n\nAllkem Limited\r\n\r\nABN 31 112 589 910 \r\n\r\nLevel 35, 71 Eagle St\r\nBrisbane, QLD 4000 Investor Relations & Media Enquiries\r\n\r\nAndrew Barber \r\nM: +61 418 783 701 E: Andrew.Barber@allkem.co\r\n\r\nPhoebe Lee\r\nP: +61 7 3064 3600 E:Phoebe.Lee@allkem.co Connect \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninfo@allkem.co\r\n+61 7 3064 3600\r\nwww.allkem.co\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICES\n\nThis investor ASX\/TSX release (Release) contains general information about the Company as at the date of this Release.

The estimate includes wellfields to ponds, the lithium carbonate plant, non-process infrastructure and various indirect costs detailed.\n\nOperating expenditure (OPEX) is estimated to be US$3,612 per tonne LCE for Stage 1. The OPEX is predominately made up of reagents and also includes labour, energy and transport costs\n\nThe variance in development capital from the 2021 Feasibility study is largely due to the upgrade from 10.7ktpa to 15ktpa of production capacity, an increase of scope and accuracy for the carbonation plant design and inflationary impacts. The variance of US$117.2 million includes an additional US$30 million for the additional string of evaporation ponds and US$68 million for the construction of the process plant. Cost increases from global inflationary pressures, COVID-19 impacts and longer execution lead times are also incorporated into this variance.\n\nLithium carbonate price forecast\n\nForecast battery grade and technical grade lithium carbonate pricing was provided by Wood Mackenzie who updated near and long-term price outlooks for all products in Q4 CY21.\n\nBattery grade carbonate demand increased by 38.6% CAGR between 2015 and 2021 and has remained the most widely consumed lithium compound and is used predominately in lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles. Technical grade mineral concentrates accounted for a further 9.6% of consumption in 2021 and are used in similar ceramic, glass-ceramic, glass, and metallurgical applications to lithium carbonate.\n\nThe rapidly growing use of LFP chemistries for cathodes will result in strong growth for battery-grade lithium carbonate. LFP cathodes are expected to be the fastest growing cathode chemistry, increasing its share from 30% to 47% by 2050, as the Chinese market continues to expand and LFP cathode increasingly become the material of choice for a large number of EV-makers. This will correlate to a growth in lithium carbonate demand of 10.9% CAGR between 2022 and 2032. Over the forecast period, demand for lithium carbonate is expected to grow at 6.2% CAGR, from 255.2kt LCE in 2022 to 1,381kt LCE by 2050. This demand is likely to be met primarily with supply from brine projects.\n\nDemand for battery grade lithium carbonate is set to exhibit strong growth due to the increasing use of LFP cathode chemistries. As demand growth seen in 2021 starts to slow and new supply enters the market over the next few years, prices are expected to gradually decline to around US$15,000\/t by the mid-2020s. As demand continues to grow, a larger deficit will emerge towards the end of the decade and contract prices will trend towards a long-term price of around US$19,000\/t.\n\nDemand for technical-grade carbonate from industrial sectors is forecast to grow in line with economic growth, technical-grade lithium carbonate, however, lends itself very well to be reprocessed into battery-grade lithium chemicals. This is an established process occurring in Chile, US, China and soon in Japan. The ability to re-process the product into battery-grade lithium chemicals will ensure that prices will increase in line with prices of battery-grade lithium chemicals.\n\nPROJECT ECONOMICS\n\nAn economic analysis was undertaken using the discounted cash flow method and was based on the data and assumptions for capital and operating costs detailed in this report. The evaluation was undertaken on a 100% equity basis.\n\nA royalty agreement with the Catamarca Provincial Government has been executed, confirming a life of project royalty rate at 3.5% of net sales revenue (revenue less taxes).

The Sal de Vida deposit lies within the \u201clithium triangle\u201d, an area encompassing Chile, Bolivia and Argentina that contains a significant portion of the world\u2019s estimated lithium resources. Catamarca is a proven mining jurisdiction, home to several successful mining operations and development projects such as Livent Corp and Minera Alumbrera.\n\nAllkem is de-risking the development of Sal de Vida by adopting a simplified flowsheet, utilising mature technology and by staging development to reduce project risk and allow cash flow generation from Stage 1 and other operations to support development of Stage 2.\n\nThe 2022 Feasibility Study focuses on Stage 1, which includes brine extraction, evaporation and processing operations onsite to produce 15,000 tpa of high-grade LC. The layout and development plan for Stage 1 allows for future expansion for subsequent stages. A pre-feasibility study (\u201cPFS\u201d) has been completed for Stage 2, a single staged expansion of 30,000tpa LC to bring the total capacity to 45,000 tpa LC.\n\nA number of experienced engineering and consulting firms were engaged by the Company to assist in the completion of the Feasibility Study and Technical Report in accordance with the Canadian National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. Stage 1 engineering has now reached a level of accuracy that is equivalent to the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering (ACCE) Class 2 for the wellfield and ponds; and Class 4 for the plant design. Stage 2 estimates are at a Class 4 accuracy level.\n\nGEOLOGY & MINERALISATION\n\nThe salar system in the Hombre Muerto basin is considered to be typical of a mature salar. Several salars in the lithium triangle contain relatively high concentrations of lithium brine due to the presence of lithium-bearing rocks and local geothermal waters associated with Andean volcanic activity. Such systems commonly have a large halite core with brine as the main aquifer fluid in at least the centre and lower parts of the aquifer system.\n\nSal de Vida\u2019s brine chemistry has a high lithium grade, low levels of magnesium, calcium and boron impurities and readily upgrades to battery grade lithium carbonate. Long-term hydrological pump testing under operating conditions has demonstrated excellent brine extraction and aquifer recharge rates to support the production design basis.\n\nRESOURCE AND RESERVE ESTIMATES\n\nProduction wellfield drilling\n\nThe production wellfield drilling program commenced in late 2020 to construct an additional eight wells in the eastern region of the salar for Stage 1 brine production and to explore the resource at depth. The drilling program which also entailed aquifer and pump testing reached completion in October 2021 and was monitored by consultants Montgomery & Associates (\u201cMontgomery\u201d) and Allkem personnel. Once drilling was completed, 10-inch diameter PVC casing, and slotted PVC well screen was installed. The constructed wells were air-lifted and clean brine samples were collected at the well head.\n\nFurther exploration and aquifer data on the hydrogeological settings of the salar was also obtained. The wells reached depths between 202 m and 307 m and five out of eight wells reached bedrock. The lithium concentrations recorded were significantly higher than the average lithium resource grade of 754 mg\/L and the reserve grade of 805 mg\/L (for years 1-6). The wells returned average lithium concentration ranging between 811 mg\/L and 936 mg\/L.\n\nBrine Resource Estimate\n\nMontgomery was engaged to estimate the lithium resources and reserves in brine for various areas within the Salar del Hombre Muerto basin in accordance with the 2012 edition of the JORC code (\u201cJORC 2012\u201d). Although the JORC 2012 standards do not address lithium brines specifically in the guidance documents, Montgomery followed the NI 43-101 guidelines for lithium brines set forth by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM 2014) which Montgomery considers complies with the intent of the JORC 2012 guidelines with respect to providing reliable and accurate information for the lithium brine deposit in the Salar del Hombre Muerto.\n\nDrilling results from eight production wells increased the depth of the basement model and the size of the brine aquifer, leading to an increase in Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.6Mt. The revised Mineral Resource estimate of 6.85 Mt LCE reflects a ~10% increase to the prior Resource of 6.23 Mt LCE.\n\nThe different resource categories were assigned based on available data and confidence in the interpolation and extrapolation possible given reasonable assumptions of both geologic and hydrogeologic conditions.\n\nBrine Reserve Estimate\n\nThe revised reserve estimate of 1.74 Mt LCE for 40 years reflects a 34% increase compared to the previous estimate of 1.3Mt LCE for 44 years. The difference of four years reflects the Company\u2019s development approach of two stages, compared to the previous three stages detailed in the 2021 Feasibility Study.\n\nThe updated proven and probable lithium brine reserves are based on the modelled system and results of the numerical modelling, the Proven Brine Reserve reflects what is feasible to be pumped to the ponds and recovered through the process plant during the first eight years of operation at each of the wellfields.\n\nThe model projects that the wellfields will sustain operable pumping for 40 years; 34 years of pumping from each wellfield has been categorised as a Probable Brine Reserve. The Proven and Probable Reserve estimate of 1.74 Mt LCE represents approximately 28% of the current Measured and Indicated Brine Resource estimate.\n\nThe current numerical model projections suggest that additional brine could be pumped from the basin from the proposed wellfields past a period of 40 years. However, recalibration of the model would be required after start-up pumping of each wellfield to refine the model and support this projection.\n\nAdditional information for the reserve estimation can be found in the Annexures.\n\nBRINE EXTRACTION AND PROCESSING\n\nFront-end engineering design (\u201cFEED\u201d) work for Stage 1\u2019s wellfields to process plant and non-process infrastructure has been completed for an initial production capacity of 15ktpa, later expanding in Stage 2. The process commences with brine extracted from wells extending to a depth of up to 280m in the salar. Brine will be pumped to a series of evaporation ponds, where it will be evaporated and processed at the onsite lithium carbonate plant. Project facilities are divided into four main areas including wellfield and brine distribution, evaporation ponds, the lithium carbonate plant and discard stockpiles.\n\nWellfield and brine distribution\n\nThere are two wellfields considered for production; one in the East and one in the Southwest. For Stage 1, only wells from the East wellfield will be used, while Stage 2 will utilise the Southwest wellfield. The location of the production wells were selected to reduce long-term freshwater level drawdown and maintain the highest possible brine grade.\n\nNine wells have been constructed for Stage 1, of which eight will be operational during the maximum brine pumping season, and one will be on stand-by. All wells will be connected through pipelines to a booster station that will be situated in a central location to the wellfield. The booster station will mix brine from the different wells and act as a brine pumping station to reach the ponds and provide a buffer for seasonal flow changes. The average flow from the brine wells to the first evaporation ponds will be approximately 159 litres per second (\u201cL\/s\u201d) for Stage 1.\n\nEvaporation ponds\n\nThe solar evaporation pond system will consist of a series of halite and muriate ponds, which will concentrate brine suitable for feeding the lithium carbonate plant. The ponds for Stage 1 will cover a total area of approximately 450 ha and Stage 2 will cover a total of 850 ha. These areas were calculated based on the expected evaporation rates and the production well flow rates.\n\nHalite ponds for Stage 1 will be arranged in three strings which will operate in parallel, each string will contain six cells plus a buffer pond with the flow from one pond to the next in series. Ponds of the same type will be connected through weirs, which will allow for constant natural flow from one pond to the next, maintaining brine levels in all ponds and reducing pump usage.\n\nEvaporation will result from the combination of solar radiation, wind, temperature and relative humidity. Halite salts (primarily sodium chloride) will precipitate at the bottom of the pond, harvested periodically and stockpiled in accordance with environmental requirements. The muriate ponds will have the same design basis and be located adjacent to the halite ponds. When the brine reaches a concentration of 21 g\/L, it will be stored in a set of concentrated brine storage ponds, from where the brine would be fed to the lithium carbonate plant.\n\nLiming\n\nThe halite ponds will feed evaporated brine to the liming stage to partially remove magnesium. A solution of milk-of-lime will be added to the brine inside mixing tanks, precipitating magnesium and removing other impurities such as boron and sulphates. The solids will be separated from the brine and pumped to a discard facility. The limed brine will be fed to a series of muriate ponds for further concentration. It will then be stored in the concentrated brine storage ponds to act as buffer ponds before the process plant, to accommodate seasonal flow variations and provide consistent feed to the process plant.\n\nLithium carbonate plant\n\nThe lithium carbonate plant is designed to produce 15,000 tpa of lithium carbonate in Stage 1, with Stage 2 enabling the production of an additional 30,000 tpa. This design is based on average brine supply of 920 m3\/hr for Stage 1, and an average lithium concentration of 21 g\/L in the softening feed. The plant will operate continuously with a design availability of 91%.\n\nSoftening\n\nBrine from the concentrated brine storage ponds will re-enter the process plant in the softening stage to further remove magnesium and calcium. The brine will be heated and sent to a series of six softening and mixing tanks to allow the brine to react with all reagents. The reagents will enable the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate, as solids within the brine. Press filters and polish filters will separate the liquid brine and precipitated solids to remove all solid contaminants. The lithium-concentrated brine will then be sent to storage tanks to feed the crystallisation stage. Solid contaminants will be sent to a filter cake tank to be re-pulped with the liming discards before reporting to the discard facility.\n\nIon exchange\n\nSoftened brine will report to a typical ion exchange (\u201cIX)\u201d circuit feed tank to remove the remaining calcium and magnesium ions and meet battery grade specifications. Hydrochloric acid will be used for stripping and sodium hydroxide or water will be used for regeneration of the IX resin.\n\nCrystallisation\n\nLithium-concentrated brine from the IX stage will be combined with sodium carbonate at elevated temperatures to produce lithium carbonate. The heated brine will feed a group of four crystallisation mixing tanks that will operate in series, precipitating lithium carbonate as a solid inside the solution. The solution will feed a thickener then a crystallisation cyclone cluster, to further remove liquid from the final product. The lithium carbonate solids will be recovered while the liquor will be recycled back into the process.\n\nProduct finishing\n\nThe purpose of the product finishing circuit is to perform the final physical operations required to make the lithium carbonate suitable for transport to customers. First, the lithium carbonate solids will be dried to <1% moisture, before being filtered and cooled. The solids will be micronised and iron contaminants will be removed magnetically. The micronised product will then be bagged for transport.\n\nSalt waste disposal\n\nDuring the evaporation phase the build-up of solid sodium chloride, magnesium, boron and sulphates will occur in the ponds. Over time the solids will build to a level where their removal is required to maintain a working liquid volume within the ponds. All ponds will be harvested on average once per year with the solids placed in storage facilities adjacent to the ponds. The estimated annual total of salt harvested and stockpile from the halite ponds is 1.4 million t\/a, and from the muriate ponds is 79,000 tpa for Stage 1 of the Project. For Stage 2, the annual salt harvest will be 2.8 million tpa and 158,000 tpa for halite and muriate ponds respectively.\n\nThe salt disposal facility covers ~300 ha for Stage 1 and 600 ha for Stage 2 and will consist of halite, muriate, and co-disposal stockpiles surrounding the halite ponds. All salt waste is of similar chemistry to the surrounding salar and no adverse environmental impacts are expected.\n\nFrom year two of production onward, both liquid and solid wastes from the process plant will be mixed in a tank located near the production plant and will be sent as a pulp to the co-disposal area. This setup will operate for the remainder of the Project life. Some halite salts will be stockpiled separately to be used as construction material for future evaporation ponds, further reprocessing or sold as a by-product.\n\nThe infrastructure in the salt waste stockpile and co-disposal areas will consist of:\n\nAccess roads to each stockpile and co-disposal area, accessible by trucks and light vehicles; and Containment system such as low-height berms, for any liquids that may permeate from the salt stockpiles.\n\nFinal product\n\nPiloting activities and operations at the pilot pond and pilot plant have continued to meet and exceed battery grade specifications and design parameters in line with commercial operations. Instrumentation and equipment were assessed, and continuous softening-IX-crystallisation operation was also achieved.\n\nProject economics are based on a production and sales volume mix comprising 80% battery grade and 20% technical grade. The operating intention is to maximise the production of battery grade however the 20% allowance for lower grade products is a prudent approach at this stage of the development.\n\nSITE LAYOUT & INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nThe Project\u2019s tenements cover 26,253 ha and all process facilities will be located in the southeastern sector of the Salar del Hombre Muerto. The East Wellfield for Stage 1 will be located directly above the eastern sub-basin of the Salar del Hombre Muerto over the salt pan, and the ponds for Stage 1 will be located in two areas directly south. Stage 2 will be located southeast of the Southwest wellfield.\n\nThe brine distribution system will traverse the salar towards the evaporation ponds will be located. The location of the ponds has been determined based on a number of a factors including optimal constructability properties and minimising earthworks, environmental impact and risk of flooding.\n\nThe processing plant for all stages will be located in the centre of to Stage 1\u2019s evaporation ponds. A road system, including ramps and causeways, will connect the processing facilities and provide access to all working areas.\n\nSupporting infrastructure & logistics\n\nThe following main facilities are planned for the Project:\n\nRaw water system Power generation and distribution Fuel storage and dispensing Construction camp to accommodate up to 600 people Sewage treatment plant Fire protection system Buildings for the process plant, reagent and product storage Various buildings for administration & site services Site roads, causeways, and river crossings Communications & mobile equipment Steam generation, water heating and & compressed air system Drainage system\n\nEarly construction commenced in late 2020, constructing key roads to the main process areas and upgrading the accommodation camp to host up to 330 people which is currently used by staff and contractors. The Project is also serviced by key infrastructure including major roads, rail, air and multiple seaports in Argentina and Chile.\n\nThe main route to the Project site is from the city of Catamarca via national route 40 to Belen, then provincial route 43 through Antofagasta de la Sierra to the Salar del Hombre Muerto. The road is mostly paved to Antofagasta de la Sierra and continues unpaved for the last 145 km to Salar del Hombre Muerto. This road is well maintained and also serves Livent Corporation\u2019s Fenix lithium operations and Galan Lithium Ltd.\u2019s Hombre Muerto Project.\n\nThe Ferrocarril Belgrano railway line is located 100 km to the north of the Project and the use of rail during later Project stages is a possibility. A public airstrip is located in Antofagasta de La Sierra and a private airstrip is located at Livent\u2019s Salar del Hombre Muerto operations.\n\nInternational cargo for Sal de Vida could use a combination of ports in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Chile. The Ports of Antofagasta and Angamos consist of deep-water port facilities serving the mining industry in northern Chile. The Ports of Rosario, Campana and Buenos Aires consist of large port facilities serving multiple industries in Argentina\u2019s main economic hubs.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS\n\nCarbon emissions management\n\nAllkem is committed to the transition to net zero emissions by 2035 and is progressively implementing actions across the group to achieve this target. Each project within the group will contribute to this target in a different, but site appropriate manner.\n\nIn prior studies, power generation at Sal de Vida was designed to be sourced from diesel generators whilst simultaneously pursuing and maximising a photovoltaic energy solution. Despite diesel power generation remaining in the current study, Allkem is targeting 30% of power generation for Stage 1 production to be sourced from photovoltaic energy generated by a site-based solar farm. The Company is currently in a tender process to install this hybrid solution for day 1 of Stage 1 production and this will be defined further in H2 CY22.\n\nAllkem will seek to further decarbonise the project by maximising this renewable energy source through its life. A standalone study for Stage 2 will also be undertaken with the intention of replacing all remaining site-based diesel generated power with natural gas. The design basis and infrastructure allows the project to move to a 100% photovoltaic energy solution when battery storage technology is certified to work at altitude.\n\nEnvironment\n\nAllkem is committed to the responsible use of water resources and minimising environmental impacts. The internally developed process flowsheet was selected partly on the basis it consumed significantly less energy and water than other conventional technologies.\n\nThe Sal de Vida Project will consume minor amounts of raw water, equivalent to 1-2% of the groundwater recharge to the system. There is no expected loss of water to communities in either their groundwater or surface water usage. Water monitoring takes place at seven different control points alongside nearby rivers in addition to periodic sampling to test flow rates, chemical and physical properties.\n\nAn environmental baseline study was performed covering areas such as water, flora, fauna, hydrogeology, hydrology, climate, landscape, ecosystem characterisation, and socio-economic considerations. This study was used to support the EIA and will be used to monitor any impacts from constructions and\/or operations. Collaborative and community water samplings continue with local communities and provincial regulators.\n\nA physical climate change impact risk study was completed in 2020. Overall, no material climate change risks were identified, and projections will continue to be used to inform project design.\n\nCommunity engagement\n\nAllkem is committed to regularly engaging with community stakeholders and providing positive, lasting benefits through employment opportunities, local procurement, and educational and health initiatives. As part of a two-year corporate social responsibility program agreed in 2019, the Company funded three projects to support the communities nearest to Sal de Vida. This includes the construction of the high school in El Pe\u00f1\u00f3n village, expansion of the primary school in Antofagasta de la Sierra and construction of a first aid facility in Cienaga La Redonda. A community office was established in Antofagasta de la Sierra in January 2020. Separately, a social baseline study including a perceptions test returned positive results about the Company and the Sal de Vida Project.\n\nSince 2021, Sal de Vida has been developing a \"Completion of education\" programme that benefits employees of the project, the communities of Ci\u00e9naga Redonda and Antofalla. This programme is carried out jointly through an agreement signed with Catamarca Education Ministry. Allkem aims to support local communities by maximising health, wellbeing and the procurement of local goods and services whilst upskilling and providing future employment opportunities. During CY21 Allkem undertook a number of initiatives including:\n\nIndustrial technical training program in Antofagasta de La Sierra, carrying out more than 43 courses attended by more than 600 people; The development of local suppliers in Antofagasta de La Sierra, establishing a local laundry service for Sal de Vida project; Implementation of Health and Wellbeing seminars in Antofagasta de la Sierra villages, which involved talks by medical professionals about the prevention and care of different conditions and pathologies in all communities\n\nAs at 31 March 2022, over 70% of the local employees are from Catamarca and Stage 1 will create approximately 900 full-time positions in the peak of construction and 170 full time position during stable Stage 1 operations.\n\nFurther engagement with the provincial government and stakeholders, including the communities of Antofagasta de La Sierra, continue in relation to project updates.\n\nRegulations and permitting\n\nSal de Vida Stage 1 of 10.7kpta is fully permitted after receiving approval from regulators in December 2021. This permit is being used for construction activities which commenced in January 2022 to build the first two string of ponds, the brine distribution system, additional camp capacity, process plant and non-process infrastructure.\n\nThe Stage 1 expansion to 15ktpa requires a permit for the additional, third string of evaporation ponds which covers an extra ~150ha. The revised EIA has already been submitted to regulators and is expected to be approved by August 2022. The plant requires minimum changes from the upgraded capacity and therefore consultation with regulators is straightforward.\n\nStage 2 will require a new EIA approval that will be submitted once the front-end engineering design and technical studies toto this stage are completed. A ground water permit is also in place, providing sufficient supply of water for all stages of operations.\n\nPRE-FEASIBILITY STUDY ON STAGE 2 EXPANSION\n\nSince the merger of Galaxy Resources and Orocobre Limited, Stages 2 and 3 from the 2021 Feasibility Study have been combined into a single expansion with production increasing to 30ktpa, a 40% increase compared to the previous combined capacity. The PFS has used the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum as the minimum engineering standard to be achieved and this is a prerequisite for the conversion of Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves.\n\nDevelopment of Stage 2 is supported by the design basis of Stage 1 and the additional processing capacity will be achieved by adding to the existing plant in a staged approach. Synergies are expected with labour, reagents and product handling. The PFS confirms capital and operating assumptions for the processing plant expansion and additional evaporation ponds according to ACCE Class 4. Project delivery synergies from continuity of engineering, and allocated contingency have not yet been determined and are expected to be realised as further work is completed.\n\nDevelopment capital and operating costs\n\nProject development capital expenditure for both stages combined is estimated to be US$794 million and incudes the same key design assumptions as Stage 1. OPEX for all stages is estimated to be US$3,280 per tonne LC, an 8% decrease compared to Stage 1 on a standalone basis.\n\nWhile the fundamental approach is to replicate Stage 1 with increased wells, pumps, evaporation ponds and plant capacity, it is expected that many synergies will be realised including project delivery and development capital and operating costs. Continuity of people, systems and processes, engineering efficiencies and targeted allocation of contingency are expected. However, the PFS level does not accommodate these expected additional synergies other than minor indirect cost reductions. Further upside is expected as more detailed engineering on these stages advance.\n\nProject Economics\n\nThe Feasibility for all stages demonstrates strong financial outcomes with a Pre-tax NPV10% real of US$ US$3.0 billion and a capital intensity of US$17,648 \/tonne per annnm LC.\n\nEXECUTION STRATEGY\n\nProject Schedule\n\nStage Pond construction commenced in January 2022 and Stage 1 first production is expected in H2 CY23. To achieve this, key focus areas in CY22 for Stage 1 include:\n\nConstruction of non-process infrastructure, ponds and the lime plant Procurement for long lead items to meet the construction schedule Completion of tendering process for a 30% photovoltaic energy solution Progression of updated regulatory approvals to reflect the increased production capacity of Stage 1\n\nProject execution later in the year will focus on commissioning the first string of operational ponds before commencing the plant construction and progressing towards operational readiness. This schedule allows for brine evaporation to occur during plant construction, allowing evaporated brine to feed the plant once commissioned.\n\nIt is proposed that once the commissioning of Stage 1 commences, the development of Stage 2 will occur in parallel.\n\nFunding\n\nFunding is expected to be provided through one or more of the following:\n\nexisting corporate cash; existing or new corporate debt or project finance facilities; cash flow from operations; strategic offtake partner(s).\n\nOfftake Strategy\n\nAllkem continues discussions with prospective customers. In line with the Project execution schedule, these discussions are expected to advance to negotiations throughout the course of the project. Interest and demand remains strong against the backdrop of a tight market, and Allkem seeks to target high growth regions and determine the optimal contracting arrangement at the time of product qualification.\n\nENDS\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICES\n\nThis investor ASX\/TSX release (\u201cRelease\u201d) has been prepared by Allkem Limited (ACN 112 589 910) (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cAllkem\u201d).

Porosity samples were sealed in plastic tubes and shipped to Core Laboratories in Houston, Texas, for analysis. Depth-specific brine samples were collected from the in-situ formation, ahead of the core bit. Four additional methods were used to obtain brine samples. Brine samples used to support the reliability of the depth-specific samples included analyses of brine centrifuged from core samples, brine obtained from low flow sampling of the exploration core holes, brine samples obtained near the end of the pumping tests in the exploration wells, and brine samples obtained during reverse- circulation air drilling. After the samples were sealed on site, they were stored in a cool location, then shipped in sealed containers to the laboratories for analysis.\n\nBorehole and well spacing is in general about 4 km in most areas, and is consistent with guidelines determined by Houston et al., 2011 for evaluation of brine-based lithium resources in salar-type systems. The drilling density was sufficient to demonstrate a high degree of confidence in the understanding of the location and nature of the aquifer, and brine grade both horizontally and vertically. The Sal de Vida area has been drilled and logged with vertical exploration boreholes and wells.\n\nThe resource was estimated using the polygon method. To estimate total amount of lithium in the brine, the basin was first sectioned into polygons based on the location of exploration drilling. Polygon sizes were variable. Each polygon block contained one diamond drill exploration hole that was analysed for both depth specific brine chemistry and drainable porosity. Boundaries between polygon blocks are generally equidistant from diamond drill holes. For some polygon blocks, outer boundaries are the same as basin boundaries, as discussed above.\n\nWithin each polygon shown on the surface, the subsurface lithologic column was separated into hydrogeologic units. Each unit was assigned a specific thickness based on core descriptions and was given a value for drainable porosity and average lithium content based on laboratory analyses of samples collected during exploration drilling. Correlation between depth and lithium concentration in the brine was observed further increasing confidence in the method. The computed resource for each polygon was the sum of the products of saturated hydrogeologic unit thickness, polygon area, drainable porosity and lithium content.\n\nA cut-off grade of 500 mg\/L of lithium was used. Hydrogeologic units within each polygon with lithium content less than cut-off grade were not included in the lithium resource calculations. The resource computed for each polygon is independent of adjacent polygons, but adjacent borehole geology was used to confirm stratigraphic continuity of the units surrounding each borehole.\n\nMining methodology ultimately would be via well pumping in areas identified as favourable for brine extraction. An on-site pilot plant demonstrated the ability to extract the lithium from the brine.\n\nDrilling information from the production well extensions have resulted in the increased depth of the basement model and have increased the volume of the lithium brine hosting aquifer.\n\nAdditional information for the reserve estimation\n\nThe methodology used to develop the estimated resources, is different to the methodology used to estimate the reserves, but consistent with the informal guidelines for lithium brines developed by Houston et al., 2012. Their document provides informal guidelines for estimation of Brine Resources and Brine Reserves, and their methodology is consistent with industry standards for characterisation of aquifers and wellfields.\n\nThe document states that key variables, \u201chydraulic conductivity, recovery, brine behaviour and grade variation over time, etc. and fluid flow simulation models\u201d are considered when estimating the Brine Reserve and determining economic extraction. Given the nature of brine, the same guidelines regarding well spacing and grade cannot be applied as if the deposit was a stationary (i.e. static) orebody. The guidelines regarding lithium brine deposits, as suggested by the Ontario Securities Commission (2011), were considered acceptable and applied by Montgomery during construction of the groundwater flow model used to estimate the reserve.\n\nWhere previous methods were used to estimate the total amount of brine, and therefore lithium in storage that could be theoretically drained in the entire mining concession, the method used for reserve estimation is completely different and focuses on the potential for retrieval of lithium via wellfield pumping in selected areas where pumping at relatively large abstraction rates have been demonstrated. As the brine is a mobile fluid, it is necessary to use a calibrated numerical groundwater flow model, respective of fluid density, to project future wellfield production and projected future brine grade.\n\nDue to various levels of uncertainty in conceptualizing any hydrogeological system, all groundwater flow models necessarily incorporate inherent uncertainty. To lessen the effects of uncertainty, good model calibration to observed field conditions is essential for judging confidence in model projections. However, even with reasonable short-term model calibration to 30-day, hydraulic testing of the brine aquifer that was conducted in late 2012 and in 2020, long-term model projections are less certain because of outstanding variables. These variables include locations of aquifer boundaries, lateral continuity of key aquifer zones, presence of fresh and brackish water that have the potential to dilute the brine in the wellfield area, and the uniformity of aquifer parameters within specific aquifer units. Although the numerical model was constructed to be reasonably conservative when data are scarce or assumed (i.e., law of parsimony), there is always a level of uncertainty associated with projections of long-term outcomes. Therefore, it is appropriate to categorize the pumping from the first six years of pumping at each wellfield as a Proven Brine Reserve. Although projections of long-term pumping past the first six years from the wellfields are less certain. There is a reasonable understanding of the hydrogeological system that over the long-term the projected pumped brine can be categorized as a Probable Brine Reserve for the remaining 34 years of pumping at each wellfield.\n\nIt is standard in the industry to recalibrate and update numerical groundwater models after start-up and during operation of the production wellfields. As the wellfields are pumped, long-term data for pumping rates, water levels, and brine chemistry are generated; calibration to these new data will improve the reliability and predictive capabilities of the model. Future probable reserve estimates may also be modified based on production pumping results, and projections from the recalibrated model may result in confidence category upgrades of Probable Brine Reserves to Proven Brine Reserves.\n\nStatement of Brine Reserves\n\nThe groundwater model simulates concentrations of TDS, which are used to derive concentrations of lithium by linear relationships developed for each wellfield. It is assumed that the relationship between TDS and lithium content is constant during 40-year period of brine production from the East and Southwest wellfields. In this manner, the concentrations of lithium on model projections of TDS in the brine produced from pumping wells in each production wellfield are estimated.\n\nUsing the numerical groundwater flow model projections, total lithium to be extracted from the proposed Southwest and East wellfields was calculated for a total period of 40 years, considering the three stages of the project and taking into account that each wellfield will be pumping for 40 years with a gap of two years between wellfields (East, Southwest (South) and Southwest (North)). The model projections used to determine the Brine Reserve that assumed increasing pumping from both wellfields, indicate that the proposed wellfields should be able to produce a reliable quantity of brine at an average annual rate of approximately 10,000 m3\/d (about 116 L\/s) in the case of the East wellfield and 18,000 m3\/d in the case of Southwest wellfield (about 208 L\/s). The average grade at start-up calculated from the initial model simulations used to estimate the Brine Reserve is expected to be about 810 mg\/L of lithium (East wellfield); average final grade after 40 years of pumping is projected to be 778 mg\/L of lithium (Southwest wellfield). Depending on how the wellfields are ultimately operated, these rates and grades may be different.\n\nUsing the groundwater model, the average TDS content of brine was estimated for each pumping cycle for each wellfield. After estimating the total lithium content for each time step and summing the amounts of lithium projected to be pumped during those time steps, a total mass of unprocessed lithium to be pumped from the wellfields was estimated.\n\nTotal mass values in 1,000-kilogram units (tonnes) of lithium were then converted to lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) units using 5.3228 as the conversion factor. Therefore, the amount of lithium in the brine supplied to the ponds in 40 years of pumping is estimated to be about 2.48 Mt LCE, assuming no losses during processing.\n\nModelling results indicate that during the 40-year pumping period, brine will be diluted by fresh and brackish water, so the pumping rates increase slightly with time, to meet the anticipated LCE tonnes per year for each wellfield.\n\nDuring the evaporation and concentration process of the brines, there will be anticipated losses of lithium. Therefore, because the total amounts provided in Table 13 do not include anticipated loss of lithium due to process losses and leakages, those values cannot be used for determination of the economic reserve. The amount of recoverable lithium in the brine feed is calculated to be about 68.7% of the total brine supplied to the ponds.\n\nAllkem Limited\r\n\r\nABN 31 112 589 910 \r\n\r\nLevel 35, 71 Eagle St\r\nBrisbane, QLD 4000 Investor Relations & Media Enquiries\r\nAndrew Barber \r\n+61 418 783 701\r\nAndrew.barber@allkem.co Connect \r\ninfo@allkem.co\r\n+61 7 3064 3600\r\nwww.allkem.co","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/sal-vida-capacity-increased-45ktpa-205700150.html","symbols":["AKE.AU","AKE.US","OROCF.US"],"tags":["COMPANY","DEVELOPMENT CAPITAL","LITHIUM CARBONATE","OPERATING COSTS","PROCESS PLANT","PRODUCTION CAPACITY"],"sentiment":{"polarity":1,"neg":0.019,"neu":0.915,"pos":0.066}},{"date":"2022-04-04T10:15:03+00:00","title":"The Battery Metal Really Worrying China Is Lithium, Not Nickel","content":"(Bloomberg) --\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 30-Year-Old Crypto Billionaire Wants to Give His Fortune Away China Finds New Virus Subtype as Daily Cases Exceed 13,000 Elon Musk Takes 9.2% Stake in Twitter After Hinting at Shake-Up Ukraine Update: More Talks Possible Even as Bucha Outrage Grows Ukraine Update: Kyiv Warns Russia Is Adding Troops in Moldova\n\nNickel has captured much of the limelight among battery metals in recent weeks, and understandably so. Wild price swings, including an unprecedented 250% advance over two trading sessions amid a short squeeze, and concerns tied to Russia\u2019s role as a key supplier have added to longstanding worries among automakers about securing enough of the material.\n\nEven so, it\u2019s another metal that\u2019s been causing concern in the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle market.\n\nChina\u2019s government last month hauled in a whole range of market players for two days of talks focused on halting a breakneck run-up in lithium, the metal that\u2019s vital for almost all rechargeable batteries and critical to the roll-out of emissions-free cars and clean energy.\n\nLithium carbonate in China jumped about 472% from a low last June to a record high on March 15, according to pricing provider Asian Metal Inc. An index of global lithium prices compiled by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence has surged almost 490% in the past year.\n\nAt the March seminar, which included industry groups, raw materials suppliers and battery manufacturers, China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, demanded \u201ca rational return\u201d to more typical lithium prices. Talks focused on supply bottlenecks, pricing mechanisms and what officials described as the healthy development of the country\u2019s new-energy vehicle and battery sectors.\n\nWhile similar interventions to manage soaring commodity prices have been common for coal and steel, it\u2019s a rare step in the electric vehicle sector and underscores Beijing\u2019s nervousness about the impact of rising lithium costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs my colleague Danny Lee wrote earlier Monday, automakers are already grappling with the hikes in raw materials. Several have raised sticker prices in response. By making electric models too expensive, they risk slowing the pace of adoption.\n\n\u201cThe industry is facing a very strong headwind from cost escalation,\u201d Brian Gu, president of Xpeng Inc., told Bloomberg Television last week. The Guangzhou-based producer last month raised the price of its vehicles by between 10,100 yuan ($1,572) and 20,000 yuan.\n\nVehicle manufacturers are suffering from \u201copportunistic price hikes,\u201d to lithium products, Nio Inc.\u2019s founder William Li said on an earnings call last month. He urged suppliers to consider the impact of higher costs on development of the EV industry.\n\nThe sector\u2019s challenges follow decisions to slow or halt expansions and new projects during a two-year lithium price slump through the middle of 2020. That, combined with Covid-19 disruptions, means additions to supply simply can\u2019t keep pace with rising requirements.\n\nDemand for lithium will jump fivefold by the end of the decade, according to BloombergNEF. Roughly $14 billion of investment is needed to finance lithium resource and refining capacity by 2025, plus another as much as $5 billion by 2030, BNEF forecasts.\n\nThere are some signs that governments, producers and consumers are now recognizing the scale of that task.\n\nTesla Inc. signed two recent supply pacts with developers of future projects in Australia, while Ganfeng Lithium Co. \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest producers \u2014 said last week it\u2019ll use record profits to support a huge expansion program, aimed at delivering eventual capacity of 600,000 tons of lithium carbonate equivalent, compared to production of about 89,000 tons now.\n\nChina\u2019s authorities have called for quicker development of a domestic lithium sector that already dominates world production, highlighting growth prospects in Qinghai, Sichuan and Jiangxi provinces. In the U.S., President Joe Biden last week added battery metals, including lithium, to a list of items covered by the Defense Production Act, meaning companies can access funding to boost output or to study potential new developments.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nApple Makes It Easy to Work Remotely (Unless You Work for Apple) Amazon Warehouse Workers Just Redefined What\u2019s Possible for U.S. Labor Cashless ATMs Have Grown Into a $7 Billion Marijuana Loophole The Can\u2019t-Lose Betting Strategy That\u2019s Taking the Gamble Out of Sports Gambling Trump\u2019s Favorite Postmaster Is Surviving Biden\u2014and Maybe Even Saving the USPS\n\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/battery-metal-really-worrying-china-101503604.html","symbols":[],"tags":["BATTERY MANUFACTURERS","BLOOMBERG","CHINA","LITHIUM CARBONATE"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.975,"neg":0.034,"neu":0.895,"pos":0.071}},{"date":"2022-04-04T06:00:00+00:00","title":"FIRST ENERGY METALLURGICAL HEAD SAMPLE ASSAYS 1.46 PERCENT LITHIUM OXIDE FOR AUGUSTUS LITHIUM PROPERTY TESTWORK","content":"VANCOUVER, BC, April 4, 2022 \/CNW\/ - First Energy Metals Ltd. (CSE: FE) (\"First Energy\" or the \"Company) is pleased to announce that it has received an update from SGS Canada Inc. in Lakefield, Ontario, Canada regarding progress and the next steps to be taken for the ongoing metallurgical testwork on the Augustus Lithium Property. The head sample being used for the testwork assayed 1.46 percent lithium oxide (Li2O).\n\nThe following are the highlights of the metallurgical testwork steps:\n\nThe head sample assayed 0.68% Li (or 1.46% Li2O), with < 0.01% total sulphur (S). An ICP multi-element scan and XRD on a head sample were still pending. Heavy liquid separation (HLS) testing showed favourable potential of using dense media separation (DMS) to produce >6% Li2O concentrates at specific gravity (SG) of 2.90 and above, at ~32% global lithium recovery, or 40% stage recovery. However, it was noted that the iron content in the spodumene concentrate was high, at 1.40% iron oxide (Fe2O3). Magnetic separation will be attempted to recover this iron. The laboratory is requested to proceed to DMS operations with a 1st pass stage at an SG of 2.65 to remove major silicate gangue minerals followed by a 2nd pass stage on the 1st pass floats at an SG of 2.90 to produce spodumene concentrate. The DMS concentrate will be split into 2 or 3 fractions to attempt to reject iron through magnetic separation and produce a final spodumene concentrate targeting >6% Li2O and < 1% Fe2O3 assays. The DMS middlings plus the DMS -0.5 mm fines will be combined for flotation testing and QEMSCAN analysis. The DMS operation if successful can result in lower operating costs for the project at the production stage.\n\nAbout Metallurgical Testwork\n\nThe goal of the testwork is to develop a preliminary process to treat the spodumene bearing lithium mineralized rock to conceptualize a flowsheet, produce lithium oxide concentrate, and generate a high-purity lithium carbonate product.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Company has shipped to SGS Canada Inc. in Lakefield, Ontario, a 200-kilogram sample which includes a 50\/50 mixture of drill core and surface samples with visible spodumene bearing lithium oxide mineralization.\n\nThe testwork approach will be to first develop a beneficiation process on the composite sample with the goal of generating concentrate >6% Li2O at maximum recovery. Dense media separation (DMS) and flotation will be the main two processes examined. Beneficiated concentrates from this work will be combined for extractive metallurgical evaluation. The main goal of this part of the scope will be to generate a high-purity lithium carbonate product.\n\nThe program is scheduled to be completed in 28 weeks' time period. As the testwork includes several stages, the Company will keep track of progress on each stage and will release interim results as they are received from the laboratory.\n\nAfzaal Pirzada, P.Geo., Geological Consultant of the Company, and a \"Qualified Person\" for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, has reviewed and approved the scientific and technical information contained in this news release.\n\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF\r\nFIRST ENERGY METALS LTD.\n\n\"Gurminder Sangha\" Gurminder Sangha\r\nCEO & Director\n\nNeither the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) nor its Regulation Services Provider accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release and has neither approved nor disapproved the contents of this news release.\n\nForward-looking Information\n\nExcept for the statements of historical fact, this news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of the applicable Canadian securities legislation that is based on expectations, estimates and projections as at the date of this news release. \"Forward-looking information\" in this news release includes information about the Company's information concerning the intentions, plans and future actions of the parties to the transactions described herein and the terms thereon.\n\nThe forward-looking information in this news release reflects the current expectations, assumptions and\/or beliefs of the Company based on information currently available to the Company.

Today, the LAC stock is back up to $37.05, and I\u2019m still as bullish as I was in November. In fact, with several big catalyst ahead of it, I\u2019d like to see Lithium Americas closer to $50 a share.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLAC Lithium Americas $38.22\n\nOne, Lithium Demand Still Outweighs Supply\n\nGovernments all over the world wants millions of electric vehicles on the roads. Plus, according to BloombergNEF, about two-thirds of autos will be electric by 2040. All as the world attempts to ditch internal combustion engines for emission free electric vehicles.\n\nThere\u2019s just one tiny problem. There\u2019s not enough supply to meet that kind of demand. That\u2019s because no one really saw this kind of demand coming.\n\n\u201cThere is the quadrupling of demand in just five years and probably a growth of six or seven times over 10 years. So, clearly the industry is not prepared today for that level of demand \u2013 the amount of incremental capacity that the industry needs over the next 10 years is at least 1.5 million mt and in terms of capital investment, will probably require $45 billion-$50 billion of investment into new projects or expansions of existing operations,\u201d said iLi Markets partner Daniel Jimenez, as quoted by S&P Global Platts.\n\nTwo, the U.S. Government May Offer Support\n\nThe U.S. government could soon throw its weight \u2014 and mone \u2014 behind lithium.\n\nThere\u2019s speculation President Joe Biden could invoke a Cold War-era defense law, all in an effort to boost domestic production of metals needed to make EV batteries. According to a Bloomberg report, that defense law could allow the government to use a $750 million Title III fund to help increase domestic production of essential metals and minerals, such as lithium. That could be extremely beneficial for companies, like Lithium Americas.\n\nStory continues\n\nThree, Lithium Americas May Be Close to Production\n\nAt the moment, Lithium Americas Thacker Pass project may be the closest to development, with plans to begin construction later this year. Should that happen, the LAC stock could double, if not triple on the idea it can help the U.S. meet more of its lithium needs.\n\nAt Thacker Pass, \u201cResults of a Feasibility Study on the first phase of Thacker Pass (for at least 30,000-35,000 tpa of lithium carbonate) are expected by year end. Engineering is underway to consider a 20,000 tpa lithium hydroxide chemical conversion plant, to provide flexibility to meet potential customer and partner needs,\u201d according to a recent company press release.\n\nI\u2019m also waiting on progress at its Cauchar\u00ed-Olaroz mine, which could see production later this year, and produce up to 40,000 tonnes per year.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWith global governments pushing for a greener future, we need as much lithium as possible. Unfortunately, there\u2019s just not enough supply to satisfy that demand at the moment. However, with a potential Cold War-era defense law, and news LAC is close to development, Lithium Americas could see significant upside potential, near-term.\n\nAs I noted above, \u201cGovernments all over the world wants millions of electric vehicles on the roads. Plus, according to Bloomberg NEF, half of all auto sales by 2035 will be electric. All as the world attempts to ditch internal combustion engines for emission free electric vehicles.\u201d\n\nRight now, that can\u2019t happen. Hopefully, Lithium Americas can help.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This should moderate within a year and then start coming down,\" he said.\n\nChandra did not comment on whether this would affect the company's sales or profitability but said that demand for \"green personal mobility\" was rising sharply and he expected to offset some of the costs by increasing the use of locally sourced components in its cars.\n\nAutomakers globally are facing inflationary pressures due to surging costs of nickel, cobalt and lithium that are used in making batteries - the most expensive part of an electric vehicle (EV) - as demand outstrips supply.\n\nThis has been made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and analysts say it threatens to slow the trend of falling battery prices which could hamper the broader adoption of EVs, especially in price-sensitive markets like India.\n\nIn India's nascent EV market, electric cars make up only 1% of total car sales. High battery prices and an insufficient charging network are the main reasons why there are few takers, and why more carmakers are yet to launch electric models.\n\nSpot prices for lithium carbonate, which is typically used to make lithium-ion batteries, surged to over $70,000 per tonne in March 2022 from about $10,000 a year earlier, according to data from industry forecaster Benchmark Market Intelligence.\n\n\"Going forward this inflationary impact is expected to continue,\" said Manish Dua, senior analyst at Benchmark.\n\nStory continues\n\nTata recently raised the price of its Nexon electric SUV in India by over $300 - a 2% rise for the base model, following similar moves globally by Tesla Inc and China's BYD.\n\nEven so, Tata, which has over 90% share of India's electric car market, expects sales of its electric cars to grow over four-fold this fiscal year from 4,200 units last year.\n\nThe EV maker sources lithium-ion batteries for its cars from Tata AutoComp Systems, which has a joint venture with China's Guoxuan Hi-Tech to produce them locally.\n\nChandra said as battery recycling gains pace there will be access to raw materials beyond mines and that will offset some of the cost pressures.\n\n\"Short term spikes will happen.

Expand to 100,000 tons by 2028\n\nSEOUL, South Korea, March 23, 2022 \/PRNewswire\/ -- POSCO Holdings started construction of a plant to commercialize brine lithium in Argentina. The POSCO Group is Argentina's first to produce lithium hydroxide for batteries through the entire process, from acquisition of mining rights to exploration to construction and operation of a production plant. POSCO Group's Brine Lithium Demo Plant in Argentina\n\nOn the 23rd, at the groundbreaking ceremony in Salta Province, Argentina for the brine lithium plant based at Salar del Hombre Muerto (Salt Lake), located at an altitude of 4,000 meters. Those in attendance included POSCO Group CEO, Jeong-woo Choi, POSCO Holdings Eco-friendly Future Materials Team Leader Byeong-og, Yoo, POSCO Argentina Head Kwang-bok Kim, Governor of Salta Province Gustavo Saenz , and Governor of Catamarca Province Raul Jalil, South Korean Ambassador to Argentina Myung- soo, Jang.\n\nCEO Choi's participation in the groundbreaking ceremony is the first step globally since the inauguration of POSCO Group holding company on the 2nd and the first on-site visit to the lithium facility, one of the group's 7 core businesses.\n\nThe brine lithium plant is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024 with an annual production capacity of 25,000 tons of lithium hydroxide. The total investment is about 839 million dollars (about 1 trillion KRW), including infrastructure investment and working capital. The construction and operation of the lithium plant and financing will be carried out by POSCO Argentina, a wholly-owned subsidiary of POSCO Holdings.\n\nIn addition to the lithium business, POSCO Group plans to increase the mass production to 50,000 tons from the end of 2024 through a second investment of 25,000 tons per year and expand the production to a maximum of 100,000 tons from the same lake by 2028.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 25,000 tons of lithium hydroxide that POSCO Group will produce annually with the start of operations are sufficient to supply about 600,000 electric vehicles. When production is expanded to a maximum of 100,000 tons, this volume can fulfill demand for about 2.4 million electric vehicles.\n\nWith the recent increase in global demand for electric vehicles, battery companies around the world are striving to secure lithium and POSCO Group has preemptively secured a large amount of lithium, a key material for batteries, thereby remarkably strengthening the competitiveness of POSCO Chemical's cathode material business. The battery material business has gained a clear upper hand in the world. Since cathode materials are mainly made of lithium, nickel, and manganese, securing adequate supplies of these raw materials leads to competitiveness in the cathode material business.\n\nThe POSCO Group preemptively took over Argentine salt lakes in 2018 in response to the prospect of a global lithium supply shortage due to the full-fledged electric vehicle era. Montgomery & Associates, a global brine lithium consulting company, confirmed at the end of 2020, that the lithium reserves, based on lithium carbonate in the salt lake, are 13.5 million tons, which is six times the 2.2 million tons estimated at the time of the acquisition.\n\nConsidering the mining possibility and yield, it is expected that at least 2.8 million tons of lithium carbonate will be produced. Because the lithium concentration in this salt lake recorded an average of 921 mg\/L, indicating that it has the highest lithium content among all of Argentina's salt lakes, and coupled with the lake's low concentration of impurities like magnesium, it is projected to have the world's highest yield.\n\nIn addition, by applying POSCO Group's independently developed lithium extraction technology, the company has secured global competitiveness in terms of productivity by dramatically shortening production time and improving yield. The currently skyrocketing price of lithium has reached five times the price when the lake was acquired (market price of $70,000 per ton of lithium). Considering the normal operating profit margin of 50% in the lithium mining industry, the lake is forecast to produce ten trillion won in accumulated operating profit.\n\nPOSCO Group plans to become one of the top 3 global companies in lithium production by 2030 based on the brine, hard rock, and recycling of waste batteries at the group level including POSCO Argentina, POSCO Lithium Solution, and POSCO HY Clean Metal, centered on the parent company, POSCO Holdings. On the 14th, POSCO JK Solid Solution, a joint venture with Jeong Kwan Co., Ltd., began using its solid electrolyte production technology on the first solid electrolyte production line. The process uses lithium in expanding the battery material business to the next generation of solid state batteries.\n\nOn the 21st, CEO Jung-woo Choi met with President Alberto \u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez, Minister of Industry of Argentina in the Federal Government Matias Kulfas, and Deputy Minister of Mining Fernanda Avila at the Presidential Palace in Buenos Aires where they discussed cooperation between the POSCO Group and the government of Argentina in the battery material business. The POSCO Group and Argentine government signed an MOU for enhanced business cooperation in the projected lithium plant expansion and etc.\n\nAlso on this day, CEO Jeong-woo Choi requested cooperation in the hydrogen and food sectors as well as the battery material business, and President Fernandez promised active cooperation. In addition, CEO Choi asked for support from the Argentine government for Busan hosting the 2030 Expo from the perspective of NGO diplomacy. POSCO Holdings Inc.

Russia is one of the world's biggest exporters of key raw materials, from crude oil and gas to wheat and aluminum, and the possible exclusion of supplies from the country due to sanctions has sent traders and importers into a frenzy.\n\nBase metals prices have been coming off recent highs (and in the case of aluminum, copper, and tin, all-time highs) set earlier in the month that were spurred by fears over the potential for disruption to Russia's metal exports following its invasion of Ukraine. Broad-based supply concerns remain, ranging from the potential for sanctions targeting exports, to actual output disruption and logistical dislocations (see 'Implications of the Russia-Ukraine crisis for metals' for details).\n\nBut the Ukraine crisis is only layering onto another more powerful trend: the global transition to low-carbon energy.\n\nThe energy transition is driving the next commodity supercycle, with immense prospects for technology manufacturers, energy traders, and investors. Clean energy technologies require more metals than their fossil fuel-based counterparts, with prices of green metals projected to reach historical peaks for an unprecedented, sustained period in a net-zero emissions scenario.\n\nBut few, if any, green metals have witnessed a price explosion as epic as that of lithium.\n\nAfter more than quadrupling in value last year, lithium carbonate continues to soar in 2022, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The mid-March assessment by the battery supply chain research outfit shows that battery-grade lithium carbonate (EXW China, \u226599.5% Li2CO3) is averaging $76,700 a tonne, up 10% over just two weeks and 95% since the beginning of the year. A year ago, the commodity was trading at $13,400 a tonne.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe rally in lithium hydroxide, used in high-nickel content cathode manufacture, is accelerating, up 120% so far this year, narrowing the discount to lithium carbonate, which historically is priced below hydroxide.\n\nBenchmark says that Chinese inventory levels for hydroxide, carbonate, and spodumene feedstock remain very low, sustaining the high price environment:\n\n\"Robust demand for material, and hence high prices, will be sustained in the near-term, with expectations that the seasonal recommencement of supply from domestic Qinghai brines in the coming months will provide little relief to the growing market deficit.\"\n\nMany investors who got burned by the last lithium price bust of 2018 have probably been watching on the sidelines, not sure what to make of the current mega-rally.\n\nTo be fair, China's spot market, where small tonnages can have big price impacts, may be accentuating the scale of this mega-rally, but make no mistake about it: this is no false flag, with everything from mined spodumene to high-purity hydroxide, and every component of the lithium processing chain experiencing a wild price surge.\n\nThe price explosion tells you that lithium supply is simply nowhere near enough to feed this demand surge.\n\nDemand Explosion\n\nThe last lithium boom five years ago was attributed to a failure by producers to anticipate the demand wave emanating from China's subsidy-driven roll-out of EVs.\n\nThe subsequent supply response, particularly from hard-rock spodumene producers in Australia, proved to be overkill leading to the price bust of 2018-2020.\n\nConsequently, new mines were mothballed, expansion projects were deferred, and many explorers folded operations and left to try their luck elsewhere.\n\nThen suddenly, in a classic boom-bust-boom commodity cycle, it happened: lithium producers have been caught flat-footed again, ill-prepared to meet the current even stronger demand surge fueled by the global energy transition and EV revolution.\n\nBut the ongoing lithium boom has plenty of steam.\n\nEV and new energy vehicle (NEV) sales in the pivotal Chinese market jumped 157.5% to 3.52 million units in 2021, marking robust growth in an otherwise lackluster domestic automotive market.\n\nMany electric buses in China have switched to lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Two years ago, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) introduced LFP batteries in its standard range Model 3s in China and dropped the starting price from 309,900 yuan ($48,080) to 249,900 yuan ($38,773). Last year, the EV kingpin Tesla announced that it's switching battery chemistry for all standard-range Models 3 and Y from nickel cobalt aluminum (NCA) chemistry to an alternative, older technology that uses an LFP chemistry. CEO Elon Musk has revealed that the improving energy density of LFP batteries now makes it possible to use the cheaper, cobalt-free batteries in its lower-end vehicles so as to free up more battery supply of lithium-ion chemistry cells for Tesla's other models.\n\nBut Chinese battery-makers are now discovering that you can play around with the metallic cathode mix as much as you want, but lithium still rules.\n\nIn a recent report, Benchmark Intelligence says that record-high Chinese lithium carbonate prices have pushed the costs of lithium iron phosphate \u2013 or LFP cells \u2013 higher than high-nickel cells on a dollar per kilowatt-hour basis, compared to a deep discount historically. Indeed, the analysts have warned that the chaos in nickel metal markets may spill over onto the metal's use in the battery supply chain, potentially reversing the LFP trend.\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nOil Rebounds As Market Fears Russian Supply Shock  The World Could See A Record-Breaking Oil Supply Shock  Huge Russian-Run Iraqi Oilfield May See Near-1 Million Bpd Output Boost\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/lithium-prices-nearly-doubled-2022-170000490.html","symbols":["CL.COMM","HG.COMM","KW.COMM","TL0.F","TL0.XETRA","TSLA.MX","TSLA.US","TSLA34.SA"],"tags":["BATTERY SUPPLY","ENERGY TRANSITION","LITHIUM CARBONATE","LITHIUM HYDROXIDE","METAL BUYERS","SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.941,"neg":0.058,"neu":0.865,"pos":0.077}},{"date":"2022-03-17T11:32:00+00:00","title":"Lithium Americas Reports 2021 Full Year and Fourth Quarter Results","content":"Lithium Americas\n\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 17, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC) (\u201cLithium Americas\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) has reported financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nArgentina\n\nCauchar\u00ed-Olaroz\n\nConstruction continues to advance with a revised timeline; currently the project is approximately 85% complete and commissioning is targeted to commence in H2 2022.\n\n1,500 workers are on site with 100% of the workforce having received at least two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Around the end of 2021, construction activities were impacted by COVID-19 Omicron disruptions impacting supply chains and availability of the main contractor. Activities have returned to normal and the Company continues to monitor the situation closely. Additional resources have been added to accelerate and de-risk commissioning and ramp-up timeline. Total capital cost estimates have been revised to $741 million (on a 100% basis), up 16% from $641 million, to reflect additional resources and manpower, engineering modifications and inflationary cost pressures.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, 76%, or $565 million, of the $741 million budget has been spent. Progress on the second stage expansion of at least 20,000 tonnes per annum (\u201ctpa\u201d) of lithium carbonate equivalent (\u201cLCE\u201d) continues to advance with additions to the technical leadership team and drilling program underway.\n\nPastos Grandes\n\nIn January 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Millennial Lithium Corp. and the 100% owned Pastos Grandes for total consideration of approximately $390 million. In February 2022, the Company hired Carlos Galli as Senior Director, Project Development, Latin America, to oversee the development planning for Pastos Grandes and integration and expansion of a team of over 50 workers based in Salta, Argentina.\n\nArena Minerals\n\nIn November 2021, the Company increased its strategic investment in Arena Minerals Inc. (TSX-V: AN) to approximately 17.4% for $10 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnited States\n\nThacker Pass\n\nIn October 2021, Measured and Indicated (\u201cM&I\u201d) Resource estimates were updated to 13.7 million tonnes (\u201cMt\u201d) LCE at 2,231 parts per million lithium (\u201cppm Li\u201d). See the Company\u2019s news release dated October 7, 2021 for full details. The Company continues to advance the Feasibility Study with an increased targeted capacity of 40,000 tpa lithium carbonate and incorporating a second phase expansion to reach a targeted total capacity of 80,000 tpa lithium carbonate. Results of the Feasibility Study are expected in H2 2022. The Company is continuing to optimize engineering to complete capital and operating estimates. Capital costs are expected to substantially increase due to the incorporation of increased scale, additional processing and related infrastructure changes, and the results of engineering and testing, as well as to account for external factors such as inflationary pressures and supply chain considerations The Lithium Technical Development Center is expected to be operational in Q2 2022 to support ongoing optimization work and to provide product samples for potential customers and partners. In February 2022, the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (\u201cNDEP\u201d) issued the final key state-level environmental permits: Water Pollution Control Permit, Class II Air Quality Operating Permit and Exploration and Mine Reclamation Permits. An appeal on the Record of Decision continues to advance through Federal court process with a ruling expected in Q3 2022. In February 2022, the Company announced that it submitted a draft application to the US Department of Energy for funding to be used at Thacker Pass through the Advanced Technologies Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program. Discussions continue with potential strategic partners and customers.\n\nCorporate\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the Company had $511 million in cash and cash equivalents with an additional $75 million in available credit. In December 2021, the Company completed a convertible senior note offering of $259 million at 1.75% due in 2027. Net proceeds were primarily used to repay the $205 million senior secured credit facility and remove security over Thacker Pass, and to repay in early 2022 $25 million outstanding on its subordinate loan facility. In January 2022, the Company began to work with IRMA (Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance) to pilot their new draft IRMA-Ready Standard for Responsible Mineral Exploration and Development. In February 2022, Richard Gerspacher joined as Senior Vice President Capital Projects to oversee execution of the Company\u2019s development projects. Most recently, Mr. Gerspacher served as Vice President and Projects Director for Fluor Corporation leading the development of an advanced stage lithium chemical project in Australia. In February 2022, the Company commenced the process to explore a separation of its US and Argentina operations, through the creation of a standalone public company focused on the development of Thacker Pass.\n\nTECHNICAL INFORMATION\n\nThe Technical Information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Rene LeBlanc, PhD, SME, Chief Technical Officer of Lithium Americas, and a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.\n\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\n\nSelected consolidated financial information is presented as follows:\n\n(in US$ million except per share information) Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 $ $ Expenses (46.1) (30.6) Net loss (38.5) (36.2) (Loss)\/income per share \u2013 basic (0.32) (0.39)\n\n(in US$ million) As at December 31, 2021 As at December 31, 2020 $ $ Cash and cash equivalents 510.6 148.1 Total assets 817.3 326.7 Total long-term liabilities (272.8) (127.3)\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, total assets and cash increased primarily due to the $377.4 million net proceeds raised from the underwritten public offering of common shares, partially offset by expenditures in the period.
