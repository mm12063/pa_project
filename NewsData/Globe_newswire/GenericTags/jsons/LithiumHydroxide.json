(TSXV: RCK) (OTCQX: RCKTF) (FWB: RJIB) (WKN: A1XF0V) (\"Rock Tech\" or the \"Company\") has entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (the \"MOU\") with materials distributor and service provider thyssenkrupp Materials Trading GmbH (\"thyssenkrupp Materials Trading\") in relation to establishing a strategic partnership to supply lithium spodumene concentrate. Rock Tech plans to refine the mineral from the end of 2024 at its proposed converter in Guben, Germany, into high-purity lithium hydroxide, a key element in batteries for electric cars and plug-in hybrids. Rock Tech Lithium Inc. (CNW Group\/Rock Tech Lithium Inc.)\n\nThe MOU between the two companies also includes a framework relating to the purchase of high-purity lithium hydroxide by thyssenkrupp Materials Trading for the battery market, as well as other by-products resulting from the refining process. Thus, the potential partnership is expected to promote a more resilient supply chain for lithium directly out of Germany, from raw material sourcing, to refining, to meeting demand of the automotive industry and growing electromobility demands.\n\nMarkus Br\u00fcgmann, Rock Tech's chief executive officer says: \"With thyssenkrupp Materials Trading we have found al global logistics and trading partner that gives us further security in the supply of spodumene. This is expected to give us a broader base for our input stream, which would take us a big step forward on the road to success.\"\n\nWolfgang Schnittker, chief executive officer of thyssenkrupp Materials Trading, says: \"The potential partnership with Rock Tech underlines the systematic expansion of our global trading activities in the international battery and electric vehicles industry. The trading of lithium products would add another very important raw material to our supply portfolio for the production of long-life batteries.\"\n\nSpodumene is one of the most important raw materials, amongst others, for the production of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles. For this purpose, the spodumene mineral must be refined into lithium hydroxide, which can then be supplied to cathode manufacturers for the battery industry worldwide. Cathodes are essential components of battery cells. The lithium spodumene concentrate will be used in Rock Tech's first converter in Guben, Germany, which is expected to produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide from 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nABOUT THYSSENKRUPP MATERIAL SERVICES\n\nthyssenkrupp Materials Services is the largest mill-independent materials distributor and service provider in the Western world, with around 380 locations - including around 260 warehouse sites - in more than 30 countries.

Some analysts expect them to peak this year, but with supply slow to respond to robust demand, that peak is far from certain. And this may slow down the energy transition that many governments are eager to help along.\n\nTesla has raised the prices of its car severaltimes since the start of the year. While the company does not normally announce reasons for the price hikes, CEO Elon Musk this month complained about raw material prices and supply chain shortages.\n\nIn an interview with a Tesla owners group, Musk said, \"Both Berlin and Austin factories are gigantic money furnaces right now,\" adding that he was worried about how Tesla would keep these factories running without going bankrupt.\n\nRaw material inflation is ubiquitous right now, but in some commodities, it is a lot more pronounced, and lithium is one of them. According to a Wall Street Journal report from this week, one big reason may be the pricing model for lithium.\n\nSpot prices for the most popular forms of lithium\u2014lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide\u2014have risen fivefold over the past 12 months, the WSJ's Stephen Wilmot wrote. Yet this has not attracted as much attention as the oil price rally, which, in absolute terms, was a lot more modest, because there isn't much of a spot market for lithium. And this, Wilmot argued, may be part of the reason why lithium producers are not in a rush to boost supply in response to strong demand from EV makers.\n\nNow, most lithium is sold directly by producers to consumers such as carmakers at fixed prices far below those on the spot market, Wilmot explains, but a growing number of contracts are now being indexed to the lithium spot market to reflect differences in volumes or in quality. The next step: a futures market.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated: Russian Refinery On Fire After Kamikaze Drone Strike\n\nA futures market would mean lithium trading has evolved and matured. It would mean there is enough stable demand for lithium to ensure future purchases in volumes big enough to merit mining expansions and new developments, theoretically. Yet a futures market would also need benchmarks, and this may be tricky. Because the biggest lithium market right now is China.\n\nThere is also the factor of time. Mature markets do not happen overnight, even when demand for the commodity\u2014or specialty chemical, as Albermarle, for instance, likes to call lithium\u2014is as great as the demand for lithium right now. And then, it will take time for supply to catch up after that market evolves.\n\nGoldman Sachs last month sparked outrage by calling an end to the bull market in lithium, saying that there has been a \"fundamental mispricing [that] has in turn generated an outsized supply response well ahead of the demand trend.\"\u00a0In other words, Goldman is arguing that supply is already greater than demand.\n\nNaturally, this prompted reactions, among them a note by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a firm that tracks and reports specifically on battery minerals. Among fundamental reasons, such as quality issues with much of the available lithium and geological challenges for new supply, Benchmark also made a note about prices.\n\n\"There is no single lithium price,\" the agency wrote this month, as quoted by Mining.com, explaining that the fact most lithium trading is done under fixed contracts while there's a spot market operating in parallel means it will be a while before spot prices and fixed-term prices begin to converge.\u00a0Until that happens, the imbalance between supply and demand will likely remain considerable.\n\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nChina May No Longer Be A Pillar Of Growth For Global Oil Markets  4 Nations That Could Help Solve The Global Fuel Crisis  Europe Faces \u201cRed Alert\u201d For Gas Supply As Russia Reduces Flows\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/soaring-lithium-prices-spark-demand-230000387.html","symbols":["TL0.F","TL0.XETRA","TSLA.MX","TSLA.US","TSLA34.SA"],"tags":["FUTURES MARKET","LITHIUM CARBONATE","LITHIUM HYDROXIDE","SPOT MARKET","SPOT PRICES","STEPHEN WILMOT"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.989,"neg":0.065,"neu":0.826,"pos":0.109}},{"date":"2022-06-23T21:00:14+00:00","title":"Stellantis invests \u20ac50mn in lithium start-up to secure car battery metals","content":"Stellantis will build a \u20ac50mn stake in Australian start-up Vulcan Energy Resources as it seeks to extract lithium from deposits in Germany and become the first European carmaker to make a substantial direct investment in the extraction of raw materials for batteries.

Company Announces Results of its Lithium-Bearing Tonopah Flats Exploration Drilling Phase 1 Program","content":"American Battery Technology Company Tonopah Flats Exploration Project Figure 1: Phase 1 Drill Program Locations and Figure 2: Phase 1 Ares of Influence\n\nAmerican Battery Technology Company Tonopah Flats Exploration Project Figure 3: Sampling results from exploration hole TF-2208\n\nReno, Nev., June 21, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Battery Technology Company,(ABTC) (OTCQB: ABML), an American critical battery materials company that is commercializing both its primary minerals manufacturing and secondary minerals lithium-ion battery recycling technologies, is pleased to announce positive drill results from its initial exploratory subsurface drill program, Phase 1, at its Tonopah Flats Lithium Project in Big Smoky Valley, Nev.\u00a0 This initial exploratory drilling program consisted of 16 targeted drill holes on ABTC\u2019s 10,340 acres of lithium-bearing claims, and was guided by surface sampling results collected in early 2022. \u00a0ABTC drilled approximately 7,895-feet in this Phase 1 program and based on these results the company intends to further expand these exploration efforts to continue to advance this project.\n\nABTC has developed its own proprietary processing train for extracting lithium from this type of unique Nevada-based lithium-bearing sedimentary claystone resource and for the subsequent manufacturing of this extracted lithium to battery grade lithium hydroxide for sale to the domestic battery supply chain.\u00a0 Whereas many proposed extraction processes are only able to produce economically competitive lithium products from high lithium grade material, the low-cost and low-environmental impact manufacturing process that ABTC has developed is able to produce battery grade lithium hydroxide from a wide variety of lithium concentrations hosted within these sedimentary resources.\u00a0 ABTC, in collaboration with DuPont, was recently awarded a $4.5M grant from the US Department of Energy to build and operate a multi-ton per day demonstration-scale system to accelerate the commercialization and scale-up of this critical lithium manufacturing technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nHighlights from this Phase 1 drilling program include:\n\nShallow Overburden: Anomalous lithium concentrations were measured at very shallow depths, less than 50 ft below the surface in many cases, indicating that low-cost and low-strip ratio techniques can likely be applied to access these near-surface lithium-bearing sedimentary materials Consistent Lithium Concentrations: Lithium concentrations above the reference cutoff concentration of 300 ppmw were observed in every drill hole, in consistent concentrations throughout a large percentage of the total sampled depths, and with significantly higher peak concentrations observed in many sample holes (see Table 1), which makes this deposit especially attractive to the internally-developed ABTC processing train Depth of Mineralization: The drilling infrastructure employed in these explorations was able to drill to a depth of approximately 500-ft, and in several of these drill holes the significant mineralization of lithium is still present at these depths, indicating that the anomalous lithium presence could extend even beyond the sampled depths (see Figure 3) Breadth of Exploration: With these initial 16 drill holes a wide breadth of ABTC claims have been explored, and when considering a 0.5-mile radius area of influence (AoI) around each drill hole, approximately 4,990 acres out of 10.320 acres of total claim area has been explored within this Phase 1 program Magnitude of Deposit: With the anomalous lithium concentrations observed throughout the detailed exploratory drill holes, and throughout the listed sampling depths, the ABTC team is excited to accelerate the further exploration and characterization of these claims to advance this deposit to an inferred, indicated, and measured resource through the established S-K 1300 guidelines Next Steps: ABTC will utilize the results from this Phase 1 program to develop a step-out drill program, Phase 2, to further characterize the deposit.\u00a0 Additional drill results on Phase 2 will aid in the determination of area-wide grade and thickness assessment of the in-situ amount of lithium in order to progress this deposit to a quantified resource\n\nTable 1:\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of Phase 1 Exploration Results\n\nDrill Hole Total Depth Drilled Thickness

stated ABTC CEO Ryan Melsert.\u00a0 \u201cWe are excited to have generated these high-potential results from our initial Phase 1 exploratory drilling program, and we look forward to expanding these drilling, sampling, mapping, geochemical, and analysis efforts to be able to fully define and quantify this resource moving forward.\u00a0 These sampling and characterization efforts provide the foundation for the validation and commercialization of our internally-developed selective lithium leaching and lithium hydroxide manufacturing technologies that are critical to solving our domestic and global critical battery metals challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe results from the first 16 drill holes indicate limited overburden with a significant near surface, 500-ft or better, thick lithium enriched area of mineralization,\u201d stated ABTC Chief Resource Officer Scott Jolcover.\u00a0 \u201cWe aim to maximize our step-out and build upon the initial drill hole program to shape our drill

While our holes are intentionally wide spaced at this time, the consistency of grade throughout the current results should lead to a very low strip ratio in a surface mining scenario.\u201d\n\nThe ABTC Tonopah Flats Lithium Exploration Project encompasses 517 unpatented lode claims covering approximately 10,340 acres.\u00a0 As part of the company\u2019s battery metals resource development exploration efforts, ABTC is performing bench scale characterization and extraction trials to confirm the technical and economic competitiveness of extracting elemental lithium from these domestic sedimentary resources in order to produce battery grade lithium hydroxide for sale to the battery metals market.\n\nQA\/QC Statement Drilling was conducted by Harris Exploration Drilling and Associates Inc., of Fallon, Nevada, utilizing Schramm reverse circulation equipment with a 5.5\u201d diameter hole with face centered bit, and by Drillrite LLC, Spring Creek, Nevada, using an Australian Air-Core Bit. Sampling was conducted using a cyclone splitter over 5-foot intervals. Sample custody was maintained by the company\u2019s consultants throughout the sampling and logging process. The company has a rigorous QA\/QC program utilizing blanks, duplicates, and a high and a low-grade lithium standard material. Duplicates and standard material are inserted into the sample stream, and blank material was inserted at the start and finish of drill hole sample set. Samples were analyzed by American Assay Laboratories in Reno, Nevada and Paragon Geochemical in Sparks, Nevada for analysis utilizing the ICP-MS analysis protocol.\n\nForward-Looking Information: Exploration Results There has been insufficient exploration of the relevant property or properties to allow for an estimate of a mineral resource.\u00a0 It is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a mineral resource.\u00a0 The exploration target therefore does not represent, and should not be construed to be, an estimate of a mineral resource or mineral reserve.\n\nAbout American Battery Technology Company\r\nAmerican Battery Technology Company, which recently changed its name from American Battery Metals Corporation, is uniquely positioned to supply low-cost, low-environmental impact, and domestically sourced battery metals through its three divisions: lithium-ion battery recycling, primary battery metal extraction technologies, and primary resources development.\n\nAmerican Battery Technology Company has built a clean technology platform that is used to provide a key source of domestically manufactured critical and strategic battery metals to help meet the near insatiable demand from the electric vehicle, electrical grid storage, and consumer electronics industries.

However, Piedmont\u2019s regulatory troubles have gotten it in hot water, which cast a shadow of uncertainty on its future.\n\nThe company doesn\u2019t have permits for its project from either the state or the local government. Moreover, it faces strong opposition from the Gaston County Board, which is responsible for granting permission to develop the mine. Despite everything hanging in the balance, PLL stock trades at a lofty valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nCBAK Energy Technology (CBAT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for CBAK Energy Technology (CBAT)\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh \/ Shutterstock.com\n\nCBAK Energy Technology (NASDAQ:CBAT) is an EV lithium-ion battery producer in Mainland China. The market is remarkably competitive, full of smaller competitors that continue gobbling up CBAK\u2019s market share.\n\nMoreover, the company\u2019s clientele market share is limited to a few customers, which account for over 50% of its sales. Hence, losing one customer will result in a huge blow to its fundamentals. Additionally, our stock has fallen out of favor with its investors, having shed over 70% of its value in the past 12 months.\n\nRecently, CBAK announced its acquisition of a troubled battery materials supplier in Hitrans Lithium Battery Technology. CBAK claims that Hirans generated roughly four times its revenues during the first nine months of last year.\n\n7 Unstoppable Stocks to Own in 2022\n\nHowever, filings have shown that the acquired company\u2019s financials are extremely weak, with large cash deficits. Hence, with plenty of uncertainties surrounding its business, CBAK stock remains a highly risky bet in its sector.\n\nLithium Stocks: Standard Lithium (SLI) a pile of lithium.

Therefore, the risk lies in its execution abilities and production process. SLI expects a whopping $1 billion in capital expenditures based on $4 billion in project returns.\n\nFeasibility information is lacking, which has led to massive uncertainty surrounding the stock. Moreover, it only has $100 million in cash at this time, which points to future dilution and debt increases.\n\nAmerican Lithium (LIACF) lithium (LI) on the periodic table. Lithium Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Lithium (OTCMKTS:LIACF) focuses on developing leading lithium projects in the Americas. It\u2019s a penny stock that gained incredibly in 2020 from multiple catalysts.\n\nHowever, the movement in stock price wasn\u2019t related to the company fundamentals. The company is a pre-revenue business that needs constant cash flow injections to stay afloat. Naturally, it could pay off in the long run if it hits big in the coming years. However, the chances of its success seem minimal at this time.\n\nLithium demand is expected to rise at a staggering pace over the next several years. Analysts at McKinsey report that demand for lithium could rise from an estimated 500,000 metric tons in 2021 to three to four million metric tons by 2030.\n\n7 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever\n\nHence, American Lithium and other lithium producers will continue to float up and down regardless of their competencies and quality of fundamentals.\n\nLithium Stocks: Tesla (TSLA) Tesla, Inc.

Its fundamentals are impressive from top to bottom, and have kicked into overdrive of late.\n\nWith the rising metal prices, Elon Musk recently tweeted about Tesla getting into the lithium mining and refining business. Musk said that though there is no shortage of lithium, the pace of refinement is slow. Moreover, the \u201cPrice of lithium has gone to insane levels.\u201d It remains to be seen how successful the business might turn out to be in terms of improving supply and limiting costs.\n\nNevertheless, TSLA stock\u2019s meteoric price remains a bone of contention, with it trading over 50 times enterprise value to EBITDA.\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov\/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) is a leading lithium conglomerate business that has been one of the most consistent performers in its niche. Its operations are highly diversified from a geographic standpoint, which gives it the edge over its competition.\n\nMoreover, the variety of locations it operates in gives it a unique advantage in dealing with different governments.\u00a0 The stability of its business is linked to the stability of its mines, which has plenty to do ALB\u2019s relationship with various governments.\u00a0 Nevertheless, it has established itself as a juggernaut in the sector, and it\u2019s in the best position to capitalize on the demand for lithium.\n\n7 Great Dividend Stocks Under $25\n\nThere are, however, plenty of risks to consider with ALB stock. Firstly, it trades at a nosebleed valuation of 4.70 times forward sales estimates. Moreover, it is always at the mercy of governments and institutions, which could significantly hamper its business.\n\nLithium Stocks: Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM) Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's web page on it.

(NASDAQ: AQMS) (\"Aqua Metals\" or the \"Company\"), a leading innovator in metals recycling with its AquaRefining\u2122 technology, has plated high purity cobalt and produced manganese dioxide from lithium-ion battery black mass. With the production of these two materials, the Company has successfully recovered all the high-value metals from used lithium-ion batteries, including lithium hydroxide, copper, and nickel, proving at bench scale its clean and economical metals recycling process. Based on the successful results to date, the Company has initiated the deployment of a lithium-ion recycling pilot at its Innovation Center in Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center that will begin operations later this year.\n\nUnlike other recycling processes that require multiple steps to produce high purity metals, Aqua Metals has proven at bench scale that its proprietary Li AquaRefining process can produce high purity individual metals more efficiently. These metals can be sold immediately or be processed into battery cathode precursor materials for lithium-ion batteries utilizing proven methods currently in use.\n\nIt is predicted that there will be 140 million electric vehicles (EV) globally by 2030, creating a massive demand for lithium-ion batteries and the critical minerals used to make them. In addition to higher costs, geopolitical risks, human rights abuses, and environmental issues associated with mining some of the metals used in lithium-ion batteries, mining alone cannot meet the supply demand of this exponentially growing market.\n\nRecycling the more than 15 million tons of lithium-ion batteries that are expected to retire between now and 2030 needs to be done sustainably to meet the carbon reduction objectives that the U.S., EU governments, and major corporations have set for themselves. Recycling also enables the retention of these strategic metals within the U.S., helping to defend against the at-risk supply chain for lithium-ion battery manufacturing.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe have proven at bench scale that we can extract high-quality metals with what we believe is the lowest environmental footprint of any lithium-ion battery recycling technology under development,\u201d said David Regan, VP of Commercial at Aqua Metals. \u201cAny company looking to partner with a battery metals recycling leader will appreciate that our fundamentally non-polluting Li AquaRefining process is expected to recover all the high value materials in lithium-ion batteries sustainably and more cost effectively than other recycling methods and mining.\u201d\n\nCobalt is one of the most expensive materials found in many lithium-ion batteries, and IDTechEx estimates that there will be cobalt shortages as well as supply challenges for lithium and possibly other materials in the next few years. Future materials shortages could increase the cost of these metals and potentially decelerate the transition to electric vehicles and energy storage without a rapid ramp-up of both mining and recycling.\n\n\u201cWith the successful completion of all of our metals recycling proof points at bench scale, we are rapidly deploying the fully integrated pilot at our Innovation Center located in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center this summer, and we expect to commence operations in the coming months,\u201d said Steve Cotton, President and CEO of Aqua Metals. \u201cWe expect that at the early pilot stage, we will be able to recycle six to ten metric tonnes (MT) of lithium-ion black mass per month with the goal of scaling to commercial demonstration quantities each month throughout the year and generating meaningful revenues for the Company by the end of 2023.\u201d\n\nAbout Aqua Metals\n\nAqua Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AQMS) is reinventing metals recycling with its patented hydrometallurgical AquaRefining\u2122 technology. The modular Aqualyzers\u2122 cleanly generate ultra-pure metal one atom at a time, closing the sustainability loop for the rapidly growing energy storage economy. The Company\u2019s offerings include equipment supply, services, and licensing of the AquaRefining technology to recyclers across the globe.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Stellantis N.V. STLA, Mazda Motor Corp. MZDAY, NIO Inc. NIO, Li Auto LI and XPeng Inc. XPEV.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nEV Roundup: Pacts on Lithium Access, More Carbon-Neutral Proposals\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) revolution is speeding up, with companies leaving no stone unturned to establish a strong foothold in this domain. Legacy automakers are stepping up e-mobility investment and setting ambitious targets to electrify their fleet. Last week, Stellantis N.V. inked a deal with a lithium resource producer to procure the metal's supply for its green cars. Meanwhile, Mazda Motor Corp. promised to make all its factories carbon neutral by 2035. China-based EV players NIO Inc., Li Auto and XPeng Inc. posted their vehicle delivery numbers for May.\n\nLast Week's News Highlights\n\n1. Stellantis entered into an agreement with Controlled Thermal Resources Ltd. (\"CTR\") per which the latter would supply battery-grade lithium hydroxide for use in Stellantis' North American EV production. CTR's Hell's Kitchen Project in California's Imperial County will obtain lithium from geothermal brines by using renewable energy and steam to produce battery-grade lithium products.\n\nStellantis will procure up to 25,000 metric tons per year of lithium hydroxide from CTR over a span of 10 years per the agreement. In late 2021, Stellantis had announced a similar deal to support vehicle production in Europe.\n\nPer the Dare Forward strategy, Stellantis aims to increase its planned battery capacity by 140 gigawatt-hours (GWh) to nearly 400 GWh and expand its hydrogen fuel cell technology to large vans in 2024. The Dare Forward 2030 promises to make the company a championed player in the domain of net-zero emission vehicles by driving innovation and employee engagement.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Mazda announced plans to make all its factories around the globe carbon neutral by 2035. This plan is part of its larger goal of making the supply chain carbon neutral by 2050. Considering its commitments to carbon neutrality, this Japan-based automaker has a long way to go. Mazda currently sells only one compliance-level EV and plans to continue selling combustion vehicles through the next decade.\n\nTo fight carbon emissions at its factories, Mazda has three key focus areas, namely energy conservation, a shift to renewable energies and the introduction of carbon-neutral fuels for in-house transportation. Energy conservation during the manufacturing process will comprise the reduction of thermal energy.\n\nMZDAY plans to switch to low\/carbon-free power generation in its plants and procurement of electricity from renewable energy suppliers. The company will work on its research on carbon-neutral bio fuels for use in in-house transportation. These measures will be implemented first at Mazda's Japan factories before other countries.\n\n3. NIO released delivery updates for May. The company delivered 7,024 vehicles last month, up from 6,711 units sold in May 2021. The deliveries in March comprised 1,707 ET7s, 746 ES8s, 1,635 EC6s and 2,936 ES6s. Cumulative deliveries as of May 31, 2022 totaled 204,936 vehicles.\n\nNIO's vehicle production and sales had been impacted severely in March and April 2022 owing to the resurgence of COVID-19 outbreaks and supply chain crisis. But deliveries seem to be gradually improving as sales in May rose 38.4% from the previous month. NIO remains focused on ramping up deliveries this month. As of May-end, the cumulative mileage of its EV fleet was more than 5 billion kilometers.\n\n4. XPeng notified that it delivered 10,125 Smart EVs in March, representing a 78% surge year over year. March deliveries comprised more than 4,224 P7 smart sport sedans, 3,686 P5 smart family sedans, and 2,215 G3 and G3i smart compact SUVs. As of May 31, 2022, XPeng's year-to-date deliveries were 53,688 vehicles, rocketing 122% year over year.\n\nAs China eased COVID-induced restrictions, XPeng resumed double-shift production at its Zhaoqing plant in mid-May and is actively seeking to accelerate the delivery of its robust order backlog. XPEV plans to launch ACC-L and LCC-L via over-the-air updates soon. As of April end, XPeng operated 954 charging stations, including 774 supercharging stations and 180 destination charging stations across China.\n\n5. Li Auto also released delivery updates for May. The company delivered 11,496 Li ONEs last month, representing a surge of 165.9% year over year. First-quarter deliveries totaled 31,716, jumping 152.1% on a year-over-year basis. The cumulative deliveries of Li ONE have touched 171,467 since the vehicle was rolled out in the market in 2019. As of May 31, Li Auto had 233 retail stores in 108 cities and 293 servicing centers in 214 cities.\n\nLi Auto notified that while its parts suppliers in the Yangtze Delta region have resumed production, they haven't yet fully recovered and thus Li Auto might be encountering challenges in the near term amid supply chain snafus. Consequently, the firm's Changzhou manufacturing base is also operating at sub-normal levels, which is likely to result in delayed deliveries.\n\nWhat's Next in the Space?\n\nStay tuned for announcements of upcoming EV models and any important updates from the red-hot industry. Investors are also awaiting the first-quarter 2022 results of NIO, scheduled to be released tomorrow.\n\nNIO currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

CTR\u2019s Hell\u2019s Kitchen Project in California\u2019s Imperial County will obtain lithium from geothermal brines by using renewable energy and steam to produce battery-grade lithium products.\n\nStellantis will procure up to 25,000 metric tons per year of lithium hydroxide from CTR over a span of 10 years per the agreement. In late 2021, Stellantis had announced a similar deal to support vehicle production in Europe. Per the Dare Forward strategy, Stellantis aims to increase its planned battery capacity by 140 gigawatt-hours (GWh) to nearly 400 GWh and expand its hydrogen fuel cell technology to large vans in 2024. The Dare Forward 2030 promises to make the company a championed player in the domain of net-zero emission vehicles by driving innovation and employee engagement.\n\n2. Mazda announced plans to make all its factories around the globe carbon neutral by 2035. This plan is part of its larger goal of making the supply chain carbon neutral by 2050. Considering its commitments to carbon neutrality, this Japan-based automaker has a long way to go. Mazda currently sells only one compliance-level EV and plans to continue selling combustion vehicles through the next decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo fight carbon emissions at its factories, Mazda has three key focus areas, namely energy conservation, a shift to renewable energies and the introduction of carbon-neutral fuels for in-house transportation. Energy conservation during the manufacturing process will comprise the reduction of thermal energy. MZDAY plans to switch to low\/carbon-free power generation in its plants and procurement of electricity from renewable energy suppliers. The company will work on its research on carbon-neutral bio fuels for use in in-house transportation. These measures will be implemented first at Mazda\u2019s Japan factories before other countries.\n\n3. NIO released delivery updates for May. The company delivered 7,024 vehicles last month, up from 6,711 units sold in May 2021. The deliveries in March comprised 1,707 ET7s, 746 ES8s, 1,635 EC6s and 2,936 ES6s. Cumulative deliveries as of May 31, 2022 totaled 204,936 vehicles.\n\nNIO\u2019s vehicle production and sales had been impacted severely in March and April 2022 owing to the resurgence of COVID-19 outbreaks and supply chain crisis. But deliveries seem to be gradually improving as sales in May rose 38.4% from the previous month. NIO remains focused on ramping up deliveries this month. As of May-end, the cumulative mileage of its EV fleet was more than 5 billion kilometers.\n\n4. XPeng notified that it delivered 10,125 Smart EVs in March, representing a 78% surge year over year. March deliveries comprised more than 4,224 P7 smart sport sedans, 3,686 P5 smart family sedans, and 2,215 G3 and G3i smart compact SUVs. As of May 31, 2022, XPeng\u2019s year-to-date deliveries were 53,688 vehicles, rocketing 122% year over year.\n\nAs China eased COVID-induced restrictions, XPeng resumed double-shift production at its Zhaoqing plant in mid-May and is actively seeking to accelerate the delivery of its robust order backlog. XPEV plans to launch ACC-L and LCC-L via over-the-air updates soon. As of April end, XPeng operated 954 charging stations, including 774 supercharging stations and 180 destination charging stations across China.\n\n5. Li Auto also released delivery updates for May. The company delivered 11,496 Li ONEs last month, representing a surge of 165.9% year over year. First-quarter deliveries totaled 31,716, jumping 152.1% on a year-over-year basis. The cumulative deliveries of Li ONE have touched 171,467 since the vehicle was rolled out in the market in 2019. As of May 31, Li Auto had 233 retail stores in 108 cities and 293 servicing centers in 214 cities.\n\nLi Auto notified that while its parts suppliers in the Yangtze Delta region have resumed production, they haven\u2019t yet fully recovered and thus Li Auto might be encountering challenges in the near term amid supply chain snafus. Consequently, the firm\u2019s Changzhou manufacturing base is also operating at sub-normal levels, which is likely to result in delayed deliveries.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nThe following table shows the price movement of some of the major EV players over the last week and a six-month period.

There\u2019s a looming shortage of the rare metal, a key raw material in the batteries used in electric vehicles. Elon Musk signaled Tesla Inc. might get involved in mining to secure supplies. Chinese and US companies engaged in bidding wars for Argentina\u2019s lithium resources, while Rio Tinto Group and Zijin Mining Group Co. are pouring more than a billion dollars into the country.\n\n\u201cIf Argentina didn\u2019t come through, it\u2019d be almost impossible for the lithium market to stay well-supplied,\u201d said Michael Widmer, head of metals research at Bank of America.\n\nArgentina has 13 lithium projects in the pipeline, more than any other country. The US has 10.\n\nThe world needs lithium supplies to grow fivefold by the end of the decade to meet projected demand as the electric-vehicle revolution gets into full swing, according to BloombergNEF. It could be Argentina's last shot at moving beyond its traditional offerings of soybeans, grains and beef to emerge as a global heavyweight in a new sector.\n\nThe country has 19 million metric tons of lithium resources that haven't yet been mined, twice as much as Chile. But Argentina has long struggled to lure the consistent, hefty international capital flows needed for mass development of oil, natural gas, gold and silver locked underground.\n\nStory continues\n\nPatagonian shale formation Vaca Muerta is perhaps the best example. A decade ago, it was all buzz and promise. There was a special exemption from capital controls that attracted Chevron Corp. But the trickle never became a flood: Argentina's broader woes and interventions in fuel markets kept development in check.\n\nNow, the world\u2019s largest lithium producer, Albemarle Corp., plans to restart exploration in the Salar de Antofalla in Argentina, a more remote and less developed area than Australia and Chile, where the company has been mining so far.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t always get to choose where our resources are. Now, the EV market is accelerating and demand is really growing, we need to develop that next resource,\u201d said Kent Masters, chief executive of Albemarle.\n\nIt\u2019s a tall order. A two-year price slump through the middle of 2020 had put some new mines on hold and had driven investors away, meaning that additional supply isn\u2019t growing fast enough now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more mature on the demand side now. You can bank on it more,\u201d said Jon Lamb, portfolio manager at a metals and mining investment firm Orion Resource Partners. Consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence expects the lithium market to grow to $40 billion by 2030 from just $1.2 billion in 2015.\n\nPosco Holdings Inc., one of the largest steelmakers, is investing $830 million in a lithium hydroxide plant in Argentina.\n\nSuch investment is crucial, considering that Australia and Chile\u2019s dominance in lithium is set to fade. While Australia and Chile account for 76% of output, their share in the project pipeline is only around 34%, BofA\u2019s Widmer said in a note.\n\nArgentina will overtake Chile in lithium production around 2027, according to Daisy Jennings-Gray, senior analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, which advises governments on critical minerals. Lithium Americas Corp. and Ganfeng Lithium Co.\u2019s Cauchari-Olaroz is likely to be the first new project to produce significant volumes in 2023.\n\nArgentina, Chile and Bolivia -- the so-called lithium triangle -- account for more than half of global resources, and are looking to cooperate on ways to move beyond mining the metal into producing higher-value products.\n\n\u201cThe three countries have different perspectives on how to produce the lithium, but we have a shared perspective on what to do next with it,\u201d Argentina Mining Undersecretary Fernanda Avila said. \u201cWe\u2019re working together to develop new technologies and techniques to go further in the value chain.\u201d\n\nWith history of capital controls, which Argentina uses to protect its foreign reserves, the country fights the perception of being \u201clike \u2018Hotel California\u2019. You can come in anytime you want, but you can never leave,\u201d said Andy Bowering of American Lithium Corp., which has a project in Peru.\n\nArgentina makes companies turn export revenues into pesos. It then stops them from freely accessing dollars or pounds again and moving them abroad. For instance, several commodities companies including top shale oil driller YPF SA had to re-finance dollar bonds because Argentina won't let it buy enough greenbacks to service debt. But with the country stuck for ways to grow the economy, especially in the mining sector, it recently created capital-control loopholes for big investors.\n\nThe world\u2019s hunger for lithium outweighs all the hesitancy, said Jon Evans, chief executive of Lithium Americas, which outbid China\u2019s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the world\u2019s largest battery maker, to buy Millennial Lithium Corp. last year. The three-way bidding battle for Millennial\u2019s lithium assets in Argentina lasted four months and included two Chinese suitors.\n\nArgentina \u201cis the best lithium opportunity in South America,\u201d Evans said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Thrill of Better Office Wi-Fi The Math Prodigy Whose Hack Upended DeFi Won\u2019t Give Back His Millions Compensation Is Becoming an Even Bigger Headache in the Remote-Work Era Open With Care: That Next Power Bill Could Shock You The Most Important Force in Food Has Nothing to Do With Fake Meat\n\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/hunt-lithium-sparks-frantic-rush-140401957.html","symbols":["LAC.TO","LAC.US","WUC1.F"],"tags":["ARGENTINA","BLOOMBERG","CHILE","LITHIUM HYDROXIDE"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.984,"neg":0.045,"neu":0.875,"pos":0.079}},{"date":"2022-05-17T12:30:00+00:00","title":"Critical Elements Successfully Produces Battery Grade Lithium Hydroxide in Pilot Plant Testing","content":"NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWS WIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES\n\nMONTR\u00c9AL, QC \/ ACCESSWIRE \/ May 17, 2022 \/ Critical Elements Lithium Corporation (TSX-V:CRE) (OTCQX:CRECF) (FSE:F12) (\"Critical Elements\" or the \"Corporation\") is pleased to announce the results from the Corporation's pilot plant program recently completed at the Metso Outotec Research Center, successfully converting spodumene concentrate from the Rose Project (\"Rose\") into battery grade lithium hydroxide using a thermal leaching process.\n\nThe pilot plant conversion process from spodumene concentrate to lithium hydroxide was further optimized and confirmed the previous strong results with extraction and conversion rates of 92 %.

Recent estimates from McKinsey suggest a global demand of around 3 million metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2030. In contrast, the total global LCE output for 2021 amounted to only 540,000 metric tons, a mere 18% of the anticipated need for 2030. These figures point to a potential shortfall in the future and questions are being raised over how this demand will be met.\n\nThe rise in this demand is attributed to an increase in consumer demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs). These EVs are requiring batteries that have higher energy densities and longer lifespans, the main component of which is high-grade lithium. The sudden rise in demand has caused raw lithium prices to skyrocket, leaving battery producers scrambling to secure their supply of a commodity that is quickly entering into a shortage. So this begs the question: Which companies are best positioned to take advantage? Mined production volume, modelled for 93% available capacity. Source: Minespans, McKinsey lithium demand model\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)\n\nAlbemarle is a global leader in the extraction and production of lithium, bromine and refining catalyst solutions. Lithium is undoubtedly the largest branch of the business, accounting for 42% of the US$3.3B in net sales for the 2021 calendar year. \r\nAt a current output of 88,000 metric tons of LCE per year, Albemarle asserts itself as a dominant player in the lithium market at 16% total market share. The company is poised to continue in a strong market popsition with plans expand processing infrastructure in 2022 and with the long-term goal of more than doubling their lithium production capacity. With this expansion pipeline, they'll be targeting low-cost juristictions to reduce capital expenditure and impove returns.\n\nHere are where we see Albemarle\u2019s competitive advantage lay:\n\nProject feasibility. Albemarle has proved it can already economically produce battery grade lithium in a period where lithium prices were much lower, illustrating the company\u2019s ability to continue operations should lithium prices fall. Ability to be self-funded. Albemarle's lithium branch is already profit making, so earnings can be retained and capital can be invested into the aforementioned expansion projects without the need for significant capital raises or taking on large amounts of debt. Smaller companies and emerging players will have to undergo financing stages which carry risks and may result in shareholder dilution.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlbemarle has a firm grasp on the market and seems positioned to continue riding this lithium wave from strength to strength. But these factors don\u2019t paint the full picture and investors should always consider the financials of a company to inform their assessment.

Producing 101,000 metric tons of LCE during 2021, SQM\u2019s impressive output accounts for 18.7% of global lithium production for the year and with several project expansions in the works, this output will continue to scale with the market demand.\n\nAccording to SQM\u2019s latest earnings report, 2022 sales estimates top out at 140,000 metric tons of lithium, with capacity potentially reaching 190,000-200,000 should expansion projects be completed in time, and dependant on the market demand for lithium.\n\nHere are the key factors driving the company forward in the next few years:\n\nSignificant Expansion pipeline. With SQM\u2019s joint venture in Mt Holland expecting to enter production in 2024 and a drastic increase to the production capabilities of their Salar del Carmen project, there\u2019s ample opportunity for the company to grow their presence in the market and beat out new entrants. Variable exposure to lithium prices. Looking forward to 2022, SQM\u2019s sales contracts are detailed as follows: 20% fixed or variable price, 50% variable price with a ceiling and 30% not contracted. This means that SQM will still be exposed to the increase in lithium prices on previously negotiated contracts even if the price of lithium was lower at the time the contract was agreed upon, opening the company up to increased revenues.\n\nInvestors should always consider the risks and financial health of a company to inform their investment decision. You can see our rundown of SQM\u2019s risks and financials for free on our website .\n\nLivent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM)\n\nLivent\u2019s premier resource is located in Salar Del Hombre Muerto in Argentina, achieving a reasonable current output of 27,000 metric tons of Lithium Carbonate and Lithium Chloride. While this is modest in comparison to the big players in the sector, expansion is at the forefront of the company\u2019s mission, with a 20,0000 metric tons expansion of their Argentinian operation slated for 2023 and a further 20,000 metric tons anticipated for 2025.\n\nLivent\u2019s production figures account for around 5% of the total market share. While this lags the other two companies, Livent\u2019s key focus on cost leadership within the production of LCE, Lithium Hydroxide and Lithium Chloride should provide an advantage over its peers.\n\nThese are the factors that are important to the performance of Livent:\n\nLow cost focus. High lithium prices can make many more projects economically feasible, but striving for lower operating costs will mean a project can weather the storm if demand and prices fall. By securing a low-impurity lithium resource, Livent has allowed processing costs to be cut, giving a competitive advantage over other brine operations. Exposure to Lithium Carbonate, Lithium Chloride and Lithium Hydroxide prices. New high-density batteries are more compatible with lithium hydroxide owing to greater nickel content in the cathodes. Should primary lithium demand switch from carbonate to hydroxide, Livent\u2019s exposure to the prices in both products should help it navigate pricing volatility.\n\nLivent is a smaller company and that does carry some possible risks. Investors who are interested in finding out more can do so for free on our website .\n\nThe Future Prospects\n\nWhen you take a step back and look at the global lithium sector, you begin to see a trend. Most supply comes from a select few companies, leaving a mass of newcomers are scrambling to secure funding to bring their projects to market. After all, there\u2019s no shortage of lithium resources on Earth, just a shortage of processing power to extract it from the ground and refine it. New companies coming to the table will reach maturity and begin reaping the rewards of their capital investments. These next few companies aren\u2019t generating significant revenues but we believe they\u2019ll be ones to watch.\n\nLithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC)\n\nLithium Americas is an emerging player in the sector. Their flagship project is their Cauchari-Olaroz brine resource in Argentina, which is currently 85% through the construction of its Stage 1 production facility, targeting 40,000 metric tons per annum (tpa) of battery-grade lithium carbonate. Lithium Americas is striving for cost leadership, forecasting operating expenditure of US$3,600 per metric tonne. With a project life of 40 years and a second stage expansion already on the cards, there is plenty to keep investors following their developments closely.\n\nHere are some of the Lithium Americas\u2019 most eye-catching features:\n\nCompleted acquisition of Millennial Lithium in January 2022. Lithium Americas now has 100% ownership of the advanced-stage Pastos Grandes project, which is located nearby to their Cauchar\u00ed-Olaroz tenements. The transaction was completed for around US$400 million and provides Lithium Americas with exposure to a rich brine resource of 4.1 million metric tonnes of LCE. Continued development of Thacker Pass resource. Lithium Americas has a 100% stake in one of the largest resources in the United States. The project\u2019s feasibility study is due in the second half of 2022, targeting 40,000 tpa of lithium carbonate, with scenarios being assessed for expansion up to a total of 80,0000 tpa. Preparation work to begin construction of the initial infrastructure is set to commence in 2022.\n\nFor those who are eager to find out more, you can do so by taking a look at the future growth section in our company report for Lithium Americas on our website .\n\nPiedmont Lithium Inc. (NASDAQ:PLL)\n\nPiedmont Lithium Inc. is a lithium company looking to develop key strategic assets in North Carolina, Quebec and Ghana. With a consolidated enterprise targeting 60,000 tonnes of LiOH per year and an additional 390,000 tonnes per year in spodumene concentrate (SC6) production, Piedmont is looking to become a significant player in America\u2019s shift to newer energy initiatives.\n\nHere is why Piedmont Lithium\u2019s future may become interesting:\n\nEntered into a binding agreement with Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to supply spodumene concentrate from their North Carolina project. The agreement is for an initial five-year term on a fixed price commitment representing one-third of Piedmont\u2019s planned production from their North Carolina project. Deliveries planned to begin between July 2022 and July 2023, but timeline has been postponed indefinitely due to delays in development. The Carolina project offers industry leading sustainability with close proximity to a key target market. Piedmont owns 100% of the project which is set to lead the way in terms of cost and sustainability, offering much lower direct water usage in the processing of lithium hydroxide, requiring only 6,300 gallons per tonne of LiOH. Compare this to Chilean projects in the Atacama region which need up to 124,000 gallons of water per tonne, it\u2019s clear to see where the benefits lay for Piedmont as water scarcity continues to be a frequent discussion point into the future.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to find out about the growth estimates for Piedmont Lithium Inc.

As regards volume, it stuck by its previous guidance of an increase in output of between 20% and 30%, as it ramps up production at its Wodgina mine in Australia. It then expects lithium output to double between 2023 and 2025 to around 200,000 tons, with a slight preponderance of lithium hydroxide over lithium carbonate.\n\nThe company now sees full-year earnings per share at between $9.25 and $12.25, up from a prior estimate of $5.65 to $6.65. Net cash from operations is now seen as high as $800 million this year. That cash flow is on course to cut the company's net debt to less than two times EBITDA from a multiple of 2.3 times at the end of 2021. It will also fund an increase of over 40% in capital expenditure to around $1.4 billion.\n\nNet sales, meanwhile, are now expected between $5.2 billion and $5.6 billion, well above a prior consensus of around $4.4 billion.\n\nAlbemarle stock stood out on a morning when the broader market was again in a retreat after a sharp rally in response to the Federal Reserve's press conference on Wednesday.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAlbermarle Stock Soars After Bullish Update on Lithium Outlook\n\nItaly's Leonardo says well-placed for surge in military spending\n\nNasdaq slumps 4% as bets of big rate hikes grow despite Fed view","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/albermarle-stock-soars-bullish-lithium-104121417.html","symbols":["ALB.US","AMC.F"],"tags":["ALBEMARLE STOCK","CONSENSUS FORECASTS","LITHIUM CARBONATE","LITHIUM HYDROXIDE"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.875,"neg":0.025,"neu":0.917,"pos":0.058}},{"date":"2022-05-05T01:37:00+00:00","title":"Rock Tech Lithium Announces Grant of Stock Options","content":"VANCOUVER, BC, May 4, 2022 \/PRNewswire\/ - Rock Tech Lithium Inc.

Russia is one of the world's biggest exporters of key raw materials, from crude oil and gas to wheat and aluminum, and the possible exclusion of supplies from the country due to sanctions has sent traders and importers into a frenzy.\n\nBase metals prices have been coming off recent highs (and in the case of aluminum, copper and tin, all-time highs) set earlier in the month that were spurred by fears over the potential for disruption to Russia\u2019s metal exports following its invasion of Ukraine. Broad-based supply concerns remain, ranging from the potential for sanctions targeting exports, to actual output disruption and logistical dislocations (see \u2018Implications of the Russia-Ukraine crisis for metals\u2019 for details).\n\nBut the Ukraine crisis is only layering onto another more powerful trend: the global transition to low-carbon energy.\n\nThe energy transition is driving the next commodity supercycle, with immense prospects for technology manufacturers, energy traders, and investors. Clean energy technologies require more metals than their fossil fuel-based counterparts, with prices of green metals projected to reach historical peaks for an unprecedented, sustained period in a net-zero emissions scenario.\n\nBut few, if any, green metals have witnessed a price explosion as epic as that of lithium.\n\nAfter more than quadrupling in value last year, lithium carbonate continues to soar in 2022 according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.\n\nThe rally in lithium hydroxide, used in high-nickel content cathode manufacture, is accelerating, up 120% so far this year, narrowing the discount to lithium carbonate, which historically is priced below hydroxide.\n\nBenchmark says that Chinese inventory levels for hydroxide, carbonate, and spodumene feedstock remain very low, sustaining the high price environment. Many investors who got burned by the last lithium price bust of 2018 have probably been watching on the sidelines, not sure what to make of the current mega-rally.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated: Norway Plans Record Gas Volumes For Europe\n\nTo be fair, China's spot market, where small tonnages can have big price impacts, may be accentuating the scale of this mega-rally, but make no mistake about it: this is no false flag, with everything from mined spodumene to high-purity hydroxide, and every component of the lithium processing chain experiencing a wild price surge. The price explosion tells you that lithium supply is simply nowhere near enough to feed this demand surge.\n\nWith earnings season here with us again,\u00a0 the famous lithium trio of Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM), FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) and Albermale (NYSE:ALB) will be heavily scrutinized. However, only SQM has really impressed with a 51.4% return so far this year, with FMC and ALB returning 9.9% and -12.7%, respectively, over the timeframe. The three companies are some of the largest in the business, with SQM boasting a $21.1B market cap, FMC is worth $16.7B while ALB is valued at $22.6B.\n\nLuckily, scores of lithium juniors have been responding more readily to the lithium price boom. Here are some that have been outstanding so far this year.\n\n#1. Lithium Energy Exploration Inc.\n\nMarket Cap: $14.7M\n\nYTD Returns: 328.6%\n\nHeadquartered in Toronto, Canada, Lithium Energi Exploration Inc. (OTCPK:LXENF)(TSXV:LEXI) engages in the acquisition, exploration, and development of lithium brine assets in Argentina. The company holds interests in the Laguna Caro project that includes eight mineral concessions covering approximately 17,759 hectares; the Antofalla North project that consists of thirteen mineral concessions covering approximately 41,496 hectares; and the Antofalla South project that includes eighteen mineral concessions covering 69,112 hectares in Argentina.\n\nIncorporated in 1998, Lithium Energi was formerly known as Portola Resources Inc. and changed its name to Lithium Energi Exploration Inc. in March 2017.\n\nBack in January, Lithium Energi Exploration announced that, under its JV Agreement with Global Oil Management Group, LLC (\"GOMG\"), implementation of exploration and development plans have been accelerating rapidly.\n\nLEXI reported that it\u2019s a\u00a0 20% non-dilutable stakeholder in the JV and that development is slated to commence immediately, with the Sorcia Group owning the exclusive license to utilize the International Battery Metals Ltd\u2019s (OTCPK:BATF) technology in Argentina and Chile. IBAT further stated that it has substantially completed the construction of its first lithium extraction unit and the system modules are currently being heat traced and insulated with final assembly and testing to take place in March in the U.S. prior to deployment to South America.\n\nRelated: Oil Prices Hit $110 As Europe Prepares To Ban Russian Crude\n\n#2. Sayona Mining Limited\n\nMarket Cap: $1.6B\n\nYTD Returns: 111.1%\n\nPaddington, Australia-based Sayona Mining Limited (OTCQB:SYAXF), together with its subsidiaries, engages in mineral exploration and development in Australia and Canada. The company explores for lithium, graphite, and gold deposits. Its flagship project is the Authier Lithium Project located in Quebec, Canada. The company also holds a 60% interest in the Moblan lithium project located in Northern Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nLast year, Sayona Mining reported that the Superior Court of Quebec approved its joint bid with Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) for the acquisition of North American Lithium, which owns a previously producing lithium project near Sayona's core Authier project.\n\nMore than $400M had been spent on the project, which was operational and ramping toward nameplate production in 2018 but then was placed on care and maintenance due to weak lithium markets and a shaky capital structure.\n\nSayona and Piedmont say they are proceeding with technical studies that would prepare for the integration of Sayona's Authier and Tansim projects with the facilities at NAL.\n\n#3. Frontier Lithium Inc.\n\nMarket Cap: $578.6M\n\nYTD Returns: 76.1%\n\nVal Caron, Canada-based Frontier Lithium Inc. (OTCQX:LITOF) engages in the acquisition, exploration, and development of mining properties in Canada. The company primarily holds a 100% interest in the PAK Lithium project, which covers 1,378 contiguous mining claim units totaling 26,774 hectares located in northwestern Ontario, Canada.\n\nFrontier has forged a strategic partnership agreement with XPS Expert Process Solutions to develop a process to refine spodumene concentrate into lithium hydroxide.

Reported GAAP net income was $53.2 million, 609% higher than the previous quarter, and 28 cents per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA was $53.3 million, 94% higher than the previous quarter, and adjusted earnings per share were 21 cents per diluted share. Further improvement in lithium market conditions and strong customer demand in the first quarter supported higher realized prices than anticipated at the beginning of the year.\n\n\"Strong lithium demand growth has continued in 2022,\" said Paul Graves, president and chief executive officer of Livent. \"Published lithium prices in all forms have increased rapidly amid very tight market conditions and Livent continues to achieve higher realized prices across its entire product portfolio.\"\n\nCapacity Expansion Update\n\nLivent remains on schedule to deliver all previously announced capacity expansions. The Company has also announced significant additional capacity expansions for both lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, as Livent continues to grow its production to meet future demand from its customers.\n\nLithium Carbonate\n\nIn its first expansion in Argentina, Livent is on track to add 10,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate capacity by the first quarter of 2023. Another 10,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate capacity is expected to be added in Argentina by the end of 2023, which will nearly double Livent's total available LCEs (1) from 2021 levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Company also announced last quarter that it began engineering work on a second capacity expansion in Argentina. Following completion of a preliminary analysis, this expansion is now expected to add an additional 30,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate capacity by the end of 2025, or 10,000 metric tons more than previously announced. By re-engineering the use of fresh water, the second expansion will not require access to any additional fresh water. It also allows Livent to improve overall lithium yields and reduce water use intensity for current and future operations.\n\nLivent has also begun evaluating a third expansion in Argentina that would add up to 30,000 metric tons of additional lithium carbonate capacity. This expansion would deploy a more conventional pond evaporation-based process and require significantly less capital versus prior expansions. Following the third expansion, Livent believes it can reach total capacity at its operations in Argentina of 100,000 metric tons by the end of 2030.\n\nLithium Hydroxide\n\nThe Company announces that it expects to add another 15,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide capacity at a new location in China by the end of 2023. Additionally, Livent is evaluating building a new facility in either North America or Europe that would process lithium material from battery recycling processes into lithium hydroxide. The Company is exploring multiple opportunities for partnership and funding and believes the new facility could be in operation by the end of 2025, with production capacity of at least 10,000 metric tons.\n\nLivent is also nearing completion of its 5,000 metric tons expansion of lithium hydroxide capacity in Bessemer City that will start commercial production in the second half of this year.\n\nFollowing these expansions, Livent expects to have total lithium hydroxide capacity of at least 55,000 metric tons by the end of 2025 (excluding Nemaska), more than double its existing hydroxide capacity of 25,000 metric tons.\n\nNemaska\n\nYesterday, Livent announced that it has agreed to double its ownership interest in Nemaska Lithium Inc. (\"Nemaska\") to 50% by issuing 17,500,000 shares of Livent common stock. Nemaska is a fully integrated lithium hydroxide development project with 34,000 metric tons of nameplate capacity located in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including, among other things, the expiration of certain notice periods required by applicable law. For more information regarding the transaction, please refer to the press release issued yesterday that can be found on livent.com.\n\nGuidance and Outlook (2)\n\nLivent has significantly increased its guidance for 2022 financial performance. With no projected change in volumes, this is driven by higher expected realized prices across all lithium products. For the full year, Livent now projects revenue to be in the range of $755 million to $835 million and Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $290 million to $350 million.\n\n($ million) Revised FY 2022 Guidance Prior FY 2022 Guidance Actual FY 2021 Revised YoY Growth (midpoint) Revenue 755 \u2013 835 540 \u2013 600 420 Up 89% Adj.

There are important factors that could cause Livent's actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Currently, one of the most significant factors is the continuing effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Additional factors that could cause Livent's actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements include a decline in the growth in demand for electric vehicles using high performance lithium compounds; increased supply chain disruptions in the electric vehicle manufacturing industry; volatility in the price for performance lithium compounds (as the principal driver of our higher guidance range is higher expected realized pricing); adverse global economic and weather conditions; competition; quarterly and annual fluctuations of our operating results; risks relating to Livent's planned production expansion and related capital expenditures, including any further suspension of our expansion efforts; the potential development and adoption of battery technologies that do not rely on performance lithium compounds as an input or that require a lesser amount of performance lithium compounds; liquidity and access to credit; the conditional conversion feature of the 2025 Notes; reduced customer demand, or delays in growth of customer demand, for higher performance lithium compounds; the success of Livent's research and development efforts; difficulty integrating future acquisitions; risks inherent in international operations and sales, including political, financial and operational risks specific to Argentina, China and other countries where Livent has active operations; the effects of war, such as the conflict in Ukraine; customer concentration and the delay or loss of, or significant reduction in orders from, large customers; failure to satisfy customer quality standards; increases in the price of energy and raw materials or broader global inflationary pressures; employee attraction and retention; union relations; cybersecurity breaches; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; not having established proven or probable mineral reserves, as defined by the SEC; legal and regulatory proceedings; including any shareholder lawsuits; compliance with environmental, health and safety laws; changes in tax laws; risks related to ownership of our common stock, including price fluctuations and lack of dividends; ESG risks, including events outside our control that could prevent us from achieving our sustainability goals; as well as the other factors described under the caption entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Livent's 2021 Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2022 and our subsequent Forms 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Although we provide a forecast for Adjusted EBITDA, we are not able to forecast the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Certain elements of the composition of the GAAP amount are not predictable, making it impractical for us to forecast such GAAP measure or to reconcile corresponding non-GAAP financial measure to such GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts. For the same reason, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Such elements include, but are not limited to, restructuring, transaction related charges, and related cash activity. As a result, no GAAP outlook is provided for these metrics.\n\nLIVENT CORPORATION CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited, in millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Revenue $ 143.5 $ 91.7 Costs of sales 83.6 78.4 Gross margin 59.9 13.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.8 10.7 Research and development expenses 0.9 0.7 Restructuring and other charges 1.0 0.3 Separation-related costs\/(income) 0.1 (0.1) Total costs and expenses 97.4 90.0 Income from operations before equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate, interest expense, net and other gain 46.1 1.7 Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate 2.2 1.3 Interest expense, net \u2014 0.3 Other gain (14.0) \u2014 Income from operations before income taxes 57.9 0.1 Income tax expense 4.7 0.9 Net income\/(loss) $ 53.2 $ (0.8) Net income\/(loss) per weighted average share - basic $ 0.33 $ (0.01) Net income\/(loss) per weighted average share - diluted $ 0.28 $ (0.01) Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic 161.7 146.5 Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted  191.4 146.5\n\nLIVENT CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME\/(LOSS) (GAAP) TO ADJUSTED EBITDA (NON-GAAP) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, (in Millions) 2022 2021 Net income\/(loss) $ 53.2 $ (0.8) Add back: Interest expense, net \u2014 0.3 Income tax expense 4.7 0.9 Depreciation and amortization 6.4 6.2 EBITDA (Non-GAAP) (1) 64.3 6.6 Add back: Argentina remeasurement losses (a) 1.0 2.3 Restructuring and other charges (b) 1.0 0.3 Separation-related costs\/(income) (c) 0.1 (0.1) COVID-19 related costs (d) 0.8 0.9 Other loss (e) 1.6 1.1 Subtract: Blue Chip Swap gain (f) (14.0) \u2014 Argentina interest income (g) (1.5) \u2014 Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) (1) $ 53.3 $ 11.1\n\n__________________ 1. We evaluate operating performance using certain Non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, which we define as net income\/(loss) plus interest expense, net, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization; and Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as EBITDA adjusted for restructuring and other charges, separation-related costs\/(income) and certain other losses\/(gains). Management believes the use of these Non-GAAP measures allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of its underlying business from period to period. The Non-GAAP information provided may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies because of differing methods used by other companies in calculating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. This measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income\/(loss) or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Represents impact of currency fluctuations on tax assets and liabilities and long-term monetary assets associated with our capital expansion as well as foreign currency devaluations. The remeasurement losses are included within \"Cost of sales\" in our condensed consolidated statement of operations but are excluded from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because of: i.) their nature as income tax related; ii.) their association with long-term capital projects which will not be operational until future periods; or iii.) the severity of the devaluations and their immediate impact on our operations in the country. b.

Adjusted after-tax earnings excludes the effects of special charges and tax-related adjustments. The Company also believes that excluding the effects of these items from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of its underlying business from period to period.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, $2.9 million and $2.6 million of the interest on the 2025 Notes was capitalized, respectively. i.  The Company excludes the GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from the Non-GAAP measure of income, and instead includes a Non-GAAP tax provision based upon the projected annual Non-GAAP effective tax rate. The GAAP tax provision includes certain discrete tax items including, but not limited to: income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to operating results in the current year; tax adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency remeasurement of certain foreign operations; certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years; certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets and related interim accounting impacts; and, changes in tax law. Management believes excluding these discrete tax items assists investors and securities analysts in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to operating results thereby providing investors with useful supplemental information about the Company's operational performance. The income tax expense\/(benefit) on special charges\/(income) is determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which the special charge or income occurred and includes both current and deferred income tax expense\/(benefit) based on the nature of the Non-GAAP performance measure.\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in Millions) 2022 2021 Non-GAAP tax adjustments: Income tax expense\/(benefit) on restructuring, separation-related and other corporate costs $ 0.1 $ (0.5) Foreign currency remeasurement and other discrete items (3.9) (1.1) Blue Chip Swap gain 1.4 \u2014 Other discrete items  0.2 1.3 Total Non-GAAP tax adjustments $ (2.2) $ (0.3)\n\nRECONCILIATION OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES (GAAP) TO ADJUSTED CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS (NON-GAAP) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, (in Millions) 2022 2021 Cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 10.8 $ 12.7 Restructuring and other charges 0.2 0.2 Separation-related costs\/(income) 0.4 (0.7) COVID-19 related costs (a) 0.8 0.9 Adjusted cash provided by operations (Non-GAAP) (1) $ 12.2 $ 13.1\n\n___________________ 1.

(\"Nemaska\"), a fully integrated lithium hydroxide development project located in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. Livent will issue 17,500,000 shares of its common stock to The Pallinghurst Group (\"Pallinghurst\") and its investors to acquire their half of Qu\u00e9bec Lithium Partners (\"QLP\"). Livent already owns the other half of QLP. Following the close of the transaction, QLP will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Livent, and Livent will in turn own 50% of Nemaska through QLP. Investissement Qu\u00e9bec (\"IQ\") will remain the owner of the remaining 50% interest in Nemaska. Livent Corporation (PRNewsfoto\/Livent Corporation)\n\n\"Livent is committed to the success of the Nemaska lithium project and increasing its ownership reflects this commitment,\" said Paul Graves, president and chief executive officer of Livent. \"We believe that Nemaska, as a large and low-cost integrated lithium hydroxide project, will be an important part of the supply of sustainable critical battery materials. Nemaska will further strengthen Livent's global footprint and is strategically located to serve growing lithium demand in North America and Europe. We will continue to work closely alongside the Government of Qu\u00e9bec to ensure that Nemaska becomes a leading supplier of battery-grade hydroxide. The progress of Nemaska to its current advanced stage of engineering would not have been possible without the critical contributions of Pallinghurst and we look forward to continuing to work with them on further development of Nemaska, as a major investor in Livent.\"\n\nLivent will continue to have responsibilities with Nemaska in the development and future production and commercialization of the project. Further information regarding its investment will be provided during Livent's upcoming earnings call on May 3rd, 2022.\n\n\"Nemaska has made significant progress with its strategic plans under QLP's leadership. We will merge our interests in an all-share transaction and our investors are excited to continue to be exposed to Nemaska as long-term shareholders in Livent,\" said Arne H. Frandsen and Andrew Willis, Co-Founders and Managing Partners of Pallinghurst. \"We are committed to the success of Nemaska through our investment in Livent, as part of the development of Pallinghurst's broader battery materials presence in Qu\u00e9bec.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the past eighteen months, the Nemaska team and its shareholders have invested significant resources in securing the future of Nemaska, including progressing an optimization study focused on improving and enhancing the entire value chain from mine to battery grade materials. In doing so, it has ensured a strong focus on sustainability and a zero-carbon footprint through the use of green hydroelectric power and the implementation of strong ESG principles. The conclusion of this optimization study and a final construction decision are expected by the end of the third quarter of this year. Nemaska is expected to be a fully integrated asset with 34,000 metric tons of nameplate capacity of battery-grade lithium hydroxide with first production in 2025.\n\nThe transaction will fully settle all financial obligations of Livent towards Pallinghurst. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including, among other things, the expiration of certain notice periods required by applicable law.\n\nAbout Livent For nearly eight decades, Livent has partnered with its customers to safely and sustainably use lithium to power the world.

(NASDAQ: AQMS) (\"Aqua Metals\" or the \"Company\"), which is reinventing metals recycling with its AquaRefining\u2122 technology, today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2022.\n\nSteve Cotton, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \u201cDuring the first quarter of 2022, we commenced Aqualyzer equipment shipments to ACME Metals\u2019, the world\u2019s first deployment of third generation (version 1.5) AquaRefining operation. These shipments, both from the U.S. and from in-country equipment suppliers the Company has established in Taiwan, will support the previously announced plan to install and commission the AquaRefining facility in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe continue to build on our positive forward momentum with lithium-ion battery recycling, and we have made noteworthy progress in moving our economical and environmentally advantageous lithium-ion battery (LiB) recycling process from concept to execution to meet the exponential growth in global demand for lithium-ion battery recycling and supply chain needs. In February, we announced that we had achieved a key milestone and potentially an important industry breakthrough by producing our first lithium hydroxide from lithium-ion battery black mass at the Company\u2019s Innovation Center in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center. This is significant because currently the only commercially proven recycling technology being utilized for lithium-ion batteries is smelting, which does not recover the lithium. In March, we announced that we had achieved another key accomplishment in metals recycling by recovering copper from lithium-ion battery black mass at the Company\u2019s Innovation Center. This week, we announced the production of high purity nickel from lithium-ion battery black mass and demonstrated that nickel sulfate can be easily produced from the nickel metal source. The Company is excited with the results of our R&D efforts. Later this year, we plan to install and commission our pilot-scale system and expand our production later next year. We have already secured our black mass feedstock needs to complete our initial pilot and pre-demonstration testing through the end of 2023.\n\nOur business model today is capital light, focusing on providing equipment and licensing our technologies in an enabler model that allows us to work with anyone in the industry globally and address the entire marketplace. We are also exploring joint ventures and potentially operating our own lithium-ion battery recycling facilities in the future, particularly as our Li AquaRefining matures through 2022 and into 2023.\u201d\n\n2022 Q1 Financial Results\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, Aqua Metals focused on research and development activities to enhance its ability to recycle metals found in lithium-ion batteries and commenced shipping equipment to ACME Metals\u2019 facility. The Company was not in commercial production during 2022 and, as a result, generated no revenue during the quarter.\n\nCost of product sales decreased by approximately 38% during the year to $0.9 million compared to $1.6 million in Q1 2022. The cost of product sales decreased during Q1 2022 due to wrapping up the plant clean-up project.\n\nResearch and development costs included expenditures related to improving the Lithium-ion battery AquaRefining technology. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, research and development increased overall for the quarter by approximately 91% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021. Research and development is a crucial part of our business strategy and includes our focus on continuous product improvement of the Company's proprietary technology for LAB recycling and further advancing our development related to the application of AquaRefining to recycling lithium-ion batteries.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased approximately 20% for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021. Increases in general and administrative expenses included changes in stock-based compensation and an increase in professional fees.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2022, the Company had an operating loss of $4.3 million, compared to an operating loss of $4.2 million for the first quarter of 2021. The net loss for the first quarter of 2022 was $4.4 million, or $0.06 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $4.1 million, or $0.06 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2021.\n\nThe Company utilized its at-the-market share sales agreement during the quarter. Through opportunistic share sales, Aqua Metals raised additional net proceeds of approximately $3.9 million during the first quarter.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, the Company exercised the warrant for all 500 LINICO Series A Preferred shares. The 2,000 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock represent approximately 12% of LINICO common stock on a fully diluted basis.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, the Company sold $0.8 million of equipment classified as assets held for sale.\n\nAs of March 31, 2022, the Company had $9 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nConference Call and Webcast\n\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss those results and corporate developments at 4:30 p.m. (EDT), the same day. Investors can access the live call by dialing (877)-407-9708 toll free or (201)-689-8259 for international callers.

If you want to skip reading about how and why lithium prices are skyrocketing, you can go directly to 5 Best Lithium Stock To Buy Now.\n\nLithium prices are rallying during the EV boom. As concerns about climate change and global warming alarm governments to take action, and the global economy transitions to electrified transport and abandons combustion engines, the demand for lithium is bound to skyrocket. The biggest industrial application of lithium as of now is its use in powertrains of electric vehicles. Every big player in the automobile manufacturing industry has announced its plans to go all-electric at some point in the future, with some targeting achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2035, and others planning all-electric fleets by 2050. Lithium manufacturers and miners are looking at lucrative days ahead, as the demand for lithium grows catalyzed by global EV adoption.\n\nGlobal EV Adoption\n\nAccording to Statista, even though a semiconductor shortage resulted in a rough year for the automobile industry in 2021, global electric vehicle sales saw a two-fold increase compared to 2020, peaking at 6.6 million up from 3 million. According to the EV volumes data, cited by the International Energy Agency, all net growth in global car sales in 2021 can be attributed to EVs. China was leading in 2021 having almost tripled electric car sales from 1.2 to 3.4 million. Europe was the runner-up region that reported new car registrations up by 70% from 2020, hitting 2.3 million, roughly half of which had electric powertrains. For the first time in history, new car sales crossed 1 million in the United States, and more than half of which were electric cars.\n\nStrong Demand For Lithium Ahead\n\nAccording to S&P Global Commodity Insights, the demand for lithium is expected to further strengthen in 2022. S&P Global Platts data shows that seaborne lithium carbonate prices went up by 413% in 2021 and hit $32,600 per metric ton last December. Lithium hydroxide prices gained 254% over the same period to reach $31,900 per metric ton. Lithium chemical supply is expected to hit 636,000 metric tons, up from roughly 497,000 metric tons in 2021. The demand for lithium is forecasted to grow to 641,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2022, up from 504,000 metric tons in 2021. This creates a deficit of 5,000 metric tons, down from a deficit of 8,000 metric tons in 2021, and according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, this deficit is expected to drive lithium prices to record highs in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoaring lithium prices have resulted in EV manufacturers pondering about creating their own lithium power plants. This April, a tweet highlighted the exponential growth of the price of lithium from $4,450 per tonne in 2012 to $78,032 per tonne as of April 2022. Shortly after, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), was reported to be talking about exploring opportunities for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to get into mining and refining lithium on its own unless prices for the commodity relax.\n\nProminent names in the lithium industry include Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS), and Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo determine the 10 best lithium stocks to buy now we looked for companies that are continually making progress with expansions of their facilities and are racing to become the go-to suppliers for major EV companies.

(NASDAQ: AQMS) (\"Aqua Metals\" or the \"Company\"), a leading innovator in metals recycling with its AquaRefining\u2122 technology, has achieved an additional milestone in proving its recycling technology by plating high purity nickel metal, one atom at a time, from black mass created from a variety of lithium-ion batteries. This achievement supports the expectation that Aqua Metals\u2019 Li AquaRefining potentially has strong economic and environmental advantages over other lithium-ion recycling processes in use or under development. High purity nickel enables a streamlined process for producing lithium battery-grade material. Aqua Metals\u2019 early test production of nickel sulfate, a compound often used in battery precursor material, showed promising results.\n\n\u201cThe only Li-battery recycling method commercially in use today is smelting, which produces an alloy of the metals that needs multiple pyrometallurgical steps of processing to achieve the product we produce right out of our system,\u201d said David Regan, Vice President of Commercial for Aqua Metals. \u201cThese additional steps add emissions and cost, which is why we believe our process may be more cost-effective and sustainable than smelting or other recycling methods, and even mining.\u201d\n\nNickel is a key component in lithium-ion batteries as it can pack a lot of energy per battery while allowing battery producers to reduce the use of cobalt, which is more expensive. According to Stockhead, nickel demand for lithium-ion batteries could grow by 567% by 2025, compared to 2019 levels. The exponential growth in demand for nickel due to the global expansion of EVs has resulted in a correlating and unprecedented surge in nickel prices. The nickel market was already exceptionally tight due to supply concerns in Indonesia, the top producer of nickel, but this was greatly exacerbated by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022, as Russia is one of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of the metal. Russia\u2019s invasion and subsequent sanctions resulted in nickel prices hitting record-breaking levels in March, increasing as much as 60% in one day, one of the most extreme moves ever seen on the metal markets. Today nickel trades at more than $32,000 per ton, up more than 100% over the past year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAqua Metals believes its Li AquaRefining process has the lowest environmental footprint of any technology under development. It recycles spent lithium-ion batteries in a clean, economical way that is fundamentally non-polluting by utilizing the renewable electron as the reagent instead of chemicals or high heat. Aqua Metals believes that AquaRefining has the potential to be a superior solution to solely mining for critical metals, and one of the most effective ways of achieving President Biden\u2019s Presidential Invocation of Defense Production Act for Battery Materials national security goal to secure a domestic supply chain for critical and strategic battery metals through environmentally and socially responsible means.\n\n\u201cIt is an environmental and geopolitical reality that the United States needs to transition to electrified transportation supported with renewable energy while also building a strong domestic battery supply chain through environmentally responsible recycling,\u201d commented Steve Cotton, Aqua Metals\u2019 President and CEO. \u201cOur sustainable recycling process has already proven its ability to extract high-quality lithium, copper, and now nickel from lithium-ion black mass, and we intend to build on these early successes to help deliver on the President\u2019s vision of a robust and environmentally responsible domestic industrial base to meet the requirements of the clean energy economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeyond the potential economic and environmental advantages of AquaRefining, we feel our ability to produce high purity metals can be a big differentiator for us,\u201d said Ben Taecker, Chief Operations and Engineering Officer of Aqua Metals. \u201cPlating such a high-quality nickel enables us to go directly to the production of battery precursor material without having to implement any additional refining steps. This streamlines the process, adding economic and environmental value. Our production of high purity nickel sulfate from the nickel we plated supports this. We remain on track for implementing a fully operational pilot later this year.\u201d\n\nTo date, the Company has also produced high-purity lithium hydroxide and copper from lithium-ion battery black mass at the Company\u2019s Innovation Center in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center. Through the development of AquaRefining for lead batteries, Aqua Metals is the only company that has experience building a commercial clean metals recycling technology. Aqua Metals will continue to update the market as meaningful progress is made.\n\nFigure 1 is available at https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/baa5786e-d8c7-4d17-9a48-7925f9640566\n\nFigure 2 is available at https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/d5a7e111-d15e-4cff-a170-aaa2b58d1abd\n\nConference Call\n\nThe Company will be hosting its first quarter 2022 results conference call today, April 28th at 4:30 p.m. (EDT), during which time management will discuss these recent nickel results as well as other corporate developments.\n\nInvestors can access the live call by dialing (877)-407-9708 toll free or (201)-689-8259 for international callers.

Targets 10 and 11 correspond with the locations of the B-1 and B-2 Beryl Pegmatites on Jean Lake and Targets 5, 6, and 7 are on trend with the SG and GRP on Snow Lake Lithium's ground. On March 10th, 2022, Snow Lake Lithium announced results from exploration hole GRP-001, an exploration hole previously undrilled, returned 2 pegmatite intercepts grading 30% spodumene from 34.8 m to 40.48 m, and 41.86 m to 44.22 m for a total intersection of 8.04 m[1]. It is noteworthy that Snow Lake Lithium's GRP structure appears to directly connect to one of the imaged magnetic low features present on Jean Lake. We have prioritized the top 10 drill targets for an immediate drill program based upon all available data.\"\n\nScott Taylor, President and CEO of Foremost Lithium states: \"The final magnetic data interpretation, together with the 3.89% Li2O assayed on the B-1 Beryl pegmatite outcrop and the 5.17% Li2O on the B-2 Beryl pegmatite outcrop, and the March 10th disclosure of Snow Lake Lithium's interim drilling results hitting intercepts of 30% spodumene on GRP-001 have imparted a sense of urgency and enthusiasm to extend and expedite our exploration work and drilling campaign throughout the spring and summer on Jean Lake.\"\n\nScott Taylor continues: \"In recent news, Canada's mining sector is set to receive an unprecedented tranche of Federal incentives to accelerate and scale up production of raw materials used in EV batteries[2]. One example is the new Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (CMETC) which specifically incentivizes capital deployed to support hard rock Canadian lithium exploration and development activities. Stellantis and LG Energy Solution recently announced a new $4.9 Billion-dollar Ontario based Gigafactory scheduled to come online in 2024. American automakers General Motors & Ford Motor Co. have both announced plans to make electric vehicles at Ontario based factories. These long-term macroeconomic catalysts all support the Company's strategic focus and enhance the value of our Snow Lake lithium assets which are situated nearby these massive long-term Canadian EV investments.\"\n\nTechnical information contained in the press release has been approved by the Company's Co-Founder and Geoscience Advisor, Lindsay Bottomer, P.

(TSXV: FL) (FRA: HL2) (OTCQX: LITOF) (the \"Company\" or \"Frontier\") is pleased to announce that it has successfully completed a mineral processing pilot plant campaign that will provide 500 kg of spodumene concentrate to be used for lithium hydrometallurgical conversion process piloting.\n\nDr. Naizhen Cao, Vice President of Technology for Frontier Lithium, commented \" The piloting program has generated data required to support the company's advancing feasibility studies. The pilot also produced representative concentrates required for lithium chemicals processing for battery-grade lithium hydroxide production.\" He further added, \"We are satisfied with the campaign results from the representative sample as they compare favourably to lithium industry specifications. We see the opportunity to improve lithium grade, recovery, and reduce iron content by further optimizing conditions and the flowsheet.\"\n\nA representative sample of 7,800 kg was assembled that contained a blend of ore from the Spark (89%) and PAK (11%) deposits. The sample contained mafic minerals representing internal and external dilution at an overall content of 4%.\n\nThe assay of the sample processed by the pilot plant is summarized in Table 1, which included 1.57% Li2O and 0.80% Fe2O3. The lithium content is reasonably similar to the average resource grade that would be 1.47% based on the proportions of PAK ore at 2.00% Li2O and Spark ore of 1.40% Li2O that was recently updated according to the March 1st press release.\n\nLi2O SiO2 Al2O3 Fe2O3 MgO CaO Na2O K2O P2O5 MnO 1.57 72.8 16.3 0.80 0.31 0.61 3.66 2.34 0.24 0.11\n\nDue to the fine grained nature of the spodumene mineralization in the Spark deposit, processing of the ore using Dense Media Separation (DMS) is not beneficial and processing involved flotation with conventional preparatory steps of desliming, magnetic separation, and gravity concentration.\n\nThe pilot plant campaign involved a total operating time of 81 hours that included a continuous run of 31.5 hours. In total, 930 kg of concentrate was produced with an average grade of 6.0% Li2O. The grade of concentrate produced on a per shift basis ranged from 6.4% to 5.6% Li2O and a bulk sample of 640 kg was prepared at a grade of 6.13% Li2O and 0.76% Fe2O3 was prepared. A 500 kg portion of this material was sent to the Company's technology development partner for hydrometallurgical conversion process piloting.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe survey collected during the final operating shift, FPP-08, produced a similar concentrate as the bulk sample at 6.07% Li2O and achieved a lithium recovery of 76%. This compares well with the recovery achieved from the bench-scale locked cycle test announced on January 11, 2022 of 78%. The assays and lithium recovery of the total representative concentrate of this campaign are listed in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: The assays and lithium recovery of the total representative concentrate produced in this campaign (%)\n\nLi2O SiO2 Al2O3 K2O Na2O CaO P2O5 MgO MnO Fe2O3 Li Recovery 6.07 64.80 24.20 0.25 0.62 0.96 0.36 0.36 0.12 0.78 76\n\nThe magnetic separation equipment used during the pilot plant appears to have not been effective and further magnetic separation testing on a subsample concentrate produced from the pilot plant reduced the iron levels to 0.27% Fe2O3 and it is expected that this can be attained in a future operation.\n\nIn 2020, Frontier successfully produced a high quality technical-grade spodumene concentrate with an average grade of 7.2% lithium oxide with low impurities including iron oxide levels below 0.15% Fe2O3 and total yield greater than 25% from a PAK Deposit composite sample.\n\nDue Diligence\n\nAll scientific and technical information in this release has been reviewed and approved by Garth Drever , P.Geo., the qualified person (QP) under the definitions established by National Instrument 43-101. Figure 1 Grinding Circuit (CNW Group\/Frontier Lithium Inc.)\n\nAbout Frontier Lithium\n\nFrontier Lithium is a preproduction business that is targeting to become a manufacturer of battery-quality lithium materials to support electric vehicle and battery supply chains in North America. Frontier owns the PAK Lithium Project which contains one of North America's highest-grade, large-tonnage hard-rock lithium resources in the form of a rare low-iron spodumene. The project continues to have significant exploration upside with potential to increase the lithium resource. The Company is a pure-play lithium development opportunity with the largest land position in a premium lithium mineral district located in Northern Ontario.\n\nAbout the PAK Lithium Project\n\nThe PAK Lithium Project contains a tier one lithium resource size in North America and is one of the global top three premium resources by quality. A 2021 preliminary economic assessment (National Instrument 43-101 technical report titled \"Pak Property\" by BBA E&C Inc., issued on April 5, 2021) delivered a fully integrated lithium operation from the resource to achieve downstream conversion plan for production of battery-quality lithium salts. The study resulted in an after-tax net present value (discounted at 8 per cent) of $974-million (U.S.) with a 21-per-cent internal rate of return. The Project encompasses 26,774 hectares at the south end of Ontario's Electric Avenue, the largest land package hosting premium lithium-bearing pegmatites in Ontario. The Project is supported by a measured and indicated resource of 21.64 million tonnes (Mt) averaging 1.56 per cent lithium oxide (Li2O) and inferred resource of 20.87 Mt averaging 1.42 per cent Li2O.The Project covers 65 kilometres of the Electric Avenue's length and remains largely unexplored; however, since 2013, the company has delineated two premium spodumene-bearing lithium deposits (PAK and Spark), located 2.3 kilometres apart. Considerable exploration upside is supported on the Project through two other spodumene-bearing discoveries: the Bolt pegmatite (located between the PAK and Spark deposits), as well as the Pennock pegmatite (30 kilometres northwest of PAK Deposit within the project claims).\n\nForward-looking statements\n\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.

Invests U$839 million in Lithium business in Argentina","content":"- Started construction of a 25,000-ton lithium plant based at Salar del Hombre Muerto\u2026 Completion by 2024\n\n- Construction of an additional 25,000-ton plant is scheduled to begin within this year... Expand to 100,000 tons by 2028\n\nSEOUL, South Korea, March 23, 2022 \/PRNewswire\/ -- POSCO Holdings started construction of a plant to commercialize brine lithium in Argentina. The POSCO Group is Argentina's first to produce lithium hydroxide for batteries through the entire process, from acquisition of mining rights to exploration to construction and operation of a production plant. POSCO Group's Brine Lithium Demo Plant in Argentina\n\nOn the 23rd, at the groundbreaking ceremony in Salta Province, Argentina for the brine lithium plant based at Salar del Hombre Muerto (Salt Lake), located at an altitude of 4,000 meters. Those in attendance included POSCO Group CEO, Jeong-woo Choi, POSCO Holdings Eco-friendly Future Materials Team Leader Byeong-og, Yoo, POSCO Argentina Head Kwang-bok Kim, Governor of Salta Province Gustavo Saenz , and Governor of Catamarca Province Raul Jalil, South Korean Ambassador to Argentina Myung- soo, Jang.\n\nCEO Choi's participation in the groundbreaking ceremony is the first step globally since the inauguration of POSCO Group holding company on the 2nd and the first on-site visit to the lithium facility, one of the group's 7 core businesses.\n\nThe brine lithium plant is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024 with an annual production capacity of 25,000 tons of lithium hydroxide. The total investment is about 839 million dollars (about 1 trillion KRW), including infrastructure investment and working capital. The construction and operation of the lithium plant and financing will be carried out by POSCO Argentina, a wholly-owned subsidiary of POSCO Holdings.\n\nIn addition to the lithium business, POSCO Group plans to increase the mass production to 50,000 tons from the end of 2024 through a second investment of 25,000 tons per year and expand the production to a maximum of 100,000 tons from the same lake by 2028.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 25,000 tons of lithium hydroxide that POSCO Group will produce annually with the start of operations are sufficient to supply about 600,000 electric vehicles. When production is expanded to a maximum of 100,000 tons, this volume can fulfill demand for about 2.4 million electric vehicles.\n\nWith the recent increase in global demand for electric vehicles, battery companies around the world are striving to secure lithium and POSCO Group has preemptively secured a large amount of lithium, a key material for batteries, thereby remarkably strengthening the competitiveness of POSCO Chemical's cathode material business. The battery material business has gained a clear upper hand in the world. Since cathode materials are mainly made of lithium, nickel, and manganese, securing adequate supplies of these raw materials leads to competitiveness in the cathode material business.\n\nThe POSCO Group preemptively took over Argentine salt lakes in 2018 in response to the prospect of a global lithium supply shortage due to the full-fledged electric vehicle era. Montgomery & Associates, a global brine lithium consulting company, confirmed at the end of 2020, that the lithium reserves, based on lithium carbonate in the salt lake, are 13.5 million tons, which is six times the 2.2 million tons estimated at the time of the acquisition.\n\nConsidering the mining possibility and yield, it is expected that at least 2.8 million tons of lithium carbonate will be produced. Because the lithium concentration in this salt lake recorded an average of 921 mg\/L, indicating that it has the highest lithium content among all of Argentina's salt lakes, and coupled with the lake's low concentration of impurities like magnesium, it is projected to have the world's highest yield.\n\nIn addition, by applying POSCO Group's independently developed lithium extraction technology, the company has secured global competitiveness in terms of productivity by dramatically shortening production time and improving yield. The currently skyrocketing price of lithium has reached five times the price when the lake was acquired (market price of $70,000 per ton of lithium). Considering the normal operating profit margin of 50% in the lithium mining industry, the lake is forecast to produce ten trillion won in accumulated operating profit.\n\nPOSCO Group plans to become one of the top 3 global companies in lithium production by 2030 based on the brine, hard rock, and recycling of waste batteries at the group level including POSCO Argentina, POSCO Lithium Solution, and POSCO HY Clean Metal, centered on the parent company, POSCO Holdings. On the 14th, POSCO JK Solid Solution, a joint venture with Jeong Kwan Co., Ltd., began using its solid electrolyte production technology on the first solid electrolyte production line. The process uses lithium in expanding the battery material business to the next generation of solid state batteries.\n\nOn the 21st, CEO Jung-woo Choi met with President Alberto \u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez, Minister of Industry of Argentina in the Federal Government Matias Kulfas, and Deputy Minister of Mining Fernanda Avila at the Presidential Palace in Buenos Aires where they discussed cooperation between the POSCO Group and the government of Argentina in the battery material business. The POSCO Group and Argentine government signed an MOU for enhanced business cooperation in the projected lithium plant expansion and etc.\n\nAlso on this day, CEO Jeong-woo Choi requested cooperation in the hydrogen and food sectors as well as the battery material business, and President Fernandez promised active cooperation.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"estimate,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"can,\" \"shall,\" \"should,\" \"would,\" \"leading,\" \" objective,\" \"intend,\" \"contemplate,\" \"design,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"plan,\" \"target\" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual events or results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, risks related to: risks related to whether the Company will close the Public Offering on the expected terms, or at all; the anticipated use of the net proceeds of the Public Offering; the fact that the Company\u2019s management will have broad discretion in the use of the proceeds from any sale of the shares; the risk that anticipated plans, development, production, revenues or costs are not attained; the Company\u2019s operations being further disrupted and the Company\u2019s financial results being adversely affected by public health threats, including the novel coronavirus pandemic; the Company\u2019s limited operating history in the lithium industry; the Company\u2019s status as a development stage company, including the Company\u2019s ability to identify lithium mineralization and achieve commercial lithium mining; mining, exploration and mine construction, if warranted, on the Company\u2019s properties, including timing and uncertainties related to acquiring and maintaining mining, exploration, environmental and other licenses, permits, access rights or approvals in Gaston County, North Carolina, the Province of Quebec, Canada and Cape Coast, Ghana as well as properties that Piedmont may acquire or obtain an equity interest in the future; completing required permitting activities required to commence processing operations for the LHP-2 Project; the Company\u2019s ability to achieve and maintain profitability and to develop positive cash flows from the Company\u2019s processing activities; the Company\u2019s estimates of mineral reserves and resources and whether mineral resources will ever be developed into mineral reserves; investment risk and operational costs associated with the Company\u2019s exploration activities; the Company\u2019s ability to develop and achieve production on the Company\u2019s properties; the Company\u2019s ability to enter into and deliver products under supply agreements; the pace of adoption and cost of developing electric transportation and storage technologies dependent upon lithium batteries; the Company\u2019s ability to access capital and the financial markets; recruiting, training and developing employees; possible defects in title of the Company\u2019s properties; compliance with government regulations; environmental liabilities and reclamation costs; estimates of and volatility in lithium prices or demand for lithium; the Company\u2019s common stock price and trading volume volatility; the development of an active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock; the Company\u2019s failure to successfully execute its growth strategy, including any delays in the Company\u2019s planned future growth; and other factors set forth in the Company\u2019s most recent Transition Report on Form 10-KT and subsequent reports, as filed with the SEC.\n\nAll forward-looking statements reflect Piedmont\u2019s beliefs and assumptions based on information available at the time the assumption was made. These forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but rather on management\u2019s expectations regarding future activities, results of operations, performance, future capital and other expenditures, including the amount, nature and sources of funding thereof, competitive advantages, business prospects and opportunities. By its nature, forward-looking information involves numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, known and unknown, that contribute to the possibility that the predictions, forecasts, projections or other forward-looking statements will not occur. Although Piedmont has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, believed, estimated, or expected. Piedmont cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Except as otherwise required by the securities laws of the United States, Piedmont disclaims any obligation to subsequently revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. Piedmont qualifies all the forward-looking statements contained in this release by the foregoing cautionary statements.\n\nAbout Piedmont Lithium\n\nPiedmont Lithium is developing a world-class, multi-asset, integrated lithium business focused on enabling the transition to a net zero world and the creation of a clean energy economy in North America.
