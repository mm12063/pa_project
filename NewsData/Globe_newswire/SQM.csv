"2019-03-04T15:30:00+00:00","New Lithium Supply - From Pilot Plants to Commercialization; Companies Ramping up for Global Demand of the Future","POINT ROBERTS, Wash. and DELTA, British Columbia, March  04, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Investorideas.com, an investor news source covering lithium stocks, issues a snapshot looking at key trends including growing demand due to EV growth, new extraction technology and strong financials from industry leaders, creating renewed investor optimism.\n\nLithium has been in high discussion following the strong financials recently reported by lithium giant Albemarle Corporation, setting the stage for a bullish mindset for the lithium sector.\n\nSociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE: SQM) also recently reported their Q4 Earnings call in which Ricardo Ramos, Chief Executive Officer of SQM commented on the company’s 2018 year and the state of lithium moving into 2019.\n\n“Our high-grade sales volume in ESPN, high-grade iodine and high grade average price of lithium contributed to our 2018 results. The Lithium market is surrounded, as you know, by positive news. Full electric vehicle penetration level reached approximately 2%, and these rates are expected to grow probably in the future. Demand growth in 2018 surprised us again, surpassing 27%, and it's expected to grow rates above 20% in 2019,” said Ramos.\n\nAs the lithium leaders pave the way for bullish sentiment in the sector, incumbent new sources of lithium are being developed by a select few players in the space advancing lithium brine projects.\n\nE3 METALS CORP. (TSXV: ETMC) (OTC: EEMMF), a lithium development company with a property containing 6.7 Mt LCE inferred mineral resource in Alberta, announced a major milestone in the development of its proprietary extraction process, a key to their future positioning in the market.\n\nSince its inception in 2017, E3 Metals has quadrupled its permit size, put out a maiden resource and subsequently tripled it, developed proprietary Ion Exchange Lithium Extraction Technology and advanced its lithium process closer to commercialization.\n\nThe Company is close to piloting its technology which converts oilfield brine into pure high-grade feedstock to be transformed into valuable lithium products, with optionality for hydroxide or carbonate.\n\nSummarized from the news: E3 has enhanced performance of its proprietary Ion Exchange Lithium Extraction Technology, achieving higher lithium concentrations of up to 5367 mg/L lithium, compared to the previous level of 1498 mg/L. Average recovery was over 90%, confirming very high efficiency and greater than 99% impurity removal.\n\nE3 Metals’ CEO Chris Doornbos stated, “This increase in concentration using our proprietary Extraction Technology is the key to unlocking the value of our vast, yet lower grade, resource. These results move us a significant step toward supporting E3’s goal of becoming an industry leading, low-cost producer of battery grade lithium products. We have demonstrated the ability to significantly increase our lithium concentration without using additional energy. The higher concentration means less volume to handle downstream from our lithium Extraction Technology and should reduce the energy, inputs and potentially the capital and operating costs required to generate lithium hydroxide. These results continually demonstrate an innovative and robust process developed by the University of Alberta supported by Green Centre Canada, with funding from Alberta Innovates.”\n\nNeo Lithium Corp. (TSXV: NLC) (OTCQX: NTTHF) says it aims to be known as a “prominent new name in lithium brine exploration by virtue of its high quality 3Q Project and experienced team.”\n\nThe Company recently announced that the lithium carbonate pilot plant built by the Instituto de Investigaciones Tecnologicas from Universidad de Concepcion, Chile has successfully arrived in Fiambala, Catamarca, Argentina. The Company’s engineers have started reassembling the Plant and expect to have it fully operational in late February for its Tres Quebradas lithium brine project in Catamarca Province, Argentina.\n\nThe Plant was previously successfully tested with synthetic brine in Chile and is going to start using brine from the 3Q Project, concentrated approximately to 4% lithium from 3Q Project pilot evaporation ponds to start pilot scale production of lithium carbonate at the Plant. Currently the designed annual capacity of the pilot ponds is over 500 tonnes of approximate 4% lithium brine per year, and the Plant has a designed capacity of 50 tonnes of lithium carbonate per year.\n\nLithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC), advancing its Cauchari-Olaroz lithium brine project in Jujuy, Argentina and Thacker Pass lithium claystone project in Nevada, USA to production just reported temporary disruptions in Argentina due to heavy rainfall.\n\nAlso included in the update; “Following the release of the Preliminary Feasibility Study in August 2018, through development of a pilot plant in Reno, Nevada, the Company is considering the production of lithium hydroxide directly from lithium sulphate to provide added flexibility. Commissioning of the pilot plant is underway, with testing and optimization expected to commence in the near term.”\n\nFrom pilot plants to full production, the lithium sector is ramping up for long term global demand. Incumbent lithium brine companies will be able to compete if they can keep their costs down and advance their extraction technologies, readying themselves for the EV highways of the future.\n\nInvestor Ideas directory of lithium stocks: mining stocks directory and cleantech stock directories, relating to batteries.\n\nAbout Investorideas.com \r\nhttps://www.investorideas.com/About/\n\nSocial Media \r\nTwitter https://twitter.com/Investorideas\r\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/Investorideas\r\nYouTube https://www.youtube.com/c/Investorideas\n\nDisclaimer/Disclosure: Our site does not make recommendations for purchases or sale of stocks, services or products.

"2016-03-28T18:18:00+00:00","Lithium Americas and SQM Announce Joint Venture","VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - March 28, 2016) -Lithium Americas Corp. (""Lithium Americas"", or ""LAC"") (TSX:WLC)(OTCQX: WLCDF) (formerly Western Lithium USA Corporation) is pleased to announce a definitive agreement with Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (""SQM"") (NYSE:SQM)(SSE:SQM.B)(SSE:SQM.A) to enter into a 50/50 joint venture (the ""Joint Venture"") on the Cauchari-Olaroz lithium project in Jujuy, Argentina (the ""Joint Venture Transaction"").\n\nThe Joint Venture will go into effect following a capital contribution of US$25 million by SQM in exchange for a 50% ownership stake in Minera Exar S.A. (""Minera Exar""), a wholly owned subsidiary of LAC. SQM's contribution includes US$15 million to repay intercompany loans between Minera Exar and LAC; the remaining US$10 million will be allocated to project development. SQM and LAC intend to immediately advance a work and engineering plan, which contemplates completion of an updated definitive feasibility study based on an existing study for Cauchari that was completed by Minera Exar in 2012. The updated study will evaluate economic feasibility for a project with a nameplate production capacity of approximately 40,000 metric tons per year of lithium carbonate equivalent. Depending on the results of the study, the project may be executed in stages.\n\nTom Hodgson, Chief Executive Officer of LAC, commented, ""SQM is the world leader in lithium production with decades of development and operating experience and a strong team of technical and commercial talent. It also has a track record of success as a partner in many global joint ventures. One of the principal objectives of the Joint Venture is to leverage the technical experience of SQM to materially de-risk the development of Cauchari-Olaroz and to successfully advance the project to bring new supply to the market on a timely basis. Lithium plays an important strategic role in the energy revolution and it is critical that our industry respond by delivering more supply to meet increasing demand.""\n\nPatricio de Solminihac, Chief Executive Officer of SQM, commented, ""SQM is committed to the lithium business, both in Chile and abroad. The Salar de Caucharí is a great complement to our existing lithium operations in Chile, and it is located just a few hundred kilometers from the Salar de Atacama. We expect to have similar production processes at both sites, and as a result we should benefit from operating synergies.""\n\nMr. de Solminihac continued, ""We are confident that this joint venture will generate value for our shareholders. We believe that SQM's years of experience in the lithium business, and our vast distribution network, combined with LAC's knowledge of the Salar de Caucharí and its stakeholders, will prove to be key advantages that will contribute to the success of this project.""\n\nRecognizing that over the past seven years well over US$1 billion has been invested globally in lithium development projects which has resulted to date in minimal increase in lithium supply, Lithium Americas has been evaluating options to ensure Cauchari-Olaroz is brought into production in a timely manner with the lowest possible development risk. Lithium Americas has considered proposals from potential partners from various parts of the world, and from leading companies representing different parts of the lithium battery supply chain. Lithium Americas has evaluated traditional and new processing technologies, and has also examined the possibility of developing Cauchari-Olaroz on a stand-alone or independent basis.\n\nJohn Kanellitsas, Vice Chairman of Lithium Americas, commented, ""Lithium Americas' board has determined that SQM represents the premier partner in the world for our project. Their understanding of brine chemistries, pond and chemical plant construction, knowledge of all end-user product specifications and the collaborative approach with our team were important criteria in our selection process. We believe that SQM is the world's largest and lowest cost producer of lithium from brines and our board has determined that a joint venture with SQM in which we pursue a production path utilizing a proven, low-cost brine evaporation process represents the optimal course to maximize long term value for Lithium Americas' shareholders.""\n\nCauchari-Olaroz is believed to be the world's 3rd largest lithium brine resource and is fully permitted for immediate construction and development. The project benefits from excellent infrastructure including a nearby natural gas pipeline, a paved international highway with direct access to Salar de Atacama and a deep sea port, fresh water on site, and strong support from local communities and the government of Jujuy province. Since its inception in 2009, Lithium Americas has invested over CDN$80 million in a resource exploration and project development program which includes resource definition, advanced modeling, approximately 10,000 meters of drilling, testing and pumping wells and 43-101 technical studies, including a definitive Feasibility Study (""dFS"") completed in 2012. The 2012 dFS was based on a production capacity of 20,000 TPA lithium carbonate and resulted in a post-tax NPV of US$464M with average annual net cash flows of US$117M, and was based on forecasted LCE average prices of approximately US$5,900, well below current world prices. The Joint Venture is targeting a production capacity of approximately 40,000 TPA lithium equivalent in its upcoming development plan investigations.\n\nFranco Mignacco, President of Minera Exar, commented, ""We are very pleased to welcome our neighbor SQM as our partner to advance the project in Jujuy Province of Argentina, which is fully permitted and ready for construction. As stewards of one of the world's great lithium brine resources at the Cauchari salar, we are delighted to enter into this commercial partnership with SQM, who will be investing both its capital and its talent. The Joint Venture also demonstrates success for all stakeholders and local communities from the policies of the new Argentine government in its desire to attract foreign investment.""\n\nInformation of a scientific and technical nature in this news release in respect of the Cauchari-Olaroz Lithium Project has been approved by Roger Kelley (Chem.
