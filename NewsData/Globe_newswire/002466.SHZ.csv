Tianqi Lithium had marketed the shares at HK$69 to HK$82 each.\n\nA representative for Tianqi Lithium didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe share sale breaks a months-long drought for large offerings in Hong Kong, where funds raised between January and June fell more 90% from the previous year. The city has been hit even harder by the global slump than other trading hubs, as central banks move to combat surging inflation and spikes in volatility have put issuers on the sidelines.\n\nAs virus-related curbs in China ease and the country’s equities recover both at home and abroad, a successful listing by Tianqi Lithium could open the window for a pickup in Hong Kong offerings. China Tourism Group Duty Free Corp., which is traded in Shanghai, is set to relaunch a Hong Kong listing that could raise around $2 billion to $3 billion as soon as in the third quarter.\n\nTracing its history to the construction of its first lithium carbonate plant in 1992, Tianqi Lithium mines lithium in Australia and produces lithium compounds and derivatives in China, a prospectus shows.

"2022-07-03T00:00:00+00:00","Hong Kong’s Dry Spell for IPOs Set to End With Big China Deals","(Bloomberg) -- After a dismal first six months, things are finally looking up for initial public offerings in Hong Kong as several large Chinese firms line up to list in Asia’s financial hub in the second half.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJPMorgan Sees ‘Stratospheric’ $380 Oil on Worst-Case Russian Cut US Court Ruling May Take 70,000 Truckers Off Road, Spur Jams Crypto Meltdown Claims Rolex and Patek Philippe as Victims The Wheels Have Come Off Electric Vehicles Netflix Crashes After ‘Stranger Things 4’ Finale Release\n\nBattery materials producer Tianqi Lithium Corp. just opened its books for what is set to be the city’s first billion-dollar deal this year while China Tourism Group Duty Free Corp. may relaunch an offering of around $2 billion.\n\nAlong with several other mid- to large-sized deals in the pipeline, they are poised to revive a dormant market where firms raised a paltry $2.6 billion between January and June. That’s a 92% slump from last year and the lowest sum for the same period since 2009.\n\nThe pick up in upcoming listings speaks of an improving environment for valuations as the easing of virus-related curbs and Beijing’s dialing back on a corporate crackdown spur a world-beating rally in stocks in China and Hong Kong. Better clarity on rules for Chinese share offerings abroad could also “encourage more new listings” in Hong Kong, Charles Zhou, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a note last month.\n\nThe flow of positive news from China has propelled the benchmark CSI 300 Index toward a technical bull market and analysts are expecting more constructive policy reinforcements in the second half of the year.\n\n“If it happens, that would hopefully help to push through some of our pipeline of equity deals that are waiting for a better market window to open,” said Selina Cheung, co-head of Asia equity capital markets at UBS AG in Hong Kong.\n\nIn the first half, Hong Kong saw only one IPO that was larger than $500 million. That was back in January plus the majority of companies that have debuted this year are trading below water. Notably, IPO activity has dried up globally as investors fret over inflation, hawkish central banks and recession fears.\n\nStory continues\n\nWindow of Opportunity\n\nHong Kong’s dry spell now looks set to end with a flurry of small-size deals coming through late in June as issuers hurried to take advantage of a short window favoring Chinese equities.\n\nTianqi Lithium’s potential $1.7 billion listing paves the way for July to be the strongest month for IPOs in Asian financial hub this year. The pipeline of offerings of about $500 million or more also includes snack maker Weilong Delicious Global Holdings Ltd. and Wego Blood Purification, the dialysis unit of China’s Wego Group. China’s Imeik Technology Development Co., which has a market cap of $19 billion, has also filed for a listing on the HKEX.\n\nMore regulatory clarity from Beijing for firms planning to sell their shares overseas will also be key going forward.\n\nRead a QuickTake on China’s Overseas IPOs\n\nMany of the potential listings are already trading in New York but are trying to tap investors closer to home due to fears of being kicked out stateside due to the regulatory impasse with the US.\n\nSuch is the case for consumer goods retailer Miniso Group Holding Ltd., which is seeking up to $116 million. Others have opted to go public in Asia by way of introduction, a mechanism that doesn’t involve selling new shares.\n\nA number of companies have “continuously” worked on their listing plans as they wait for a market window to reach ideal valuations, said Shi Qi, head of ECM at China International Capital Corp. “Looking ahead, companies related to stable growth policies and social wellbeing could see better opportunities in the market,” she said, citing themes like carbon neutrality, environmental governance, new energy, consumption and healthcare.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Lottery Lawyer Won Their Trust, Then Lost Their Mega Millions Did Razzlekhan and Dutch Pull Off History’s Biggest Crypto Heist?

""Leading players have better opportunities to chase the rapid growth in the coming decade.""\n\nThe board's confidence was bolstered by Tianqi's shares, which jumped by 580 per cent to a record 136.25 yuan on August 31, helped by the overwhelming demand in the booming electric car industry.\n\nThe company swung to a first-half profit of 86 million yuan, compared to an interim loss of 697 million yuan a year ago. Still, it is saddled with borrowings, with a debt-to-asset ratio of 88 per cent at the end of June, according to its interim report.\n\nWhile Tianqi is looking to expand, so is CATL, whose customers include BYD and Tesla.

"2020-12-14T10:13:05+00:00","Tianqi Lithium Corporation -- Moody's: Tianqi Lithium's proposed sale of interest in subsidiary is credit positive, no immediate ratings impact","Announcement: Moody's: Tianqi Lithium's proposed sale of interest in subsidiary is credit positive, no immediate ratings impact\n\nGlobal Credit Research - 14 Dec 2020\n\nHong Kong, December 14, 2020 -- Moody's Investors Service says that Tianqi Lithium Corporation's (Caa2 negative) proposed financing from the sale of interest in its subsidiary to IGO Limited and its term loan amendment plan are credit positive because their completion will likely improve Tianqi Lithium's capital structure and liquidity.\n\nHowever, these two announcements have no immediate impact on its ratings, because of the significant uncertainties relating to the various conditions and concerns that need to be resolved before the completion of the proposed financing and loan amendment plans.\n\nTianqi Lithium disclosed in an announcement dated 9 December that Australian mining company IGO Limited had agreed to acquire a 49% stake in its subsidiary, Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia Pty Ltd (TLEA), by subscribing to new shares issued by TLEA for a consideration of USD1.4 billion.\n\nTianqi Lithium will use USD1.2 billion of the proceeds to repay its borrowings, while the remainder will go towards financing operations at TLEA.\n\nTianqi Lithium also disclosed in another announcement dated 9 December that the company had received from its banks a term sheet stating that the maturity for its USD1.9 billion loan, originally due on 29 November 2020 and extended to 28 December 2020, could be rescheduled to November 2021. If the company repays at least USD1.2 billion of this loan, the remaining maturity could be further moved to November 2022.\n\nThe company is currently negotiating with its banks to finalize the loan amendment plan before 28 December 2020.\n\nAs disclosed in Tianqi Lithium's announcement dated 9 December, the absence of alternative plans and a failure to complete the loan amendment plan before 28 December 2020 could lead to payment acceleration and result in litigation and/or an asset freeze that could negatively impact its operations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe proposed financing and the loan amendment plans are subject to a number of conditions and factors, such as approvals from relevant government and regulatory authorities.\n\nMoody's estimates that, if both plans are completed, the proceeds from IGO's investment could help to reduce Tianqi Lithium's adjusted debt level by about 22% over the next 12-18 months and improve the company's debt maturity profile in light of the ongoing loan amendment discussion. Together, these two developments could improve Tianqi Lithium's capital structure and liquidity.\n\nUnder its proposed financing plan with IGO, while Tianqi Lithium's effective stake in its Greenbushes lithium mine in Australia will decline to 26% from 51%, the company will continue to consolidate TLEA and Greenbushes, given that it will hold a 51% stake in TLEA, which in turn holds a 51% stake in Greenbushes.\n\nTianqi Lithium's rating primarily reflects uncertainties relating to its loan amendment plan which, if not completed within a reasonable period of time, could lower recovery prospects for creditors, given its highly strained capital structure.\n\nThe company's rating also considers the company's solid position in the lithium chemical industry, driven by its supply of low-cost lithium minerals, although these strengths have been offset by its weak capital structure.\n\nThe negative outlook reflects Moody's concerns over Tianqi Lithium's tight liquidity and ability to arrange timely funding to meet its obligations.\n\nMoody's will continue to closely monitor the progress and timing of the company's plans.\n\nThe principal methodology used in these ratings was Chemical Industry published in March 2019 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1152388. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.\n\nHeadquartered in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, Tianqi Lithium Corporation is a leading lithium chemicals producer that mines, makes and sells lithium minerals and lithium chemicals.\n\nThe company owns a 51% stake in the Greenbushes lithium mine in Western Australia. It also owns a 25.9% stake in Chilean chemical producer, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (Baa1 negative).\n\nThis publication does not announce a credit rating action.

"2020-12-08T10:15:10+00:00","Tianqi Lithium Corporation -- Moody's downgrades Tianqi Lithium to Caa2 following default","Rating Action: Moody's downgrades Tianqi Lithium to Caa2 following default\n\nGlobal Credit Research - 03 Dec 2020\n\nHong Kong, December 03, 2020 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded to Caa2 from Caa1 Tianqi Lithium Corporation's corporate family rating (CFR), and to Caa3 from Caa2 the senior unsecured rating on the bonds issued by Tianqi Finco Co., Ltd and guaranteed by Tianqi Lithium.\n\nThe ratings outlook remains negative.\n\nIn an announcement dated 1 December, Tianqi Lithium stated that it had on 30 November signed a loan extension agreement with its banks for a USD1.9 billion term loan facility due 29 November, extending the maturity to the earlier of 28 December 2020 or the effective date of an amended loan agreement.\n\nThis event constitutes a missed payment default under Moody's definition as Tianqi Lithium failed to meet its original payment promise and was granted a maturity extension.\n\n""The downgrade reflects our concern that the absence of a satisfactory resolution on the term loan restructuring could lower recovery prospects for creditors,"" says Gerwin Ho, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Credit Officer. ""The current situation could also lead to an acceleration of payments relating to the company's other obligations and impact its operations.""\n\nRATINGS RATIONALE\n\nTianqi Lithium's rating primarily reflects its highly strained capital structure as a result of its sizeable debt burden, elevated leverage, weak liquidity and weak financial management.\n\nHowever, the rating considers the company's solid position in the lithium chemical industry and good profitability, which are driven by its supply of low-cost lithium minerals; although these strengths have been offset by its weak capital structure.\n\nThe company's rating is also constrained by its product concentration in lithium minerals and lithium chemicals, with limited revenue scale, and exposure to regulatory risks.\n\nStory continues\n\nTianqi Lithium's leverage has increased significantly following its acquisition of a 23.8% stake in Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM, Baa1 negative) in December 2018, which brought its total stake in the company to 25.9%.\n\nMoody's expects Tianqi Lithium's financial leverage -- as measured by total debt to EBITDA and with SQM accounted for on an equity method basis -- will remain elevated above 10x over the next 12 months, given Moody's expectation of flat EBITDA and continued high debt. Such high leverage renders the company's capital structure untenable.\n\nThe company's flat EBITDA is attributable to muted lithium chemical prices that continue to reflect Moody's expectation of supply growth that could hinder cash flow generation and delay deleveraging.\n\nTianqi Lithium's liquidity remains weak. At 30 September 2020, the company's cash reserves -- including restricted cash -- of RMB1.3 billion were insufficient to cover its short-term debt of RMB16 billion, including the USD1.9 billion loan maturity that was due on 29 November.\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) issues are material to the ratings and were assessed as follows.\n\nThe company benefits from global trends to reduce carbon emissions, because lithium is a core input into the manufacture of electric vehicles. At the same time, its mining and chemical production operations are exposed to environmental and safety risks. Nonetheless, Moody's is not aware of any major environmental or safety incidents.\n\nMoody's regards the coronavirus outbreak as a social risk under its ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety. Today's action also reflects the impact on Tianqi Lithium of the breadth and severity of the shock, and the broad deterioration in credit quality the event has contributed to.\n\nFrom a governance perspective, Tianqi Lithium's ownership is concentrated and only a minority of its board consists of independent directors. Moreover, the company's debt-funded acquisition of a 23.8% stake in SQM and inability to arrange refinancing to meet its obligations reflect weak financial management and an aggressive financial policy.\n\nFACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS\n\nThe negative outlook reflects Moody's concerns over the company's tight liquidity and ability to arrange timely funding to meet its obligations.\n\nAn upgrade is unlikely in the near term, given the negative outlook. A positive rating action could be considered if the company makes significant progress on servicing its debt obligations and improves its liquidity and capital structure, such as a satisfactory restructuring of its term loan facility.\n\nMoody's could downgrade the ratings if principal losses for Tianqi Lithium's debt holders are likely to increase.\n\nThe principal methodology used in these ratings was Chemical Industry published in March 2019 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1152388. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.\n\nHeadquartered in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, Tianqi Lithium Corporation is a leading lithium chemicals producer that mines, makes and sells lithium minerals and lithium chemicals.\n\nThe company owns a 51% stake in the Greenbushes lithium mine in Western Australia. It also owns a 25.9% stake in Chilean chemical producer, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A.\n\nREGULATORY DISCLOSURES\n\nFor further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity to Assumptions in the disclosure form.

"2020-10-12T01:12:30+00:00","The Best Way to Avoid a $1.9 Billion Default? Just Let Go","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Sometimes, letting go is the hardest thing to do. China’s most ambitious companies have yet to learn that lesson.\n\nThe corporate sector has gone on a global shopping spree in recent years, buying expensive assets by raising new debt. Now, struggling to repay their loans, some are unwilling to part with their purchases, even as they walk to the brink of bankruptcy. The end result can only be untimely defaults.\n\nConsider Tianqi Lithium Corp., China’s largest lithium carbonate producer and a key supplier to the buzzing electric vehicle industry. It may default on a $1.88 billion loan due late November, the company warned recently.\n\nTianqi’s woes began in 2018 when it made a highly leveraged acquisition of a 23.77% stake in Chilean lithium miner Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile SA. Of the $4.1 billion Tianqi paid, a whopping $3.5 billion was borrowed money, syndicated by China Citic Bank Corp. As of late September, the company was already behind on 464 million yuan ($69 million) of interest payments on loans for the deal.\n\nAn obvious solution to meet its deadline would be to divest the SQM stake, a non-core asset. Granted, the company would be selling at a substantial loss. It bought at $65 a share, and SQM is now trading at roughly half the price, as lithium compound prices have tumbled since the purchase. Nonetheless, an outright sale would be enough to repay the syndicated lenders in November.\n\nTianqi seems unwilling to bite the bullet. Instead it's looking for roundabout ways to dig itself out. The company is searching for strategic investors; and its parent Chengdu Tianqi Industry Group Co., which has a one-third stake, has pledged out most of its shares to support Tianqi’s finances. These margin loans are risky: More than half are due within six months.\n\nAs Tianqi dithers, it’s paying a hefty price. Margin calls aside, the company is missing the stock market’s euphoria for Tesla Inc.’s suppliers. Until just a few months ago, Tianqi’s shares closely tracked those of its largest competitor, Ganfeng Lithium Co. Now, its imminent debt crisis is creating a divergence. While Ganfeng is up 63% this year, Tianqi has lost over 30% of its market value, or about $2 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven as it struggles to service debt, fashion conglomerate Shandong Ruyi Technology Group Co. — best known for its ambition to become China’s LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE — is also unwilling to part with its prized purchases. Its $300 million dollar bond due in July 2022 now has an ask yield of 20%.\n\nAlready, Ruyi’s ability to retain control over its overseas assets is slipping. In May, Renown Inc., the century-old Japanese apparel maker the company bought into as early as 2010, filed for bankruptcy. Then in August, Ruyi brushed aside a sale of spandex maker Lycra Co. It got control of the company in a $2.6 billion deal last year; now it’s looking to take the long and uncertain route to an initial public offering.\n\nWas that wise? Lycra’s business prospects are only dimming as the pandemic drags on. In the second quarter, its adjusted Ebitda fell 86% from a year earlier, Debtwire reported last month. Ruyi had taken out a $400 million senior mezzanine loan, pledged with its Lycra shares, to fund the acquisition. Those lenders could seize Ruyi’s stake if the company proves too stubborn. It has already missed loan payments.\n\nOf course, the temptation is to wait and let the valuations of these crown-jewel assets recover. With SQM, lithium prices seem to have stabilized. Lycra could bounce back, too: People will need to refresh their yoga wear once a Covid-19 vaccine enables us to go to the gym again.\n\nBut for distressed companies like Tianqi and Ruyi, time is not on their side. Goldin Financial Holdings Ltd., controlled by mainland billionaire Pan Sutong, provides a cautionary tale. Pursued by creditors, the distressed developer agreed to sell its 28-story Hong Kong headquarters at a discount to its appraisal value in July.\n\nA second temptation is to use these prized assets to haggle for state bailouts. China Inc. has something strategic that Beijing wants, and the government should pay a premium, the thinking goes.\n\nDon’t let yourself go down that path. In the coronavirus age, there are too many damsels in distress and not enough white knights to go around. Many state-owned affiliates are already waiting in line for bailouts, and the government has no money this year.\n\nThe reality is, Beijing no longer believes in too big to fail. In August, the central bank decided to liquidate Baoshang Bank Co., its first bank seizure in decades. Earlier this year, Peking University Founder Group Corp., a high-profile commercial arm of the prestigious university, went into bankruptcy court.\n\nThis is the new trend in China. Companies will go into bankruptcy, and assets will get seized and sold, just like everywhere else in the world.

"2020-05-26T14:05:37+00:00","Lithium producers must wait as pandemic slows electric vehicle revolution","By Helen Reid and Ernest Scheyder\n\nJOHANNESBURG/HOUSTON, May 26 (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has paused the electric vehicle revolution, forcing producers of battery metal lithium into survival mode with output cuts, expansion delays and sales of major assets.\n\nLithium industry shares have dropped sharply since January as the economic downturn from the pandemic slammed the brakes yet again on the electrification revolution that for years has seemed just around the corner. Investors are giving the cold shoulder to mine developers seeking funding for lithium projects.\n\n""This pandemic further kicks the EV can down the road,"" said Seth Goldstein, a lithium industry analyst with Morningstar.\n\nThe holdup will result in a shortage of the white metal available for EV batteries when markets rebound, warned industry analysts, executives and consultants.\n\n""We don't want to spend a great deal on lithium at the moment,"" said Vincent Mascolo, chief executive of Ironridge Resources Ltd, which has put its Ghana lithium project up for sale. ""Investor appetite is not there.""\n\nThis year began with expectations that global demand for the white metal would jump 15%, according to Morningstar. The advisory group now expects a 5% drop in demand in 2020.\n\nAlbemarle Corp has slowed expansion projects in Chile and Australia. Tianqi Lithium Corp, saddled by debt, is selling its controlling stake in the world's largest lithium mine. SQM said it may shelve lithium expansion plans for the year.\n\nAnalysts point to Ganfeng Lithium Co's move this year to take control of an Argentina lithium project from smaller, indebted miner Lithium Americas Corp as the type of opportunistic deals likely during the pandemic.\n\nLithium executives, investors and analysts expect the downturn to roil their industry for at least a year. Some warned it could crimp operations through the middle of the decade depending on how COVID-19 affects EV deployment plans from Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and other automakers.\n\nStory continues\n\nConventional wisdom holds that low oil prices should encourage consumers to buy internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Still, electric vehicle sales should ultimately rise as environmental concerns have prompted EV subsidies and regulations in China and the European Union.\n\n""If you make EVs the only vehicles available on the lot, consumer buying patterns change very fast,"" said Devin Lindsay, an automotive analyst at IHS Markit Ltd.\n\nAnd because China and the EU are the world's biggest EV producers, their regulations are seen as ultimately forcing greater EV adoption in the United States, where fuel prices might usually influence car buying.\n\n""For good or bad, this EV thematic is driven by regulations and government incentives, rather than economics,"" Paul Graves, chief executive of lithium producers Livent Corp, told Reuters.\n\nEVs are expected to become the most-popular vehicles, globally, though the pandemic makes the timing uncertain.\n\n""The long-term story is a structural trend toward EV adoption. It's very well on its way,"" said Pedro Palandrani of the Global X Lithium & Battery Technology ETF.\n\n(Reporting by Helen Reid and Ernest Scheyder; Editing by David Gregorio)","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lithium-producers-must-wait-pandemic-140537463.html?.tsrc=rss","002460.SHE","002466.SHE","ALB.US","F.US","GNENF.US","LAC.US","VLKAF.US","VLKPF.US","VWAGY.US","VWAPY.US","","","","","","","","ALBEMARLE CORP","EXPANSION PROJECTS","LITHIUM INDUSTRY","LITHIUM PRODUCERS","","","","","","","","0.777","0.054","0.889","0.057"
