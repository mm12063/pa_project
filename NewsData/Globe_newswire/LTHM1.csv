Livent Corporation (PRNewsfoto/Livent Corporation)\n\nPaul Graves, president and chief executive officer of Livent, commented, ""We believe lithium will continue to play an important role in decarbonization and the shift to electrification. With urgency building for climate change solutions, our 2021 Sustainability Report underscores the critical need for the lithium industry to responsibly meet the growing demand for lithium.""\n\nMr. Graves continued: ""Sustainability is and will continue to be a top priority for Livent as we approach key implementation milestones in our current capacity expansion projects and advance our recently announced expansions. In parallel with driving our growth initiatives, our teams are working hard to take the necessary steps to achieve our 2030 and 2040 ESG goals.

"2022-07-04T10:15:06+00:00","When Should You Buy Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM)?","Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM), is not the largest company out there, but it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$34.49 and falling to the lows of US$20.66. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Livent's current trading price of US$22.17 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Livent’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Livent\n\nIs Livent still cheap?\n\nLivent appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 72.74x is currently well-above the industry average of 15.21x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Livent’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nCan we expect growth from Livent? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Livent's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat this means for you:\n\nAre you a shareholder? LTHM’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe LTHM should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on LTHM for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for LTHM, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nKeep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. Be aware that Livent is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis and 1 of those is a bit concerning...\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Livent, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

This move was narrower than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.88%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.82%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.08%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the supplier of performance lithium compounds had lost 16.37% over the past month.

"2022-06-27T11:45:33+00:00","7 Top Lithium Stocks for the Second Half of 2022","Goldman Sachs just made lithium stocks even more attractive.\n\nJust days ago, the firm said that lithium prices could fall about 10% this year, and as much as 73% next year. But they’re wrong.  For one, as noted by Bloomberg, “Benchmark disputes Goldman’s forecast that a flood of new production is on its way, and that prices will crater as a result.” Benchmark also says the lithium market will remain short until 2025.\n\nMoreover, Bloomberg also noted that “Matt Fernley, the London-based managing director at Battery Materials Review, an industry researcher, said the sell side reports are ‘massively over-estimating’ the ease of adding new supply, and failing to consider the complexity of bringing new assets into production and the qualification requirements.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeanwhile, Time Magazine contributor Emily Barone added that “[w]hile the Earth has plenty of lithium to go around, the supply needs to be extracted from brine pools and underground reserves, and current mining operations aren’t sufficient to keep up with the auto industry’s growing needs.”\n\nSo, if you believe lithium prices are coming down soon, I have a bridge to sell you. With significant demand and little supply, prices won’t come down soon. I’m honestly not sure what Goldman Sachs was thinking. But we should thank the firm for making lithium stocks even more attractive than before.\n\n7 Retirement Stocks to Buy in Unexpected Sectors\n\nTherefore, let’s take a closer look at seven lithium stocks for investors to consider right now.\n\nTicker Company Price LAC Lithium Americas $21.82 SLI Standard Lithium $4.71 LTHM Livent Corp. $24.25 LIT Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF $75.80 BATT Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF $15.36 ALB Albemarle Corp. $224.79 PLL Piedmont Lithium $41.64\n\nLithium Stocks: Lithium Americas (LAC) Mobile phone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the past month, Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) stock has fallen more than 13% to just under $22 per share, where it’s now oversold.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, from current prices, I’d like to see it rally back to about $32 in the long term. Helping the cause is the fact that at its Thacker Pass mine, results of a Feasibility Study on the first phase of Thacker Pass now expects an an increased initial capacity of 40,000 tpa of lithium carbonate. This is up from the previously expected figure of at least 30,000-35,000 tpa of lithium carbonate.\n\nAlso, in April, Deutsche Bank analyst Corinne Blanchar raised the firm’s price target to $40 from $34, with a “Buy” rating. She believes lithium producers are well positioned with pricing improving. And with all of this combined, LAC stock looks like one of the top lithium stocks to consider.\n\nStandard Lithium (SLI) Graphic of Lithium scientific symbol (Li) in the shape of a big white gear with construction equipment and mountain around it\n\nSource: GrAl / Shutterstock.com\n\nSince the beginning of June, Standard Lithium (NYSEAMERICAN:SLI) slipped from just above $6 to now sitting at $4.71 per share. That said, from current prices, I’d like to see the stock retest $5.50 in the near term.\n\nAt the moment, Standard Lithium is working on a 3.14 tonne LCE Indicated Resource, a 150,000-acre joint venture Lanxess Project in Arkansas. “The region is home to North America’s largest brine production fairway with over five decades of commercial production, significant infrastructure, abundant low-cost electricity, access to chemical reagents and water sources. The project is already permitted for extensive brine extraction and processing activities,” the company said.\n\nFurthermore, in the past seven month, three analsysts have reiterated “Buy” ratings on SLI stock. In terms of price targets, the trio of analysts’ estimates range from a low of 13 CAD per share and 14.28 CAD per share.\n\nShould You Buy Apple Stock? Two Key Issues to Consider\n\nThus, investors should pay closer attention to SLI stock moving forward.\n\nLithium Stocks: Livent Corp. (LTHM) Livent Corporation logo on a phone screen. LTHM stock.\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nAnother solid lithium stock to consider is Livent Corp. (NYSE:LTHM), a pure play lithium producer. After dropping from about $34.61 at the end of May to a low of $21.71, LTHM stock became oversold. That said, from current prices, I’d like to see the stock retest at least $31 per share in the near term.\n\nRight now, the company has 16 offices or manufacturing facilities across the world — including its “largest and most diverse manufacturing facility” in North Carolina. It will also soon start phase two of its carbonate expansion in Argentina, with commercial production expected to begin by 2023.\n\nFurthermore, earnings are impressive, too. For the first quarter of 2022, company revenues were up 17% quarter-over-quarter (QOQ) to $143.5 million. Year-over-year (YOY), revenue was up 56%. Also, GAAP net income was 609% higher quarter over quarter at $53.2 million.\n\nIn other words, this is a strong company in a growing industry. And that could mean good things for investors looking for lithium stocks to buy.\n\nGlobal X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) a pile of lithium\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.com\n\nOne of my favorite ways to trade any hot sector is with an ETF, such as the Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:LIT).\n\nNot only does this ETF offer great diversification, but it also does so at a lower cost. At $75.62 per share, and with an expense ratio of 0.75%, the LIT ETF offers exposure to stocks, such as Albemarle (NYSE:ALB), BYD Co. (OTC:BYDDY), LG Chem (OTC:LGCLF), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Livent Corp., Lithium Americas Corp., Quantumscape Corp. (NYSE:QS) and Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) to name a few.\n\n7 Red-Hot Growth Stocks That Will Outrun a Recession\n\nAfter slipping from about $80 back in early April to its current levels, I’d like to see the LIT ETF eventually retest $79 in the near term. At a lower price now, though, investors could take advantage.\n\nLithium Stocks: Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT) a lithium ion battery\n\nSource: Olivier Le Moal/ShutterStock.com\n\nAnother solid ETF to consider is the AmplifyAdvanced Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:BATT).\n\nAt $15.33, with an expense ratio of 0.59%, BATT offers exposure to companies involved in battery storage, battery metals and materials and EVs. Some of its top holdings include Tesla, Glencore PLC (OTCMKTS:GLNCY), Nio Inc. (NYSE:NIO), Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) and LG Chem to name a few.\n\nSince early June, the ETF slipped from about $16 per share to $14.19 per share. From here, I’d like to eventually see the BATT ETF retest a $18 high from early April.\n\nAlbemarle Corp. (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle, the 800 lb. gorilla in the lithium space, has been beaten silly. Since topping out around $273, ALB stock dropped to a low of $198. Now, it’s technically oversold and may be overdue for a pivot higher. And from current prices, I’d like to see ALB retest $270 shortly.\n\nIn May, the company boosted its guidance for the second time for the full year. It now expects 2022 sales to come in between $5.8 billion and $6.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to come in between $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion. And adjusted earnings per share (EPS) is expected to fall in between a range of $12.30 and $15.\n\n“Over the past 12 months, we’ve made significant progress in renegotiating more variable-priced contracts with our lithium customers. Implementation of these contracts is a key driver of the expected year-over-year improvement in our financial results,” CEO Kent Masters said. “We now expect full-year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be up more than 160% from prior year based on favorable market dynamics for our Lithium and Bromine businesses.”\n\n7 Stock Bargains Worth a Look After the Most Recent Pullback\n\nOverall, this is a great sign for Albemarle. And thus, is a good sign for ALB stock investors, as well as potential investors of lithium stocks.\n\nLithium Stocks: Piedmont Lithium (PLL) a lithium mine\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPiedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) fell from a high of about $67.50 to $47.50, where it’s starting to pivot higher. From current prices, I’d like to see the PLL stock rally back to $67.50. Helping, the company’s partner Sayona Mining recently posted positive study results for a North American lithium mine restart. According to a company press release, the study estimates annual production of about 168,000 tonnes per year of 6% spodumene concentrate over a 27 year period.\n\nAlso, in late May, Cowen analyst David Deckelbaum initiated coverage of the PLL stock with an “Outperfom” rating, with a $90 price target.\n\nAccording to the analyst, “Piedmont is underappreciated for its near-term spodumene projects in Quebec and Ghana, which give it price advantaged feedstock towards a vertically integrated lithium hydroxide conversion strategy, while its flagship Carolina Lithium project adds further upside beyond 2025,” as quoted by TheFly.com.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\n$200 Oil Sooner Than You Think – Buy This Now The Best $1 Investment You Can Make Today Early Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air” It doesn’t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

"2022-06-23T12:46:12+00:00","Implied Volatility Surging for Livent (LTHM) Stock Options","Investors in Livent Corporation LTHM need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Aug 19, 2022 $12.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Livent shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Livent is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Chemical - Specialty industry that ranks in the Top 28% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 16 cents per share to 30 cents in that period.\r\n\r\nGiven the way analysts feel about Livent right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Click to skip ahead and see why Anna Nikolayevsky Is Selling Off Roblox and These 4 Stocks.\n\nRoblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Unity Software Inc.

She also worked as an analyst at Goldman Sachs. Nikolayevsky attained a BS from NYU and an MBA from Columbia University. Anna Nikolayevsky Is Selling Off Roblox and These 9 Stocks\n\nAnna Nikolayevsky of Axel Capital\n\nThe overall value of Axel Capital Management’s 13F portfolio stood at $78.3 million on March 31, down from $102 million a quarter earlier. The fund’s portfolio had a significant amount of turnover during the first quarter, as Nikolayevsky added 9 new stocks to it, while selling off 12 former positions. Nikolayevsky notably bailed on tech stocks during the quarter, lowering her exposure to the sector to just 18% as of March 31 from nearly 44% at the end of 2021. In their place, Nikolayevsky invested heavily in healthcare and finance stocks.\n\nIn this article, we’ll take a look at ten of the positions Nikolayevsky sold off during Q1, including Roblox and several other large tech holdings.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe following data is gathered from Axel Capital Management’s latest 13F filing with the SEC. We follow hedge funds like Axel Capital Management because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.\n\nAll hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2022 reporting period.\n\nAnna Nikolayevsky Is Selling Off Roblox and These 9 Stocks\n\n10.

QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is another, as the hedge fund manager unloaded her 8,000 shares of the semiconductor company during Q1.\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) continued to dominate the application processor market during Q1, taking home 44% of the market’s revenue. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a distant second at 26%, while MediaTek ranked third at 19%.\n\nMediaTek continues to rapidly close the gap with QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in the U.S system on a chip (SoC) market however. In April, QUALCOMM’s lead fell to just two percentage points at 47% to 45%, down from a 66% to 30% gap just a year earlier. While QUALCOMM maintains a sizable edge in the premium segments of the U.S market, MediaTek has taken control of the budget end of the market. The Taiwanese chipmaker is now setting its sights on the mid-range market, which appears to have QCOM (or former QCOM) investors like Nikolayevsky worried, as MediaTek’s high-performance, cost-effective chips could quickly supplant QUALCOMM’s offerings as the most desirable for smartphone makers.\n\n9.

(NYSE:NEE)\n\nFormer Value of Axel Capital Management‘s 13F Position: $2.33 million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders (as of March 31): 76\n\nDuring Q1, Anna Nikolayevsky sold off all 25,000 shares of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) her fund had owned as of December 31, closing the NEE position she had just opened during Q4. While we don’t know the exact timing of Nikolayevsky’s buying and selling of NEE shares, the moves appear to have worked out well for her. NEE shares gained 18.9% during Q4 before stumbling by 9.27% in Q1. They’ve lost another 16.7% of their value so far in Q2.\n\nWhile NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) delivered strong Q1 results in April, its forecast for the remainder of 2022 appears to be more muted, as the company did not raise its full-year EPS or distribution projections. Some of that tepid forecast is due to uncertainty surrounding a U.S. Department of Commerce anti-dumping review concerning solar cell and module makers in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia.\n\nNextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) believes that between 2.1 to 2.8 gigawatts of the company’s planned 2022 solar and storage build could be pushed into 2023 due to the uncertainty. A final ruling on the matter from the U.S. Department of Commerce isn’t expected until the end of August.\n\n8. Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM)\n\nFormer Value of Axel Capital Management‘s 13F Position: $2.44 million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders (as of March 31): 26\n\nAnna Nikolayevsky sold off 78% of her fund’s stake in Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) during Q4, reducing it to an even 100,000 shares. She finished the job in Q1, unloading her remaining 100,000 shares in Livent, which ranks as one of the 15 Most Valuable Lithium Companies in the World.\n\nThanks to rising lithium prices, Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) had an exceptionally profitable first quarter by its standards, earning $53 million. That quarterly profit was greater than the company’s profit during four of its past five full years. The performance also helped push LTHM shares up by 35% this year through late-May until a Goldman Sachs report threw some cold water on the stock’s sizzling trajectory.\n\nGoldman Sachs anticipates lithium prices will plunge by 73% next year, before rebounding somewhat in 2024 and beyond. With the stock having been bid up quite a bit in 2022, worried investors began bailing on Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) before the company’s profitability bails on them. LTHM shares have slumped by 26% since May 27.\n\n7. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)\n\nFormer Value of Axel Capital Management‘s 13F Position: $6.89 million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders (as of March 31): 72\n\nAxel Capital Management also unloaded its entire 5,000-share stake in Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) during Q1. It was far from the only fund to do so, as 18% of the company’s former hedge fund shareholders unloaded the stock from their 13F portfolios during the quarter.\n\nShopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) shares have been battered in 2022, losing 78% of their value amid recession fears, weakening e-commerce demand, and poor profitability from the company. Shopify widely missed earnings expectations in Q1, pulling in adjusted EPS of just $0.20, a mere fraction of the $0.88 that analysts were projecting. Revenue likewise missed the mark by a wide margin, coming in at $1.2 billion against $1.6 billion estimates.\n\nNot every hedge fund lost faith in Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) during Q1 however. Polen Capital used the stock’s downswing as an opportunity to further build its position in the company at what it believed to be an attractive valuation. The fund had this to say about Shopify in its Q1 2022 investor letter:\n\n“We added to the Portfolio’s position in e-commerce company Shopify in the first quarter after a sharp share-price decline. This brought the Portfolio’s weighting in the company to 2%. We believe Shopify provides a uniquely positioned platform, and we like the company’s strategy of continuing to invest in its business in an effort to strengthen its competitive advantages. The market’s affinity for businesses like Shopify may have changed, which created an opportunity for us to build our position in the company at what we believed to be compelling valuations.”\n\n6. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nFormer Value of Axel Capital Management‘s 13F Position: $7.35 million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders (as of March 31): 102\n\nClosing out the first half of the list is another chipmaker that Anna Nikolayevsky was selling during Q1, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). After selling off half her NVDA stake during Q4, 25,000 shares, she unloaded the remaining 25,000 shares during Q1. The sales appear to be well-timed, as NVDA shares gained 42% during Q4 and maintained most of those gains during Q1 after rebounding from a January slide in late-March. However, it’s been a different story in Q2, as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock has tumbled by 41%.\n\nOne of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds: 2022 Q1 Rankings, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the king of the gaming GPU market, with a sizable lead over its biggest rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). Having huge market share in a growing market is tremendous; having it in a shrinking market, not so much. The latter has been the case in recent quarters, as PC GPU shipments fell by 6.2% quarter-over-quarter during Q1, though NVIDIA’s shipments actually rose by 3.2%.\n\nNonetheless, NVIDIA investors appear to be concerned about the slowing gaming market now that global lockdowns are over, as well as the looming GPU competition from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), which is developing integrated GPU’s that could rival NVIDIA’s standalone offerings. AMD is also taking aim at NVIDIA’s burgeoning data center business, which recently surpassed its gaming division in quarterly revenue for the first time.\n\nIn the second-half of this article, we’ll take a look at Anna Nikolayevsky’s sales of prominent tech stocks Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), Meta Platforms, Inc.

"2022-06-11T13:21:07+00:00","Can Mixed Fundamentals Have A Negative Impact on Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) Current Share Price Momentum?","Livent (NYSE:LTHM) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 18% over the last three months. However, we wonder if the company's inconsistent financials would have any adverse impact on the current share price momentum. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Livent's  ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Livent\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Livent is:\n\n6.4% = US$55m ÷ US$849m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.06 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nLivent's Earnings Growth And 6.4% ROE\n\nWhen you first look at it, Livent's ROE doesn't look that attractive. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 17%. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 49% seen by Livent was probably the result of it having a lower ROE. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, as a next step, we compared Livent's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 7.8% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Livent is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nIs Livent Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nLivent doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which doesn't explain why the company's earnings have shrunk if it is retaining all of its profits. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Livent's performance. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

"2022-06-09T16:20:04+00:00","Earnings Estimates Rising for Livent (LTHM): Will It Gain?","Livent (LTHM) could be a solid choice for investors given the company's remarkably improving earnings outlook. While the stock has been a strong performer lately, this trend might continue since analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company.\n\nThe upward trend in estimate revisions for this supplier of performance lithium compounds reflects growing optimism of analysts on its earnings prospects, which should get reflected in its stock price. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. This insight is at the core of our stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank.\n\nThe five-grade Zacks Rank system, which ranges from a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record of outperformance, with Zacks #1 Ranked stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 2008.\n\nConsensus earnings estimates for the next quarter and full year have moved considerably higher for Livent, as there has been strong agreement among the covering analysts in raising estimates.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nCurrent-Quarter Estimate Revisions\n\nFor the current quarter, the company is expected to earn $0.30 per share, which is a change of +650% from the year-ago reported number.\n\nOver the last 30 days, one estimate has moved higher for Livent compared to no negative revisions. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 8.7%.\n\nCurrent-Year Estimate Revisions\n\nThe company is expected to earn $1.23 per share for the full year, which represents a change of +583.33% from the prior-year number.\n\nThe revisions trend for the current year also appears quite promising for Livent, with one estimate moving higher over the past month compared to no negative revisions. The consensus estimate has also received a boost over this time frame, increasing 11.05%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFavorable Zacks Rank\n\nThe promising estimate revisions have helped Livent earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank is a tried-and-tested rating tool that helps investors effectively harness the power of earnings estimate revisions and make the right investment decision. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) significantly outperform the S&P 500.\n\nBottom Line\n\nLivent shares have added 26.1% over the past four weeks, suggesting that investors are betting on its impressive estimate revisions.

"2022-06-07T13:35:01+00:00","Livent (LTHM) Just Overtook the 20-Day Moving Average","From a technical perspective, Livent (LTHM) is looking like an interesting pick, as it just reached a key level of support. LTHM recently overtook the 20-day moving average, and this suggests a short-term bullish trend.\n\nThe 20-day simple moving average is a popular trading tool. It provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period, and is beneficial to short-term traders since it smooths out price fluctuations and provides more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.\n\nThe 20-day moving average can show signals that are similar to other SMAs as well. If a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.\n\nLTHM could be on the verge of another rally after moving 24.3% higher over the last four weeks. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.\n\nThe bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account LTHM's positive earnings estimate revisions. There have been 5 revisions higher for the current fiscal year compared to none lower, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nInvestors may want to watch LTHM for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"2022-06-03T16:00:04+00:00","What Makes Livent (LTHM) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?","Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Livent (LTHM), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Livent currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for LTHM that show why this supplier of performance lithium compounds shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\n\nFor LTHM, shares are up 21.74% over the past week while the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry is up 5.09% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 3.81% compares favorably with the industry's 2.89% performance as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Livent have increased 24.16% over the past quarter, and have gained 46.17% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved -4.33% and 0.74%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to LTHM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. LTHM is currently averaging 4,449,896 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with LTHM.\n\nOver the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost LTHM's consensus estimate, increasing from $0.61 to $1.23 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that LTHM is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Livent on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Recently, LTHM's 50-day simple moving average broke out above its 200-day moving average; this is known as a ""golden cross.""\n\nConsidered an important signifier for a bullish breakout, a golden cross is a technical chart pattern that's formed when a stock's short-term moving average breaks above a longer-term moving average; the most common crossover involves the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.\n\nA successful golden cross event has three stages. It first begins when a stock's price on the decline bottoms out. Then, its shorter moving average crosses above its longer moving average, triggering a positive trend reversal. The third and final phase occurs when the stock maintains its upward momentum.\n\nA golden cross is the opposite of a death cross, another technical event that indicates bearish price movement may be on the horizon.\n\nLTHM could be on the verge of a breakout after moving 32.7% higher over the last four weeks. Plus, the company is currently a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank.\n\nThe bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account LTHM's positive earnings outlook for the current quarter. There have been 5 upwards revisions compared to none lower over the past 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up as well.

"2022-05-13T03:24:35+00:00","Albemarle Tops Our List of Lithium Stocks - Who Else is Worth Checking Out?","This article was first published on Simply Wall St News .\n\nLithium has been the talk of the town recently and it’s no secret as to why. Recent estimates from McKinsey suggest a global demand of around 3 million metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2030. In contrast, the total global LCE output for 2021 amounted to only 540,000 metric tons, a mere 18% of the anticipated need for 2030. These figures point to a potential shortfall in the future and questions are being raised over how this demand will be met.\n\nThe rise in this demand is attributed to an increase in consumer demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs). These EVs are requiring batteries that have higher energy densities and longer lifespans, the main component of which is high-grade lithium. The sudden rise in demand has caused raw lithium prices to skyrocket, leaving battery producers scrambling to secure their supply of a commodity that is quickly entering into a shortage. So this begs the question: Which companies are best positioned to take advantage? Mined production volume, modelled for 93% available capacity. Source: Minespans, McKinsey lithium demand model\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)\n\nAlbemarle is a global leader in the extraction and production of lithium, bromine and refining catalyst solutions. Lithium is undoubtedly the largest branch of the business, accounting for 42% of the US$3.3B in net sales for the 2021 calendar year. \r\nAt a current output of 88,000 metric tons of LCE per year, Albemarle asserts itself as a dominant player in the lithium market at 16% total market share. The company is poised to continue in a strong market popsition with plans expand processing infrastructure in 2022 and with the long-term goal of more than doubling their lithium production capacity. With this expansion pipeline, they'll be targeting low-cost juristictions to reduce capital expenditure and impove returns.\n\nHere are where we see Albemarle’s competitive advantage lay:\n\nProject feasibility. Albemarle has proved it can already economically produce battery grade lithium in a period where lithium prices were much lower, illustrating the company’s ability to continue operations should lithium prices fall. Ability to be self-funded. Albemarle's lithium branch is already profit making, so earnings can be retained and capital can be invested into the aforementioned expansion projects without the need for significant capital raises or taking on large amounts of debt. Smaller companies and emerging players will have to undergo financing stages which carry risks and may result in shareholder dilution.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlbemarle has a firm grasp on the market and seems positioned to continue riding this lithium wave from strength to strength. But these factors don’t paint the full picture and investors should always consider the financials of a company to inform their assessment. You can see our analysis of Albemarle’s financials for free on our website .\n\nSociedad Química y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM)\n\nSociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM) stands as the NYSE’s other lithium giant. Producing 101,000 metric tons of LCE during 2021, SQM’s impressive output accounts for 18.7% of global lithium production for the year and with several project expansions in the works, this output will continue to scale with the market demand.\n\nAccording to SQM’s latest earnings report, 2022 sales estimates top out at 140,000 metric tons of lithium, with capacity potentially reaching 190,000-200,000 should expansion projects be completed in time, and dependant on the market demand for lithium.\n\nHere are the key factors driving the company forward in the next few years:\n\nSignificant Expansion pipeline. With SQM’s joint venture in Mt Holland expecting to enter production in 2024 and a drastic increase to the production capabilities of their Salar del Carmen project, there’s ample opportunity for the company to grow their presence in the market and beat out new entrants. Variable exposure to lithium prices. Looking forward to 2022, SQM’s sales contracts are detailed as follows: 20% fixed or variable price, 50% variable price with a ceiling and 30% not contracted. This means that SQM will still be exposed to the increase in lithium prices on previously negotiated contracts even if the price of lithium was lower at the time the contract was agreed upon, opening the company up to increased revenues.\n\nInvestors should always consider the risks and financial health of a company to inform their investment decision. You can see our rundown of SQM’s risks and financials for free on our website .\n\nLivent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM)\n\nLivent’s premier resource is located in Salar Del Hombre Muerto in Argentina, achieving a reasonable current output of 27,000 metric tons of Lithium Carbonate and Lithium Chloride. While this is modest in comparison to the big players in the sector, expansion is at the forefront of the company’s mission, with a 20,0000 metric tons expansion of their Argentinian operation slated for 2023 and a further 20,000 metric tons anticipated for 2025.\n\nLivent’s production figures account for around 5% of the total market share. While this lags the other two companies, Livent’s key focus on cost leadership within the production of LCE, Lithium Hydroxide and Lithium Chloride should provide an advantage over its peers.\n\nThese are the factors that are important to the performance of Livent:\n\nLow cost focus. High lithium prices can make many more projects economically feasible, but striving for lower operating costs will mean a project can weather the storm if demand and prices fall. By securing a low-impurity lithium resource, Livent has allowed processing costs to be cut, giving a competitive advantage over other brine operations. Exposure to Lithium Carbonate, Lithium Chloride and Lithium Hydroxide prices. New high-density batteries are more compatible with lithium hydroxide owing to greater nickel content in the cathodes. Should primary lithium demand switch from carbonate to hydroxide, Livent’s exposure to the prices in both products should help it navigate pricing volatility.\n\nLivent is a smaller company and that does carry some possible risks. Investors who are interested in finding out more can do so for free on our website .\n\nThe Future Prospects\n\nWhen you take a step back and look at the global lithium sector, you begin to see a trend. Most supply comes from a select few companies, leaving a mass of newcomers are scrambling to secure funding to bring their projects to market. After all, there’s no shortage of lithium resources on Earth, just a shortage of processing power to extract it from the ground and refine it. New companies coming to the table will reach maturity and begin reaping the rewards of their capital investments. These next few companies aren’t generating significant revenues but we believe they’ll be ones to watch.\n\nLithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC)\n\nLithium Americas is an emerging player in the sector. Their flagship project is their Cauchari-Olaroz brine resource in Argentina, which is currently 85% through the construction of its Stage 1 production facility, targeting 40,000 metric tons per annum (tpa) of battery-grade lithium carbonate. Lithium Americas is striving for cost leadership, forecasting operating expenditure of US$3,600 per metric tonne. With a project life of 40 years and a second stage expansion already on the cards, there is plenty to keep investors following their developments closely.\n\nHere are some of the Lithium Americas’ most eye-catching features:\n\nCompleted acquisition of Millennial Lithium in January 2022. Lithium Americas now has 100% ownership of the advanced-stage Pastos Grandes project, which is located nearby to their Caucharí-Olaroz tenements. The transaction was completed for around US$400 million and provides Lithium Americas with exposure to a rich brine resource of 4.1 million metric tonnes of LCE. Continued development of Thacker Pass resource. Lithium Americas has a 100% stake in one of the largest resources in the United States. The project’s feasibility study is due in the second half of 2022, targeting 40,000 tpa of lithium carbonate, with scenarios being assessed for expansion up to a total of 80,0000 tpa. Preparation work to begin construction of the initial infrastructure is set to commence in 2022.\n\nFor those who are eager to find out more, you can do so by taking a look at the future growth section in our company report for Lithium Americas on our website .\n\nPiedmont Lithium Inc. (NASDAQ:PLL)\n\nPiedmont Lithium Inc. is a lithium company looking to develop key strategic assets in North Carolina, Quebec and Ghana. With a consolidated enterprise targeting 60,000 tonnes of LiOH per year and an additional 390,000 tonnes per year in spodumene concentrate (SC6) production, Piedmont is looking to become a significant player in America’s shift to newer energy initiatives.\n\nHere is why Piedmont Lithium’s future may become interesting:\n\nEntered into a binding agreement with Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to supply spodumene concentrate from their North Carolina project. The agreement is for an initial five-year term on a fixed price commitment representing one-third of Piedmont’s planned production from their North Carolina project. Deliveries planned to begin between July 2022 and July 2023, but timeline has been postponed indefinitely due to delays in development. The Carolina project offers industry leading sustainability with close proximity to a key target market. Piedmont owns 100% of the project which is set to lead the way in terms of cost and sustainability, offering much lower direct water usage in the processing of lithium hydroxide, requiring only 6,300 gallons per tonne of LiOH. Compare this to Chilean projects in the Atacama region which need up to 124,000 gallons of water per tonne, it’s clear to see where the benefits lay for Piedmont as water scarcity continues to be a frequent discussion point into the future.\n\nIf you’re looking to find out about the growth estimates for Piedmont Lithium Inc. (NASDAQ:PLL), we encourage you to take a deep dive into our coverage of analysts’ estimates for the company in our company report .\n\nStandard Lithium Ltd. (NYSE:SLI)\n\nStandard Lithium Ltd. is a steadily growing lithium prospect, headquartered out of Vancouver, Canada. Touting itself as “America’s 21st Century lithium company”, Standard Lithium vows to be the answer to the question of lithium supply but within an innovative context. Partnering with chemical major LANXESS AG (ETR:LXS) , the company is planning to implement ground-breaking technology and leverage their class leading resource to help them rise to the top of the lithium game.\n\nHere are some points of interest to kick-start your research into Standard Lithium:\n\nAbility to fast-track commercial brine operations using existing brine operations.

First to market with a revolutionary extraction process. Standard Lithium has developed its own direct lithium extraction (DLE) process called LiSTR. The company promotes this proprietary process as being able to deliver increased recovery efficiency when compared to traditional evaporation methods and a smaller environmental footprint. The most valuable part of this process is that it is scalable, modular and able to be bolted on the LANXESS’ existing bromine infrastructure, allowing Standard Lithium to bring their lithium to market more quickly than competitors.\n\nFor those that appreciate the future merits of Standard Lithium Ltd. (NYSE:SLI) and wish to know more about the company’s current financial health can do so by heading to the company report on our website.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWith expansion on the horizon for all of these companies, it appears that they’re all well positioned to tackle the impending energy revolution. But this shift to cleaner energy isn’t just going to impact lithium companies. Energy production, storage and personal transportation industries are primed to undergo rapid change as fossil fuels are phased out, paving the way for innovation.

"2022-05-12T10:12:32+00:00","News Flash: Analysts Just Made A Huge Upgrade To Their Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) Forecasts","Shareholders in Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) may be thrilled to learn that the analysts have just delivered a major upgrade to their near-term forecasts. The consensus estimated revenue numbers rose, with their view now clearly much more bullish on the company's business prospects.\n\nAfter the upgrade, the 13 analysts covering Livent are now predicting revenues of US$817m in 2022. If met, this would reflect a substantial 73% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Prior to the latest estimates, the analysts were forecasting revenues of US$585m in 2022. The consensus has definitely become more optimistic, showing a considerable lift to revenue forecasts.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Livent  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nThe consensus price target rose 9.3% to US$33.14, with the analysts clearly more optimistic about Livent's prospects following this update. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Livent at US$41.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$27.00. This shows there is still some diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.\n\nAnother way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. One thing stands out from these estimates, which is that Livent is forecast to grow faster in the future than it has in the past, with revenues expected to display 108% annualised growth until the end of 2022. If achieved, this would be a much better result than the 2.1% annual decline over the past three years. Compare this against analyst estimates for the broader industry, which suggest that (in aggregate) industry revenues are expected to grow 3.9% annually. So it looks like Livent is expected to grow faster than its competitors, at least for a while.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away from this upgrade is that analysts lifted their revenue estimates for this year. They're also forecasting more rapid revenue growth than the wider market. There was also an increase in the price target, suggesting that there is more optimism baked into the forecasts than there was previously. Seeing the dramatic upgrade to this year's forecasts, it might be time to take another look at Livent.\n\nAnalysts are definitely bullish on Livent, but no company is perfect. Indeed, you should know that there are several potential concerns to be aware of, including concerns around earnings quality.

Lithium stocks.\n\nSource: tunasalmon / Shutterstock\n\nLithium demand has soared over the past few years with the surging popularity of electric vehicles (EVs). Multiple market studies suggest that the industry will grow at an incredible pace over the next ten years. Hence, lithium stocks can potentially be lucrative investments down the line.\n\nLithium stocks have been performing well for the better parts of the past couple of years. A lot has to do with the mind-boggling growth in EV sales. In 2021, EV sales volume shot up to 6.7 million units, representing a 108% bump from 2020. By 2030, demand for lithium will rise to two million metric tons.\n\nLithium prices are rising aggressively as supply has failed to keep up with ballooning demand. Therefore, lithium-producing firms are in for some enticing price realization in the foreseeable future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for May With Yields Over 6%\n\nHere are three lithium stocks to invest in this month:\n\nLAC Lithium Americas Corp. $24.56 LTHM Livent Corporation $28.03 ALB Albemarle Corporation $242.50\n\nLithium Stocks: Lithium Americas (LAC) Lithium Americas logo on a phone screen in front of a computer showing their website. LAC stock.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is a lithium mining start-up with plenty of potential to profit from booming lithium demand. Moreover, with producer nations looking to foster a domestic production base, the company can benefit immensely from the trend.\n\nThe Canadian lithium miner has a couple of major lithium projects that could bring in the big bucks in the coming years. The first is its Argentinian lithium brine project called the Cauchari-Olaroz, which should commence production later this year. Moreover, it has also acquired one of its peers in Millennial Lithium, with major lithium mining assets in Argentina.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, LAC is working on another exciting project in Nevada called Thacker Pass. According to the company, it is the largest known lithium resource in the U.S. However, it has been the subject of controversy, but it could be a massive money-spinner for LAC stock if it gets through the legal hurdles.\n\nLivent Corporation (LTHM) Livent Corporation logo on a phone screen. LTHM stock.\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nLivent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) is one of the top integrated pure-play lithium producers. It sells lithium compounds to EV original equipment manufacturers and leading battery makers across the globe. International diversity has been one of its key differentiators, which gives it access to multiple manufacturers. It produces lithium with the lowest-cost resources, giving it a major competitive advantage. Livent currently has over 20,000 metric tons production capacity, which could double by the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe firm has been extracting lithium from Salar del Hombre Muerto in Argentina for the past two decades. It also produces qualified battery-grade lithium in the U.S. and China and is on track for capacity expansions.\n\n7 Restaurant Stocks Ready for a 'Revenge Travel' Rally\n\nMoreover, the financials are rock solid for the business, with revenues above 45% in the past year. Additionally, its EBITDA growth was at a spectacular 365% for the year. With the rising lithium demand and stronger margins, the business is in for another robust showing this year and beyond.\n\nLithium Stocks: Albemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) is a specialty chemicals producer that aims to expand its lithium business rapidly. It’s not a sector pure-play, but its lithium segment now accounts for 41% of total revenues and over 50% of its adjusted EBITDA. Last year, its lithium business grew at 19% compared to just 6% of total revenue growth. Albemarle’s lithium business will become a major growth catalyst, with the industry expected to grow extensively over the next few years.\n\nThe company has been investing heavily in acquiring lithium mining and converting properties in recent years. For instance, it acquired lithium converting giant Guangxi Tianyuan Corporation, strengthening its position in China. Moreover, Albermarle has a 49% stake in the Greenbushes mine, producing more than 60,000 metric tons every year.\n\nIn terms of financials, the firm has been knocking it out of the park. Its top- and bottom-line performance last year tracked well over its five-year averages. Additionally, it has been a dividend aristocrat, boasting 28 consecutive years of growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This compares to earnings of $0.02 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 50%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this supplier of performance lithium compounds would post earnings of $0.07 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.08, delivering a surprise of 14.29%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nLivent , which belongs to the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry, posted revenues of $143.5 million for the quarter ended March 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.92%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $91.7 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nLivent shares have lost about 12.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -12.8%.\n\nWhat's Next for Livent?\n\nWhile Livent has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Livent: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.16 on $144.1 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.62 on $582.77 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Chemical - Specialty is currently in the top 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, American Vanguard (AVD), has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2022. The results are expected to be released on May 4.\n\nThis agricultural products company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.20 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +100%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nAmerican Vanguard's revenues are expected to be $130.5 million, up 12.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Reported GAAP net income was $53.2 million, 609% higher than the previous quarter, and 28 cents per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA was $53.3 million, 94% higher than the previous quarter, and adjusted earnings per share were 21 cents per diluted share. Further improvement in lithium market conditions and strong customer demand in the first quarter supported higher realized prices than anticipated at the beginning of the year.\n\n""Strong lithium demand growth has continued in 2022,"" said Paul Graves, president and chief executive officer of Livent. ""Published lithium prices in all forms have increased rapidly amid very tight market conditions and Livent continues to achieve higher realized prices across its entire product portfolio.""\n\nCapacity Expansion Update\n\nLivent remains on schedule to deliver all previously announced capacity expansions. The Company has also announced significant additional capacity expansions for both lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, as Livent continues to grow its production to meet future demand from its customers.\n\nLithium Carbonate\n\nIn its first expansion in Argentina, Livent is on track to add 10,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate capacity by the first quarter of 2023. Another 10,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate capacity is expected to be added in Argentina by the end of 2023, which will nearly double Livent's total available LCEs (1) from 2021 levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Company also announced last quarter that it began engineering work on a second capacity expansion in Argentina. Following completion of a preliminary analysis, this expansion is now expected to add an additional 30,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate capacity by the end of 2025, or 10,000 metric tons more than previously announced. By re-engineering the use of fresh water, the second expansion will not require access to any additional fresh water. It also allows Livent to improve overall lithium yields and reduce water use intensity for current and future operations.\n\nLivent has also begun evaluating a third expansion in Argentina that would add up to 30,000 metric tons of additional lithium carbonate capacity. This expansion would deploy a more conventional pond evaporation-based process and require significantly less capital versus prior expansions. Following the third expansion, Livent believes it can reach total capacity at its operations in Argentina of 100,000 metric tons by the end of 2030.\n\nLithium Hydroxide\n\nThe Company announces that it expects to add another 15,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide capacity at a new location in China by the end of 2023. Additionally, Livent is evaluating building a new facility in either North America or Europe that would process lithium material from battery recycling processes into lithium hydroxide. The Company is exploring multiple opportunities for partnership and funding and believes the new facility could be in operation by the end of 2025, with production capacity of at least 10,000 metric tons.\n\nLivent is also nearing completion of its 5,000 metric tons expansion of lithium hydroxide capacity in Bessemer City that will start commercial production in the second half of this year.\n\nFollowing these expansions, Livent expects to have total lithium hydroxide capacity of at least 55,000 metric tons by the end of 2025 (excluding Nemaska), more than double its existing hydroxide capacity of 25,000 metric tons.\n\nNemaska\n\nYesterday, Livent announced that it has agreed to double its ownership interest in Nemaska Lithium Inc. (""Nemaska"") to 50% by issuing 17,500,000 shares of Livent common stock. Nemaska is a fully integrated lithium hydroxide development project with 34,000 metric tons of nameplate capacity located in Québec, Canada. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including, among other things, the expiration of certain notice periods required by applicable law. For more information regarding the transaction, please refer to the press release issued yesterday that can be found on livent.com.\n\nGuidance and Outlook (2)\n\nLivent has significantly increased its guidance for 2022 financial performance. With no projected change in volumes, this is driven by higher expected realized prices across all lithium products. For the full year, Livent now projects revenue to be in the range of $755 million to $835 million and Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $290 million to $350 million.\n\n($ million) Revised FY 2022 Guidance Prior FY 2022 Guidance Actual FY 2021 Revised YoY Growth (midpoint) Revenue 755 – 835 540 – 600 420 Up 89% Adj.

Although we provide a forecast for Adjusted EBITDA, we are not able to forecast the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Certain elements of the composition of the GAAP amount are not predictable, making it impractical for us to forecast such GAAP measure or to reconcile corresponding non-GAAP financial measure to such GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts. For the same reason, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Such elements include, but are not limited to, restructuring, transaction related charges, and related cash activity.

We evaluate operating performance using certain Non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, which we define as net income/(loss) plus interest expense, net, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization; and Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as EBITDA adjusted for restructuring and other charges, separation-related costs/(income) and certain other losses/(gains). Management believes the use of these Non-GAAP measures allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of its underlying business from period to period. The Non-GAAP information provided may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies because of differing methods used by other companies in calculating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. This measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income/(loss) or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The above table reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from net income/(loss). a.  Represents impact of currency fluctuations on tax assets and liabilities and long-term monetary assets associated with our capital expansion as well as foreign currency devaluations. The remeasurement losses are included within ""Cost of sales"" in our condensed consolidated statement of operations but are excluded from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because of: i.) their nature as income tax related; ii.) their association with long-term capital projects which will not be operational until future periods; or iii.) the severity of the devaluations and their immediate impact on our operations in the country. b.  We continually perform strategic reviews and assess the return on our business. This sometimes results in management changes or in a plan to restructure the operations of our business. As part of these restructuring plans, demolition costs and write-downs of long-lived assets may occur. Three months ended March 31, 2022 includes $0.5 million of severance costs for management changes at certain administrative facilities and $0.4 million for miscellaneous nonrecurring costs. Three months ended March 31, 2021 consists primarily of transaction-related legal fees and miscellaneous nonrecurring costs.  c.  Represents legal and professional fees and other separation-related activity. d.  Represents incremental costs associated with COVID-19 recorded in ""Cost of sales"" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations, including but not limited to, incremental quarantine-related absenteeism, incremental facility cleaning costs, COVID-19 testing, pandemic-related supplies and personal protective equipment for employees, among other costs; offset by economic relief provided by foreign governments. e.  Three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 represents our 25% indirect interest in transaction costs incurred for the Nemaska Transaction, certain project-related costs and interest expense, all included in Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. f.  Represents the gain from the sale in Argentina pesos of Argentina Sovereign U.S. dollar-denominated bonds and is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because it is nonrecurring. g.  Represents interest income received from the Argentina government for the period beginning when the recoverability of certain of our expansion-related VAT receivables were approved by the Argentina government and ending on the date when the reimbursements were paid by the Argentina government but is excluded from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because of its association with long-term capital projects which will not be operational until future periods.\n\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME/(LOSS) (GAAP) TO ADJUSTED AFTER-TAX EARNINGS (NON-GAAP) (Unaudited) (in Millions, Except Per Share Data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Net income/(loss) $ 53.2 $ (0.8) Special charges: Argentina remeasurement losses (a) 1.0 2.3 Restructuring and other charges (b) 1.0 0.3 Separation-related costs/(income) (c) 0.1 (0.1) COVID-19 related costs (d) 0.8 0.9 Other loss (e) 1.6 1.1 Blue Chip Swap gain (f) (14.0) — Argentina interest income (g) (1.5) — Non-GAAP tax adjustments (i) (2.2) (0.3) Adjustment for interest, net of tax, on 2025 Notes assumed converted (Non-GAAP) (h) — 0.2 Adjusted after-tax earnings (Non-GAAP) (1)  $ 40.0 $ 3.6 Diluted earnings/(loss) per common share (GAAP) $ 0.28 $ (0.01) Special charges per diluted share, before tax: Argentina remeasurement losses, per diluted share 0.01 0.01 Restructuring and other charges, per diluted share 0.01 — COVID-19 related costs, per diluted share — 0.01 Other loss, per diluted share 0.01 0.01 Blue Chip Swap gain, per diluted share (0.08) — Argentina interest income, per diluted share (0.01) — Non-GAAP tax adjustments, per diluted share (0.01) — Diluted adjusted after-tax earnings per share (Non-GAAP) (1) $ 0.21 $ 0.02 Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted (Non-GAAP) used in diluted \r\nadjusted after-tax earnings per share computations 191.4 176.0\n\n___________________ 1. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures ""Adjusted after-tax earnings"" and ""Diluted adjusted after-tax earnings per share"" provide useful information about the Company's operating results to management, investors and securities analysts. Adjusted after-tax earnings excludes the effects of special charges and tax-related adjustments. The Company also believes that excluding the effects of these items from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of its underlying business from period to period. Diluted adjusted after-tax earnings per share (Non-GAAP) is calculated using weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted.  a.  Represents impact of currency fluctuations on tax assets and liabilities and long-term monetary assets associated with our capital expansion as well as foreign currency devaluations.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, $2.9 million and $2.6 million of the interest on the 2025 Notes was capitalized, respectively. i.  The Company excludes the GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from the Non-GAAP measure of income, and instead includes a Non-GAAP tax provision based upon the projected annual Non-GAAP effective tax rate. The GAAP tax provision includes certain discrete tax items including, but not limited to: income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to operating results in the current year; tax adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency remeasurement of certain foreign operations; certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years; certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets and related interim accounting impacts; and, changes in tax law. Management believes excluding these discrete tax items assists investors and securities analysts in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to operating results thereby providing investors with useful supplemental information about the Company's operational performance. The income tax expense/(benefit) on special charges/(income) is determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which the special charge or income occurred and includes both current and deferred income tax expense/(benefit) based on the nature of the Non-GAAP performance measure.\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in Millions) 2022 2021 Non-GAAP tax adjustments: Income tax expense/(benefit) on restructuring, separation-related and other corporate costs $ 0.1 $ (0.5) Foreign currency remeasurement and other discrete items (3.9) (1.1) Blue Chip Swap gain 1.4 — Other discrete items  0.2 1.3 Total Non-GAAP tax adjustments $ (2.2) $ (0.3)\n\nRECONCILIATION OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES (GAAP) TO ADJUSTED CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS (NON-GAAP) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, (in Millions) 2022 2021 Cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 10.8 $ 12.7 Restructuring and other charges 0.2 0.2 Separation-related costs/(income) 0.4 (0.7) COVID-19 related costs (a) 0.8 0.9 Adjusted cash provided by operations (Non-GAAP) (1) $ 12.2 $ 13.1\n\n___________________ 1.

Adjusted cash provided by operations excludes the effects of transaction-related cash flows. The Company also believes that excluding the effects of these items from cash provided by operating activities allows management and investors to compare more easily the cash flows from period to period. a.  Represents incremental costs associated with COVID-19 recorded in ""Cost of sales"" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations, including but not limited to, incremental quarantine-related absenteeism, incremental facility cleaning costs, COVID-19 testing, pandemic-related supplies and personal protective equipment for employees, among other costs; offset by economic relief provided by foreign governments.\n\nRECONCILIATION OF LONG-TERM DEBT (GAAP) AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS (GAAP) TO NET DEBT (NON-GAAP) (Unaudited) (in Millions) March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Long-term debt (GAAP) (a) $ 240.8 $ 240.4 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (GAAP) (68.5) (113.0) Net debt (Non-GAAP) (1) $ 172.3 $ 127.4\n\n___________________ 1.

"2022-05-03T19:49:10+00:00","Livent (NYSE:LTHM) May Have Issues Allocating Its Capital","If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Although, when we looked at Livent (NYSE:LTHM), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Livent is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.038 = US$41m ÷ (US$1.2b - US$131m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).\n\nThus, Livent has an ROCE of 3.8%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Chemicals industry average of 12%.\n\nView our latest analysis for Livent  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Livent's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Livent here  for free.\n\nThe Trend Of ROCE\n\nIn terms of Livent's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 17% over the last five years. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Livent's ROCE\n\nWhile returns have fallen for Livent in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. Furthermore the stock has climbed 95% over the last three years, it would appear that investors are upbeat about the future. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne more thing, we've spotted  3 warning signs  facing Livent that you might find interesting.\n\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this freelist of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

"2022-05-02T20:10:00+00:00","Livent Announces Agreement to Double its Ownership Stake in Nemaska Lithium to 50 Percent","PHILADELPHIA, May 2, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Livent Corporation (NYSE: LTHM) today announced that it has agreed to double its ownership interest to 50% in Nemaska Lithium Inc. (""Nemaska""), a fully integrated lithium hydroxide development project located in Québec, Canada. Livent will issue 17,500,000 shares of its common stock to The Pallinghurst Group (""Pallinghurst"") and its investors to acquire their half of Québec Lithium Partners (""QLP""). Livent already owns the other half of QLP. Following the close of the transaction, QLP will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Livent, and Livent will in turn own 50% of Nemaska through QLP. Investissement Québec (""IQ"") will remain the owner of the remaining 50% interest in Nemaska. Livent Corporation (PRNewsfoto/Livent Corporation)\n\n""Livent is committed to the success of the Nemaska lithium project and increasing its ownership reflects this commitment,"" said Paul Graves, president and chief executive officer of Livent. ""We believe that Nemaska, as a large and low-cost integrated lithium hydroxide project, will be an important part of the supply of sustainable critical battery materials. Nemaska will further strengthen Livent's global footprint and is strategically located to serve growing lithium demand in North America and Europe. We will continue to work closely alongside the Government of Québec to ensure that Nemaska becomes a leading supplier of battery-grade hydroxide. The progress of Nemaska to its current advanced stage of engineering would not have been possible without the critical contributions of Pallinghurst and we look forward to continuing to work with them on further development of Nemaska, as a major investor in Livent.""\n\nLivent will continue to have responsibilities with Nemaska in the development and future production and commercialization of the project. Further information regarding its investment will be provided during Livent's upcoming earnings call on May 3rd, 2022.\n\n""Nemaska has made significant progress with its strategic plans under QLP's leadership. We will merge our interests in an all-share transaction and our investors are excited to continue to be exposed to Nemaska as long-term shareholders in Livent,"" said Arne H. Frandsen and Andrew Willis, Co-Founders and Managing Partners of Pallinghurst. ""We are committed to the success of Nemaska through our investment in Livent, as part of the development of Pallinghurst's broader battery materials presence in Québec.""\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the past eighteen months, the Nemaska team and its shareholders have invested significant resources in securing the future of Nemaska, including progressing an optimization study focused on improving and enhancing the entire value chain from mine to battery grade materials. In doing so, it has ensured a strong focus on sustainability and a zero-carbon footprint through the use of green hydroelectric power and the implementation of strong ESG principles. The conclusion of this optimization study and a final construction decision are expected by the end of the third quarter of this year. Nemaska is expected to be a fully integrated asset with 34,000 metric tons of nameplate capacity of battery-grade lithium hydroxide with first production in 2025.\n\nThe transaction will fully settle all financial obligations of Livent towards Pallinghurst. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including, among other things, the expiration of certain notice periods required by applicable law.\n\nAbout Livent For nearly eight decades, Livent has partnered with its customers to safely and sustainably use lithium to power the world.

"2022-04-26T19:01:07+00:00","Livent (LTHM) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release","The market expects Livent (LTHM) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 3, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis supplier of performance lithium compounds is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.14 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +600%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $139.43 million, up 52.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.44% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nPrice, Consensus and EPS Surprise Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for LTHM\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Livent?\n\nFor Livent, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.78%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Livent will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Livent would post earnings of $0.07 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.08, delivering a surprise of +14.29%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nLivent doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more lithium stocks available at bargain prices, go directly to 5 Cheap Lithium Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nLithium is one of the hottest sectors of the market as demand far outstrips supply. As electric vehicle (EV) adoption increases, the lithium market is expected to strengthen even further in 2022. Data from S&P Global indicates that prices for seaborne lithium carbonate climbed more than 400% in 2021. S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that lithium chemical supply is forecast to reach 636,000 mt lithium carbonate equivalent in 2022. In 2020 and 2021, this figure stood at around 408,000 mt and 497,000 mt, respectively.\n\nAs lithium becomes a sought-after commodity, the fight over control of the resource is also growing. A spokesperson of Chinese mining firm Tianqi Lithium told S&P Global Platts that it was becoming more difficult to obtain and control lithium resources as the “strategic significance” of the material grew. Global EV sales are also increasing and therefore lifting the lithium industry. Platts Analytics estimates that light-duty EV sales will rise to 10.5 million units by 2025, up from 6 million units in 2021.\n\nAmid this boom, several lithium firms are seeking to boost capacity to meet surging demand. Lithium demand will climb over 30% by 2025, per conservative estimates. Investors seeking to profit from this activity should consider the best lithium stocks in the EV space. Some of the top stocks in the EV sector presently include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe companies that are trading at relatively cheap prices compared to their growth potential were selected for the list. The real-time share prices of the stocks, as of April 18, are mentioned alongside other details for further clarity.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks were also considered.

(NYSE:SQM) as the stock hit our price target. Lithium prices remain at levels well below previous highs and while we expect they may reach higher levels in the future; high pricing likely encourages additional supply onto the market.”\n\n9.

(NYSE:LAC) has resulted in solid returns via our options trades around our core equity position. At the current time, we are short calls on LAC, as we have done multiple times throughout the position’s life, expiring on May 21, 2021, at a $17.5 and $22.5 strike price. The volume of contracts sold at each strike corresponds to the size of the equity position we want should the calls expire in the money, and the underlying equity gets called away from us. The thought process behind this trade construction is that if we know the size of the position we want at a particular price point, there is no reason not to accumulate additional returns by pre-selling the stock we would have sold anyway.\n\nHigh levels of volatility positively impact the price of options, increasing the premium we can earn from selling covered calls. To date, we have sold covered calls on Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) that have expired worthless four times, yielding a roughly 7% return on the equity position’s current value or 71bps for the portfolio overall.

QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 26\n\nReal-Time Share Price as of April 18: $18.21\n\nQuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS) engages in the development and commercialization of solid-state lithium-metal batteries. The stock has gained since late March after reports indicated that the company had signed a deal with German carmaker Volkswagen to integrate solid state batteries into their Porsche electric vehicles. The Porsche brand expects its sales mix of EVs to hit 50% within the next three years. The German carmaker is considering an initial public offering for Porsche as well.\n\nOn March 28, SMBC Nikko analyst Srini Pajjuri maintained a Neutral rating on QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS) stock with a price target of $20, noting that the solid state batteries the firm was developing had the potential to revolutionize the EV industry. However, the analyst cautioned that the execution risk with the firm was high.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, 26 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $157 million in QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS), compared to 25 in the preceding quarter worth $197 million.\n\nIn addition to Tesla, Inc.

Here is what the fund said:\n\n“QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS) is an early-stage developer of solid-state battery technology for electric vehicles aimed at improving key aspects of batteries, including safety, charging times, energy density, and cost. The company went public via a SPAC in November. After rapid appreciation, the stock came under pressure when the company raised additional capital to help accelerate its commercialization process. We exited our small position, as described below.\n\nWe sold QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS), an early-stage solid-state electric vehicle battery innovator, because it was an undersized position with an ambitious valuation. We will continue to monitor QuantumScape’s developments and may revisit the company as an investment at a future point in time.""\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Cheap Lithium Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 Best Roth IRA Stocks to Buy According to Reddit 10 Best Dividend Stocks for Roth IRA 10 Best Money Saving Tips According to Experts\n\nDisclosure.

This change was narrower than the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.21%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.33%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.49%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the supplier of performance lithium compounds had gained 8.64% over the past month, outpacing the Basic Materials sector's gain of 7.06% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.85% in that time.\n\nLivent will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be May 3, 2022. On that day, Livent is projected to report earnings of $0.14 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 600%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $139.43 million, up 52.05% from the year-ago period.\n\nLTHM's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $0.62 per share and revenue of $582.77 million. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +244.44% and +38.62%, respectively.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Livent should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 14.85, so we one might conclude that Livent is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that LTHM currently has a PEG ratio of 1.18. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Chemical - Specialty industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.78 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Chemical - Specialty industry is part of the Basic Materials sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 154, putting it in the bottom 40% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

"2022-04-06T16:00:04+00:00","Here's Why Momentum Investors Will Love Livent (LTHM)","Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Livent (LTHM), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Livent currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for LTHM that show why this supplier of performance lithium compounds shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor LTHM, shares are up 7.1% over the past week while the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry is down 0.01% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 17.22% compares favorably with the industry's 6.11% performance as well.\n\nConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Livent have risen 5.7%, and are up 44.9% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved -3.39% and 12.49%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to LTHM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. LTHM is currently averaging 2,520,705 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with LTHM.\n\nOver the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost LTHM's consensus estimate, increasing from $0.48 to $0.62 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that LTHM is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Livent on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"2022-04-01T19:00:00+00:00","Biden's SPR Release Sends Oil Prices Below $100","The unprecedented decision by Biden to release 180 million barrels of oil from the country's strategic petroleum reserve over the next six months has sent oil prices below $100. While plenty of upside risks remain, oil prices are on course to see their largest weekly decline in two years.\n\nOilprice Alert. The decision by Biden to release 180 million barrels of oil from the SPR demonstrates just how desperate the situation in oil markets has become. Make sure you sign up for Global Energy Alert to read this week's analysis of what it all means.\n\nFriday, April 1st, 2022\n\nIn a week that saw OPEC+ implementing its latest production increases and the United States announcing an unprecedented SPR release, oil prices saw their largest weekly decline in more than 2 years. Whilst the OPEC+ decision was far from a surprise, the readiness of the Biden administration to tame runaway fuel prices pushed Brent futures closer to the $100 per barrel mark. Despite the scope and ambition of Biden's latest move, it might not be enough to keep WTI below $100 per barrel as the sheer size of Russia’s potentially sanctionable 3 million b/d seaborne flow still looms over markets.\n\nOPEC+ Sticks to Modest Oil Output Increases. In a meeting that lasted a mere 12 minutes, OPEC+ countries agreed to add 432,000 b/d of production in May 2022 despite prospects of Russian production faltering, resisting calls from the IEA and US to ramp up production.\n\nUS Launches the Largest-Ever SPR Release. The Biden Administration kickstarted the largest-ever release of SPR crude in an attempt to bring down gasoline prices, pledging to release 180 million barrels over the next six months, equivalent to a steady 1 million b/d stream of crude.\n\nRussia Doubles Down on its Rouble Threat. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Thursday mandating buyers of Russian gas from ‘unfriendly countries’ to open rouble accounts in Russian banks and use those accounts to settle payments for gas delivered by Gazprom (MCX:GAZP).\n\nStory continues\n\nUS Warns India Not to Buy Too Much Russian Oil. The US State Department started expressing its discontent over India’s buying spree of heavily discounted Russian barrels, saying that any tangible increase would put New Delhi at a ‘great risk’ as Washington will try to restrict other countries’ purchases.\n\nRelated: Sanctions Are Forcing Russian Companies To Consider Moving To Kazakhstan\n\nGazprom’s European Offices Raided Amid New Probe. The German offices of Russia’s gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) were raided by EU antitrust regulation officers, adding another twist to previous accusations of withholding gas supplies to Europe.\n\nChina’s CNOOC Intends to Leave North Sea Projects. China’s state-owned offshore producer CNOOC (HKG:0883) is readying to leave one of the North Sea’s largest fields, Buzzard, despite being its operator with a 43.2% ownership stake, seeking to garner $3 billion from the transaction.\n\nOPEC Removes IEA From Source List. In another swing at the International Energy Agency, OPEC officials voted to remove the IEA from its list of ‘official’ secondary sources used to gauge production rates of OPEC member countries.\n\nTesla Signs Secret Nickel Deal with Vale. US EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reportedly signed an undisclosed multi-year supply deal with Brazilian mining giant VALE (NYSE:VALE) for the supply of nickel coming from its mines in Canada.\n\nUS Authorities Want More Ethanol in Gasoline. The Biden Administration is considering the temporary removal of restrictions on summer sales of higher-ethanol gasoline as a means to decrease gasoline costs across the country, reversing a previous decision to ban E15 as it contributes to smog in hot weather.\n\nICE Wants to Move Clearing to Chicago. The Intercontinental Exchange is mulling a move to shift the clearing of credit default swaps (CDS) from London to Chicago as pressure from the European Union implies that ICE would no longer be able to serve EU customers after June 2025.\n\nUS Lithium Miners Up on Biden EV Battery Push. Shares of US lithium producers such as Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) or Livent (NYSE:LTHM) shot up this week after media reports on the Biden Administration seeking to invoke a law to encourage domestic production of EV battery metals.\n\nBrussels Takes UK to WTO Court over Subsidies. The European Union launched a dispute with the United Kingdom at the World Trade Organization, arguing that London’s subsidies for low-carbon energy generation projects break WTO rules by making local content rules a part of the selection process.\n\nPDVSA Seeking to Buy Tankers. In a move that could foreshadow an easing of US sanctions vis-à-vis Venezuela, the Latin American country’s oil company PDVSA has reportedly been looking to buy and lease several oil tankers to refresh its 30-ship fleet, paying the seller back in Venezuelan barrels.\n\nBunker Contamination Sends Shockwaves Across Singapore. Singapore is seeing a streak of claims coming from shipowners that have found chlorinated contaminants in their bunker fuel, leading to power loss and fuel engine blackouts.\n\nBy Josh Owens for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nRussian Crude Continues To Flow Despite Harsh Sanctions Why We Cannot Just “Unplug” Our Current Energy System Europe Is Facing Supply Disruptions As Russia’s Gas-For-Rubles Deadline Looms\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bidens-spr-release-sends-oil-190000628.html","ALB.US","CL.COMM","GAZP.MCX","IC2.F","ICE.US","LTHM.US","OGZPY.US","TL0.F","TL0.XETRA","TSLA.MX","TSLA.US","TSLA34.SA","VALE.US","","","","BARRELS OF OIL","BIDEN","BIDEN ADMINISTRATION","FUEL PRICES","IEA","OIL PRICES","OPEC","PRODUCTION INCREASES","UNPRECEDENTED DECISION","","","","","-0.833","0.059","0.888","0.053"

"2022-03-27T12:03:32+00:00","The Trend Of High Returns At James Latham (LON:LTHM) Has Us Very Interested","Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of James Latham (LON:LTHM) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for James Latham:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.30 = UK£46m ÷ (UK£204m - UK£50m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2021).\n\nTherefore, James Latham has an ROCE of 30%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Trade Distributors industry average of 14%.\n\nSee our latest analysis for James Latham  roce\n\nHistorical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for James Latham's ROCE against it's prior returns. If you'd like to look at how James Latham has performed in the past in other metrics, you can view this freegraph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For James Latham Tell Us?\n\nInvestors would be pleased with what's happening at James Latham. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 30%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 68%.
