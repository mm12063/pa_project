"2019-09-30T22:14:00+00:00","Lithium Americas Announces 40,000 TPA Feasibility Study for the Caucharí-Olaroz Lithium Project","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Sept.  30, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC) (""Lithium Americas"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to provide results of a 40,000 tonnes per annum (“tpa”) definitive feasibility study (“40,000 tpa DFS"" or “DFS”) on the Caucharí-Olaroz lithium project (""Caucharí-Olaroz"" or the “Project”) currently under construction in Jujuy Province, Argentina. Caucharí-Olaroz is 100% owned by Minera Exar S.A. (“Minera Exar”), a 50/50 joint venture between Lithium Americas and Ganfeng Lithium Co., Ltd. (“Ganfeng Lithium”). Lithium Americas and Ganfeng Lithium have authorized Minera Exar to proceed with the plan to produce 40,000 tpa of battery-quality lithium carbonate (“Li2CO3”) as outlined in the DFS.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all figures are quoted in U.S. dollars (""$"") and are reported on a 100% equity project basis.\n\nHighlights:\n\n40,000 tpa of Li2CO3 production for 40 years.

Please see the discussion included at the end of this press release under “Non-IFRS Financial Measures”.\n\n""With construction underway and funding in place, the results of the 40,000 tpa DFS further supports Caucharí-Olaroz as a scalable, high-purity source of lithium carbonate for battery material customers,” commented Jon Evans, President and CEO of Lithium Americas. “We are thankful for the hard work from the team at Minera Exar, the support from the government of Jujuy, and our 50/50 joint venture partner, Ganfeng Lithium, for their financial and technical contributions towards optimizing the process design and securing key equipment for the lithium carbonate plant.”\n\n""Minera Exar is committed to building Caucharí-Olaroz to be one of the most environmentally responsible lithium projects globally,” commented Gabriel Rubacha, CEO of Minera Exar. “The 40,000 tpa DFS represents the first of future potential long-term investments in Caucharí-Olaroz for the benefit of the local communities, employees and Jujuy Province.”\n\nProject Details\n\nCaucharí-Olaroz is located in Jujuy Province in north west Argentina. The Project is situated in the Salar de Olaroz and Salar de Caucharí, adjacent to Orocobre Ltd.’s Olaroz facility, which has been in production since 2015. The Project is well serviced by nearby infrastructure including major paved highways which connect to the port of Antofagasta in Chile, a high-voltage transmission line, an adjacent 300MW solar project and a gas pipeline.\n\nIn 2012, Minera Exar granted a conditional right to Jujuy Energia y Mineria Sociedad del Estado (“JEMSE”), a mining and energy investment company owned by the government of Jujuy Province in Argentina, to acquire an 8.5% equity interest in Minera Exar and provide management services as required to develop the Project.\n\nThe 40,000 tpa DFS includes a conventional, commercially-proven brine processing technology optimized from the salar in partnership with Ganfeng Lithium to produce battery-quality Li2CO3 that can be used to meet the specifications of battery material producers in manufacturing cathode and electrolyte for lithium-ion batteries. The DFS follows the 2017 feasibility study on a 25,000 tpa Li2CO3 project (“25,000 tpa DFS”).\n\nMinera Exar has more than 250 employees and approximately 500 contractors at the Project. Construction is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2020.\n\nConstruction of the evaporation ponds commenced in Q1 2018 and is approximately 60% completed. Brine from production wells started filling ponds in Q4 2018. The liming purification process at the ponds is expected to commence in Q2 2020.\n\nA significant amount of long-lead time equipment purchases and construction contracts have been awarded. Contractors for the production wells, ponds and liners, civil works (roads and well platforms), permanent camp, concrete works and structural steel (buildings) are engaged at the Project site. Equipment components for the lithium carbonate plant are expected to begin arriving to the site later this year.\n\nPermitting\n\nAn update to the “Environmental Impacts Report for Exploitation” for Caucharí-Olaroz was approved by Jujuy Province in 2017 providing all necessary permits to support the 25,000 tpa DFS. In accordance with the provincial requirements, an update was submitted in August 2019 and is currently being evaluated by the Jujuy Province to expand the initial production capacity to 40,000 tpa of Li2CO3. This update includes supplementary environmental studies and information collected during the previous two years as well as changes to the Project description to reflect the current development plan and increased production capacity.\n\nBrine Process\n\nThe process presented in the 40,000 tpa DFS follows industry standards: pumping brine from the salar, concentrating the brine through evaporation ponds, and bringing the brine concentrate through an extractive hydrometallurgical and purification process to produce battery-quality Li2CO3. The updated process has been refined and optimized using the results of lab and pilot scale testing by Minera Exar, Ganfeng Lithium and equipment suppliers with experience in manufacturing the industrial equipment that Ganfeng Lithium uses for the production of high-purity products.\n\nAn average evaporation rate of 6.05 mm per day (2,157 mm per year) was used as criterion to design the pond system.  The rate corresponds to measured evaporation rates observed at the site where the ponds are located. At the demonstrated evaporation rate, the total evaporation area required to produce 40,000 tpa of Li2CO3 is 1,200 ha (12 km2) and includes allowances for salt harvesting and maintenance work. The ponds are designed with multi-layer liners consisting of a polymer-based material and engineered granular bedding. The evaporation ponds have been designed with a flat bottom for efficient harvesting and a shallow brine depth to improve evaporation and with the aim to allow for efficient salt harvesting using commercially proven equipment employed in Chilean operations.\n\nThe Li2CO3 recovery process from brine has been designed to achieve customer quality requirements. This system is robust and has been engineered to produce a consistent quality product regardless of seasonal changes in brine composition in the ponds.\n\nThe process removes key impurities from the concentrated brine in the ponds before producing high-purity Li2CO3 in the plant. The process uses a combination of industry standard processes that have been adjusted for the specific chemistry of the brine in the salar. These steps extract contaminants in a low-impact, cost-effective order while recovering fresh water from the brine for use in the process. The Li2CO3 precipitation is controlled carefully to form a high-purity crystal of Li2CO3 that can then be washed, dried and micronized to meet the required particle sizes from the energy storage space.\n\nThe process has been engineered to minimize the use of energy and fresh water. All brine and water used is recycled multiple times and is cleaned throughout the process. Energy is recovered internally between multiple process streams and utilities ensuring efficient and optimized consumption. This is expected to result in environmentally responsible production of high-purity lithium chemicals.\n\nOperating Costs\n\nThe operating and construction capital cost estimates have been reviewed and confirmed by Andeburg Consulting Services Inc. (“ACSI”) in accordance with NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. The Project cost estimates are based on an exchange rate of 45:1 Argentine pesos to the U.S. dollar. Despite the recent depreciation in Argentine pesos, Minera Exar does not expect a material impact to the operating and capital cost estimates as presented in U.S. dollars.\n\nThe operating cost estimates in the 40,000 tpa DFS have increased in comparison to the 25,000 tpa DFS primarily as a result of an $824/t increase in reagent costs. The increased reagent use reflects process changes designed to consistently achieve more stringent low impurity specifications of battery material customers.\n\nThe average operating costs were calculated for a facility with production of 40,000 tpa of battery-quality Li2CO3 and are presented in Table 2 below.\n\nTable 2: Caucharí-Olaroz - Operating Costs 25,000 TPA DFS40,000 TPA DFSCategoryOperating Cost\r\n ($/t Li2CO3)% of\r\nTotalOperating Cost\r\n ($/t Li2CO3)% of\r\nTotalReagents$99140%$1,81551%Pond harvesting & tailings management$34514%$36910%Maintenance$2108%$3028%Labor$1667%$2838%Electric power$1877%$2226%Natural gas$853%$1454%G&A$863%$1414%Product transportation$1707%$1274%Catering, security & third-party services$974%$612%Consumables$512%$531%Water treatment system$382%$411%Diesel$693%$17<1%Total Operating Costs$2,495100%$3,576100%\n\nCapital Costs\n\nThe total construction capital cost is estimated at $565 million inclusive of a $39 million contingency and inclusive of $105 million in capital costs incurred before June 30, 2019. Considering that the Project construction is well under way, with many key contracts and purchase orders already awarded and under execution including the process equipment, the level of confidence is expected to be approximately ±10%. Minera Exar does not expect any material impact on the capital costs as a result of the recent foreign exchange regulations and controls enacted by the Argentine Government.\n\nWith a 33% increase in capital costs from the 25,000 tpa DFS published in 2017, the 40,000 tpa DFS supports a 60% increase in production capacity. Much of the increased capital cost estimate is the result of an increase in the size of equipment, infrastructure, wells and piping without any major change in the pond layout under construction. The cost increase in the ponds corresponds to additional electromechanical work not previously included in the 25,000 tpa DFS.\n\nDetailed capital cost estimates are presented on a 100% project equity basis in Table 3 and are exclusive of value added taxes (“VAT”), other taxes, working capital and pre-production costs.\n\nTable 3: Caucharí-Olaroz – Construction Capital Costs Category25,000 TPA DFS\r\n ($ millions)(2)40,000 TPA DFS(1)(2)\r\n ($ millions)Lithium carbonate plant$122$155Evaporation ponds$129$146Infrastructure$68$96Wells and piping$15$61Indirect Cost$37$67Contingency$55$39Total Construction Capital Costs$425$565\n\n1.     Total capital costs of $565 million include $105 million of sunk capital costs as of June 30, 2019. Sunk costs are excluded from financial analysis in the DFS.\r\n2.     Totals do not add due to rounding.\n\nThe sustaining capital requirement is estimated at an average of $7.2 million per year (approximately $180/t Li2CO3 produced).\n\nProject Economics\n\nThe financial results are derived from inputs based on an annual production schedule included in the 40,000 tpa DFS as of June 30, 2019. The analysis contained in the DFS exclude $105 million in sunk capital costs as of June 30, 2019 which are included in the total construction cost estimate of $565 million.\n\nA Li2CO3 price of $8,000/t and $10,000/t is assumed for 2021 and 2022, respectively, to reflect short-term market conditions. A production ramp up schedule of 15,250 t and 36,000 t was assumed in 2021 and 2022, respectively.

(""Montgomery"") was engaged to update the Mineral Reserves in brine for various areas within the Salar de Caucharí and Salar de Olaroz in accordance with the guidelines for lithium brines set forth by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM 2012). The authors of the DFS believe the Mineral Reserve Estimate has been conservatively modeled and represents a Proven Reserve for Year 1 through 5 of full-scale extraction wellfield pumping and a Probable Reserve for Years 6 to 40 of full-scale extraction wellfield pumping.\n\nMineral Reserves for Caucharí-Olaroz have an effective date of May 7, 2019. Mineral Reserves are summarized in Table 6 and are reported on a 100% project equity basis.\n\nTable 6: Caucharí-Olaroz - Mineral Reserves Without Processing \r\nEfficiencyAssuming 53.7% Processing \r\nEfficiencyCategoryTime \r\nPeriod\r\n(years)Average\r\nLithium\r\nGrade \r\n(mg/L)Brine \r\n (m³)Lithium \r\n Metal \r\n (tonnes)LCE \r\n (tonnes)Lithium \r\n Metal \r\n (tonnes)LCE \r\n (tonnes)Proven1 - 56161.6 x 10796,650514,45051,900276,250Probable6 - 406069.6 x 108586,2703,120,590314,8301,675,770Total 406071.1 x 109682,9203,635,040366,7301,952,020\n\nNotes:\r\n1.     The Mineral Reserve Estimate has an effective date of May 7, 2019.\r\n2.     LCE is calculated using mass of LCE = 5.322785 multiplied by the mass of Lithium Metal.\r\n3.     The values in the columns for “Lithium Metal” and “LCE” above are expressed as total contained metals.\r\n4.     The Production Period is inclusive of the start of the model simulation (Year 1).\r\n5.     The average lithium concentration is weighted by per well simulated extraction rates.\r\n6.     Tonnage is rounded to the nearest 10.\r\n7.     Comparisons of values may not be equivalent due to rounding of numbers and the differences caused by use of averaging methods.\n\nMineral Resource Estimation\n\nSince the effective date of the previous Mineral Resource Estimate (February 13, 2019), the results of deeper drilling and sampling has allowed for partial conversion of the Inferred Resource aquifer volume in the updated hydrostratigraphic unit (“HSU”) model to Measured and Indicated Resource aquifer volume of the deeper HSUs. The Updated Mineral Resource Estimate at the Measured, Indicated, and Inferred Mineral Resource classification (CIM, 2014) for lithium is based on the total amount of lithium in brine that is theoretically drainable from the bulk aquifer volume.\n\nMineral Resources for Caucharí-Olaroz have an effective date of May 7, 2019.

The process’ principal source of energy is designed to be solar evaporation resulting in a low overall carbon footprint. Furthermore, process water requirements are low relative to other lithium carbonate production processes, and process water will be sourced from aquifers that that do not meet comply with drinking water standards. Minera Exar’s objective is to continue to explore ways to further reduce the Project’s environmental footprint and produce the most environmentally responsible lithium possible.\n\nEconomic & Social Benefits The DFS highlights substantial employment and economic benefits to Minera Exar’s employees, the local communities, and the provincial and federal governments. The Project is providing many jobs during construction and development and is expected to provide new long-term opportunities as the Project continues to grow.\n\nEconomic benefits and expanded of Caucharí-Olaroz Project include (based on 40,000 tpa DFS and $12,000/t Li2CO3 long-term):\n\nIncrease in federal and provincial taxes – total of $4.2 billion for life of mine (or $114 million per year)Increase in royalty and mining duty payments Increase in employment taxesExtending the current employment opportunities with over 700 Minera Exar employees and contractorsExtending the relationships with the local communities with at least a 40 year project life\n\nLiquidity\n\nAs of June 30, 2019, $460 million of the $565 million total construction capital costs was remaining. A further $100 million in expected taxes and refundable VAT is required prior to production. Minera Exar expects to fund the remaining costs to production with capital contributions and loans from Lithium Americas and Ganfeng Lithium and $195 million in capital on Minera Exar’s balance sheet which include the net proceeds from the $160 million Project investment by Ganfeng Lithium. Lithium Americas 50% share of all additional funding required up to the start of production, including working capital, is expected to be fully-funded with $221 million in available credit and loan facilities.\n\nTimeline\n\nThe Caucharí-Olaroz construction timetable is targeted to follow:\n\nQ1 2018 – Construction commenced on first evaporation pondsQ4 2018 – Began filling first evaporation pond with brineQ2 2019 – Commenced civil works and building erection for lithium carbonate plantQ4 2019 – Process equipment arrival to site commencesQ2 2020 – Complete pond construction & liming process at the ponds commencesQ3 2020 – Complete production wellfieldQ4 2020 – Lithium carbonate plant mechanical completionEarly 2021 - Commissioning and first production2022 – Full 40,000 tpa production rate achieved\n\nReport Filing\n\nThe Company plans to file an NI 43-101 compliant technical report that summarizes the DFS on SEDAR and on the Company’s website within 45 days.\n\nQualified Persons\n\nThe DFS was prepared in accordance with NI 43‐101 standards by Montgomery, Ausenco and ACSI in conjunction with a team of globally recognized consultants.

We look forward to engaging with potential strategic partners in the year to come.”\n\nRegulatory & Permitting\n\nFederal National Environmental Policy Act \r\nLithium Nevada has submitted environmental baseline studies that inform the public agencies about the Project and related resources. The final Plan of Operation (“Final PoO”) was filed in August 2019 and deemed complete by the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) in September 2019. A third-party contractor has been selected by the BLM to write the Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) which is scheduled to be complete by the end of 2019. The EIS will assist federal, state and local regulatory agencies in their review of the Company’s applications for environmental and land-use permits. Upon completion of the EIS, the BLM is expected to issue a Notice of Intent that commences the formal National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) EIS public process. The NEPA process is designed to help public officials complete permitting decisions that are protective of the environment and includes a public engagement process. Following the completion of a public process that is mandated to take no longer than twelve months, the BLM is expected to issue a Record of Decision (“ROD”). The Company’s engagement with government and Tribal stakeholders is planned to continue over the next year in anticipation of the ROD being issued in Q4 2020. The ROD will include the agency’s decision, alternatives considered and the plans for mitigation and monitoring, if necessary. The anticipated timing of key permitting milestones is highlighted in Figure 1.\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c7fe7ed1-7992-4805-a7d4-8f73e0bd4e1c\n\nPlan of Exploration \r\nEffective as of August 1 2018, the Company updated the Measured and Indicated mineral resource at Thacker Pass to 6.0 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (“LCE”) at 2,917 parts per million lithium (“ppm Li”) (Measured 2.4 million tonnes at 2,948 ppm Li and Indicated 1.4 million tonnes 2,864 ppm Li, respectively) and the Inferred mineral resource to approximately 2.3 million tonnes of LCE at 2,932 ppm Li. Additional exploration targets have been identified outside the existing resource boundary. Prompted by the discovery of lithium mineralization in the Southwest Basin in 2017, Lithium Nevada has submitted permit applications for a proposed future exploration program in the southern and eastern areas of Thacker Pass as identified in Figure 2.\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/e1f26ac9-c159-4424-8edc-d6162cd0b86a\n\nWater Rights Lithium Nevada has secured water rights that it believes will be sufficient to meet or exceed requirements for Phase 1 production. Use of the water rights will be subject to customary regulatory approvals including the transfer of the point of diversion, point of use and manner of use prior to production.\n\nCommercial Agreements\n\nNorth American Coal\r\nLithium Nevada and Sawtooth Mining LLC (“Sawtooth Mining”) executed a long-term contract mining agreement (the “Mining Agreement”). Under the Mining Agreement, Sawtooth Mining will act as Lithium Nevada’s contract miner for Thacker Pass. By engaging with Sawtooth Mining and The North American Coal Corporation (“North American Coal”) during project development, Thacker Pass will be able to leverage over 100 years of sedimentary mining experience and one of the best safety records in the industry, which may help to further de-risk Project execution.\n\nSawtooth Mining has exclusive responsibility for the design, construction, operation, maintenance and all mining and mine closure services of the Thacker Pass surface mine which will supply all of Lithium Nevada’s lithium-bearing ore requirements. North American Coal, through its many subsidiaries, operates nine surface coal mines and provides services at twenty aggregates quarries in the United States, with annual total deliveries exceeding 70 million tonnes in 2018.\n\nThe Mining Agreement is effective immediately and Sawtooth Mining will play an active role assisting Lithium Nevada with Thacker Pass’ permitting and development. In addition, Sawtooth Mining will provide Lithium Nevada i) US$3.5 million (of which, US$1 million has already been received) and ii) engineering services related primarily to mine design and permitting. During construction, Sawtooth Mining has agreed to fund up to US$50 million to procure all mobile mining equipment required for Phase 1 operations. Excluding these Sawtooth Mining investments, Lithium Nevada bears all costs of mining and mine closure.\n\nTIC-The Industrial Company\r\nLithium Nevada has also entered into a design and build contract with TIC-The Industrial Company (“TIC”) a division of Kiewit Corporation (“Kiewit”), who has responsibility for the overall cost estimate in the definitive feasibility study as well as engineering design of plant, water supply infrastructure, electrical infrastructure, and general site works. Under the agreement, Lithium Nevada has the option to expand the agreement to include TIC as the prime contractor for construction of the plant. TIC and Kiewit have extensive experience building mines and processing facilities in Nevada and has access to an experienced workforce of over 20,000 employees.\n\nProcess Engineering & Design\n\nProcess Testing Facility The Thacker Pass process optimizes and reconfigures several commercially-proven techniques in extractive metallurgy designed specifically for the processing of lithium bearing clays. To date, Lithium Nevada’s process testing facility located in Reno, Nevada has produced over 3,000 kg of high-quality lithium sulfate brine (“lithium sulfate”) from Thacker Pass ore. The process has been optimized by upgrading the ore through a wet attrition process followed by a hydrocyclone to remove coarse material with relatively low lithium content. The process test work has demonstrated an increase in lithium concentration by over 25% which results in reduced acid consumption per tonne of LCE.\n\nIn addition to optimizing acid consumption, the process testing facility has also generated tailings samples that are being used for stability and geochemical analysis, as well as feed samples to crystallizer vendors who will design the equipment and provide performance guarantees.\n\nFigure 3 shows the high-grade lithium slurry at Lithium Nevada’s process testing facility located in Reno, Nevada.\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/cfb7d107-b4a3-4879-b335-c09ed6171de2\n\nCrystallizer Vendors\r\nExperienced crystallization vendors have been engaged to develop the design and cost estimate for process equipment to manufacture high-purity battery-quality lithium products from lithium sulfate, including lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide.  A vendor has agreed to produce high-purity samples of lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide from lithium sulfate produced at the process testing facility in Reno, Nevada. Lithium Nevada expects to send samples of Thacker Pass’ lithium products to potential customers and partners to confirm quality specifications.\n\nPatent Application A patent application has been submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office to protect fundamental aspects of Lithium Nevada’s proprietary lithium extraction technology, which includes elements from the attrition process through to crystallization.\n\nEnvironmental & Social Responsibility\n\nEnvironmental Responsibility\r\nLithium Nevada’s objective is to produce the most environmentally responsible lithium products. The nature of the deposit combined with the simple processing flowsheet and advanced pollution control technologies are expected to result in low water and energy requirements and minimal greenhouse gas emissions. The cogeneration facility produces a significant amount of carbon-free electricity that will be used to power the processing facilities. As a result, Lithium Nevada may be in a position to produce the first and only carbon-neutral lithium products.\n\nGreat Basin Sagebrush Restoration Fund\r\nConsistent with the Company’s focus on environmental sustainability, Lithium Nevada and the University of Nevada, Reno Foundation (“UNR Foundation”) founded the Great Basin Sagebrush Restoration Fund (the “Fund”) in 2017. The Fund’s mission is to improve sagebrush habitat through cost-effective habitat rehabilitation methods. The research has produced numerous successes in seed enhancement technology, precision rehabilitation and genetics. The rehabilitation tools developed by the Fund have been recently deployed to assist a federal agency with the rehabilitation of federal lands impacted by recent large wildfires in Nevada. Several major mining companies and the BLM have recently made funding commitments, and the Fund is currently the largest sagebrush restoration fund in the United States.\n\nCommunity Relations\r\nLithium Nevada is committed to being a good neighbor and has developed a community engagement strategy based on transparency, early engagement and frequent communication. Open houses have been held in Winnemucca and Orovada to communicate progress of Thacker Pass and collect feedback. Lithium Nevada is engaged with the local McDermitt Tribal government and has made commitments to provide skills training, jobs and economic opportunities.

"2019-06-06T11:30:00+00:00","Lithium Americas Provides Update on the Project Investment by Ganfeng Lithium","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, June  06, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC) (""Lithium Americas"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to provide an update on the transaction announced April 1, 2019, whereby Ganfeng Lithium Co. Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries, “Ganfeng Lithium”) has agreed to subscribe, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, for newly issued shares of Minera Exar S.A. (“Minera Exar”), the holding company for the Caucharí-Olaroz lithium brine project (the “Project” or “Caucharí-Olaroz) for cash consideration of US$160 million (such transaction, the “Project Investment”).\n\nTransaction Update\n\nSince announcement of the Project Investment, Lithium Americas and Ganfeng Lithium have been working diligently to satisfy the necessary conditions to closing and the Company is pleased to provide the following updates:\n\nGanfeng Lithium Regulatory Approvals – the Company has been advised by Ganfeng Lithium that it has received all required regulatory approvals for closing the Project Investment.Credit Agreement Consent – BCP Innovation Pte Ltd. (“Bangchak”), as one of the Company’s senior lenders under its 2017 credit agreement, have provided their consent to the Project Investment. In consideration for providing its consent, in the event the Company approves an expansion of the stated production capacity of the Project from its current targeted production of 25,000 tonnes per annum (“tpa”) to 40,000 tpa, the Company will be obligated to provide incremental off-take rights in favour of Bangchak to acquire up to an additional 3,500 tpa of lithium carbonate at market prices.Shareholder Approval – shareholders of the Company and Ganfeng Lithium will be asked to approve the Project Investment at each company’s shareholder meetings, scheduled to be held on June 26 (Lithium Americas) and June 11 (Ganfeng Lithium).\n\nIn addition to shareholder approval, the Project Investment remains subject to satisfaction of a number of conditions precedent, including execution of an amended and restated shareholders agreement for Minera Exar, and is expected to close by early Q3 2019.\n\nUpon closing of the Project Investment, Ganfeng Lithium will acquire approximately 141 million newly issued shares in Minera Exar, which will increase its interest in Caucharí-Olaroz from 37.5% to 50%, with Lithium Americas holding the remaining 50% interest (each subject to the rights of JEMSE (the Government of Jujuy) to acquire an approximate 8.5% interest in Minera Exar).\n\nAnnual General Meeting\n\nLithium Americas annual general meeting of shareholders is scheduled to be held at 1:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) on June 26, 2019 at the offices of Cassels Brock & Blackwell LLP, Suite 2200, 885 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, BC V6C 3E8 (the “Meeting”).\n\nManagement’s Information Circular for the Meeting has been filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com, on EDGAR and is also available through the Company’s website www.lithiumamericas.com. The Circular contains additional information regarding the Project Investment, as well as information relating to annual business to be conducted at the Meeting, such as appointment of the Company’s director nominees. All shareholders are encouraged to vote at the Meeting. Details on how to vote are contained in the Information Circular.\n\nShareholder Information and Questions\n\nLithium Americas shareholders who have questions about the Meeting, the Project Investment or need assistance with voting can contact our proxy solicitation agent, Laurel Hill Advisory Group:\n\nLaurel Hill Advisory Group\r\nNorth American Toll Free: 1 877 452 7184\r\nCollect Calls Outside North America: 1 416 304 0211\r\nEmail: assistance@laurelhill.com\n\nBangchak Consent\n\nAs described above, Bangchak has provided its consent to the Project Investment. In consideration for providing the Bangchak consent, the Company has agreed that if an expansion of the stated production capacity of the Project from 25,000 tpa to 40,000 tpa is approved, the Company will be obligated to provide incremental off-take rights in favour of Bangchak to acquire up to an additional 3,500 tpa of lithium carbonate, up at an aggregate maximum of 6,000 tpa of lithium carbonate (at a 40,000 tpa project capacity) at market prices. The consent is conditional upon entry into an amended off-take agreement with Bangchak concurrently with the closing of the Project Investment. Ganfeng Lithium, as the Company’s other senior lender, has already consented to the Project Investment. In addition, the consent includes a commitment from Bangchak to provide up to US$50 million of additional debt financing on substantially the same terms as the Company’s existing senior debt facility, however, with the proceeds of such financing available for a broader purpose. Should the Company elect to pursue this additional debt financing in the future, such financing will be subject to negotiation of definitive documentation and consent of the Company’s other lender, Ganfeng Lithium, under its senior credit and subordinated loan agreements. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to realize on such additional debt financing, including the terms and timing thereof.\n\nReceipt of Bangchak’s consent to the Project Investment for the consideration described above constitutes a “related party transaction” within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”) because Bangchak and its affiliates are significant shareholders (approx. 15.8%) of Lithium Americas. Consequently, the Project Investment is subject to the formal valuation and minority approval requirements set forth in MI 61-101.\n\nMI 61-101 provides that where an issuer borrows from a related party or sells, transfers or disposes of an asset to a related party, those transactions may be considered “related party transactions” for the purposes of MI 61-101. The potential transactions related to Bangchak’s consent, being a 3,500 tpa increase in off-take committed from the Company to Bangchak and an increased US$50 million loan commitment from Bangchak to the Company, do not attract, or are exempt from, the formal valuation or minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101. In the case of increased borrowing, a formal valuation is not required as that transaction is not the type of related party transaction that requires a formal valuation. In the case of the increased loan commitment, it is expected that any potential increase would be made available on terms consistent with the Credit Agreement and that any such borrowings would be on reasonable commercial terms that are not less advantageous to Lithium Americas than if the loan were obtained from an arms’ length party. In addition, the loan would have no equity component. As a result, any such credit increase from Bangchak would be exempt from the minority shareholder approval requirements on the basis of the exemption set out in Section 5.7(1)(f) of MI 61-101. In the case of any potential increase in lithium off-take to Bangchak, as the terms of the off-take provide for sales to be completed at market pricing at the time of any actual sale, it has been determined that any such off-take increase would not be subject to either the formal valuation or minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 on the basis of the exemptions in Sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(a) of MI 61-101, being that the fair market value of the consideration for or the transaction would not exceed 25% of Lithium America’s market capitalization (calculated in accordance with MI 61-101).\n\nAbout Lithium Americas:\n\nLithium Americas owns a 62.5% interest in Caucharí-Olaroz along with its partner, Ganfeng Lithium.  As a result of the Project Investment, Ganfeng Lithium will increase its interest in Caucharí-Olaroz from 37.5% to 50%, with Lithium Americas holding the remaining 50% interest. In addition, Lithium Americas owns 100% of the Thacker Pass lithium project located in Nevada, the largest known lithium deposit in the United States. The Company trades on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol “LAC”.\n\nFor further information contact:\n\nLithium Americas Corp.\r\nInvestor Relations\r\nSuite 300 – 900 West Hastings Street\r\nVancouver, BC, V6C 1E6\r\nTelephone: 778-656-5820\r\nEmail:    ir@lithiumamericas.com\r\nWebsite: www.lithiumamericas.com\n\nForward-Looking Statements & Information\n\nThis news release contains “forward-looking information” and “forward-looking statements” (which we refer to collectively as forward-looking information) under the provisions of applicable securities legislation.

"2019-05-15T11:59:00+00:00","Lithium Americas Reports Q1 2019 Financial and Operating Results","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May  15, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC) (""Lithium Americas"" or the ""Company"") has announced its financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2019.\n\nThis news release should be read in conjunction with Lithium Americas’ unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and management's discussion and analysis (""MD&A"") for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which are available on Lithium Americas’ website and SEDAR.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nCauchari-Olaroz:\n\nOn April 1, 2019 the Company entered into a definitive transaction agreement whereby Ganfeng Lithium Co., Ltd. (“Ganfeng”) has agreed to subscribe, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, for 141 million newly issued shares of Minera Exar, for cash consideration of US$160 million (such transaction, the “Project Investment”). On closing of the Project Investment, Ganfeng will increase its direct interest in the Cauchari-Olaroz project from 37.5% to 50%, with Lithium Americas holding the remaining 50% interest (each subject to the rights of JEMSE (the Government of Jujuy) to acquire an approximate 8.5% interest in Minera Exar).\n\nLithium Americas and Ganfeng have agreed to implement certain amendments to the Shareholders Agreement governing the Minera Exar joint venture, including the provision of equal representation on the Minera Exar board of directors and the Management Committee governing the joint venture. In addition, on closing of the Project Investment, Minera Exar is expected to repay an $8 million loan, together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon, that was previously advanced by the Company in order to provide interim funding used for the construction and development of Caucharí-Olaroz during the closing of the 2018 transactions between Lithium Americas and Ganfeng.\n\nThe Project Investment constitutes a related party transaction. Closing of the Project Investment remains subject to Ganfeng shareholder and regulatory approvals, the consent of BCP Innovation Pte. Ltd. in its capacity as lender pursuant to the Company’s senior credit facility, the Company’s shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions.\n\nLithium Americas and Ganfeng continue to actively work with Minera Exar to advance construction, procurement and engineering at Cauchari-Olaroz with the goal of producing the highest quality battery grade lithium carbonate for the lowest cost.  Minera Exar is undertaking a feasibility study in respect of an increase in the stated production capacity of the Cauchari-Olaroz project from 25,000 tonnes per annum (“tpa”) to an aggregate of 40,000 tpa of lithium carbonate, as well as to advance certain permitting, design and other development planning activities at Cauchari-Olaroz.\n\nDevelopment activities are on schedule with the advancement of detailed engineering, ponds construction, production wells drilling, camp construction, plant design and equipment procurement to support the start of production in the second half of 2020. Two evaporation ponds are completed, one pond is filled with brine and subsequent to the quarter end Minera Exar started filling the second pond and the third, partially completed, pond. Nine ponds are at various stages of construction. A total of seven wells are currently pumping brine to the ponds and three more wells are under construction. Requests for quotations for most of the long lead equipment items are under evaluation. The first plant construction package was awarded and the contractor mobilized to perform the work. A total of $73 million was advanced to Minera Exar in 2019 year to date (including $45.6 million by the Company) in the form of loans to fund the construction. As of the current date, 520 people are working at the site, 178 are Minera Exar employees and 342 are contractors. Current camp capacity at the site accommodates 554 people and an additional 128 beds will be added in 2019 in preparation for construction activities in addition to the operations camp capacity that will follow. Initial Stage 1 capital cost estimate of $425 million, on a 100% basis and before value-added taxes (“VAT”), remains unchanged. The Company increased the Measured and Indicated mineral resource at its Cauchari-Olaroz project by 53% to 17.9 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (“LCE”) at 581 mg/L average grade and the Inferred mineral resource to 5.1 million tonnes of LCE at 602 mg/L. The updated Measured and Indicated mineral resource has not been used to update the assumptions in the Company’s detailed feasibility study, see discussion below.\n\nLithium Nevada:\n\nThe permitting process for Thacker Pass is underway, with environmental baseline data collection complete and a conceptual Mine Plan of Operations (“MPO”) submitted to the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”).  A final MPO is forecasted to be submitted to the BLM in the second half of 2019. A process testing facility has been constructed and commissioned in Reno, Nevada to optimize the process (predominantly to reduce the consumption of sulfuric acid), prepare tailings samples for stability and geochemical analysis and to provide feed samples to vendors who will design the equipment and provide performance guarantees. The Company is considering the production of lithium hydroxide directly from lithium sulfate to provide added flexibility to market demand. The Company intends to prepare a NI 43-101 compliant definitive feasibility study detailing the status of the permitting process and outcomes of the 2018 exploration program and process testing facility testing in due course, along with other applicable updates. The Company is evaluating potential partnership and financing scenarios for Thacker Pass.\n\nRheoMinerals:\n\nRheoMinerals’ sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $1.3 million (2018 – $1.1 million). As a result of lower than expected sales, in Q4 2018 the Company recognized an $11.58 million impairment of Organoclay property, plant and equipment. In April, 2019, the Company reviewed RheoMinerals’ business plan and implemented cost-reducing measures with the aim to make the business profitable.\n\nFinance:\n\nAs at March 31, 2019, the Company had $36.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has a $205 million credit facility to finance its share of capital expenditures in Minera Exar. Since the inception of the credit facility, the Company has drawn $63.1 million ($17.5 million of which was drawn in 2018, $37.5 million in Q1, 2019 and $8.1 million subsequently to Q1 2019). As part of the Transaction, Ganfeng also provided LAC an additional $100 million unsecured, limited recourse, subordinated loan facility, which is undrawn at the date of this MD&A, increasing LAC’s overall credit availability to $241.9 million (net of drawdowns to date). The proceeds of the subordinated loan facility are available to the Company to be used for general corporate purposes.\n\nCorporate:\n\nTom Hodgson has retired as Chief Executive Officer and as a director of the Company, effective May 15, 2019. The Board of Directors has appointed Jonathan (Jon) Evans, currently President and Chief Operating Officer, to the role of President and Chief Executive Officer and to replace Mr. Hodgson on the Board. Mr. Hodgson has agreed to stay on as a consultant to assist with the transition and will continue to support the Company as needed.\n\nUpdated Cauchari-Olaroz Mineral Resource\n\nOn April 1, 2019, the Company published the technical report dated March 31, 2019, with an effective date of March 1, 2019, entitled “NI 43-101 Technical Report Updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Cauchari-Olaroz Project, Jujuy Province, Argentina” (“Cauchari TR”). Included in the Cauchari TR is an updated Mineral Resource estimate for the Cauchari-Olaroz Project as summarized in the table below, reported on a 100% project equity basis. LAC no longer reports a potassium Mineral Resource on the project.\n\nMineral Resources\n\nThe Mineral Resource estimate below is expressed relative to a lithium grade cut-off of greater than or equal to 300 mg/L.\n\nUpdated Mineral Resource Estimate for Lithium at the Cauchari-Olaroz project CategoryAverage \r\n Lithium \r\n Grade \r\n (mg/L)Brine \r\n (m3)Lithium \r\n MetalLCE \r\n (tonnes)Measured 587 1.11E+09  651,100 3,465,700Indicated 580 4.70E+09  2,726,300 14,511,500Measured + Indicated 581 5.81E+09  3,377,400 17,977,200Inferred 602 1.59E+09  957,400 5,096,000\n\nNotes:\n\n(1) The Mineral Resource estimate has an effective date of February 13, 2019.\r\n(2) Mineral Resources have a cut-off grade of 300 mg/L of lithium.\r\n(3) Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the Mineral Resource will be converted to Mineral Reserves.\r\n(4) LCE is calculated based on the following conversion factor: mass of LCE = 5.322785 x mass of lithium metal.\n\nThe updated resource provided above constitutes a change of -1% for total average lithium concentration of Measured + Indicated (585 mg/L vs. 581mg/L) and a change of +53% for total LCE Measured + Indicated (11,752,000 tonnes LCE vs. 17,977,200 tonnes LCE). The increase in overall mass can be attributed to the expansion and deepening of the Resource Evaluation Area based on exploration results obtained in 2017 and 2018. The decline in total average concentration can be attributed to the updated Resource estimate affected by the 2017 and 2018 range of samples collected in SdO and Archibarca areas of the Cauchari-Olaroz Project. When spatially averaged with the lithium concentration of SdC samples, which essentially dominated the prior estimate, the updated estimate has a relatively small percentage decrease in the overall concentration of lithium.\n\nTechnical Information\n\nDetailed scientific and technical information on the Cauchari-Olaroz Project can be found in the Cauchari TR that was filed with the securities regulatory authorities in each of the provinces of Canada on March 31, 2019. The Cauchari TR has an effective date of March 1, 2019 and was prepared by Ernest Burga, P.Eng., David Burga, P.Geo., Wayne Genck, P.Eng. and Daniel Weber, P.G., RM-SME, each of whom is a “qualified person” for the purposes of NI 43-101.\n\nFinancial Results:\n\nThe following selected financial information is presented in thousands of US dollars, shares and other equity instruments in thousands, unless otherwise stated and except in relation to per share amounts.\n\nThe following table summarises the items that resulted in the increase in net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2019 (Q1 2019) versus the three months ended March 31, 2018 (Q1 2018), as well as certain offsetting items:\n\nFinancial results Period ended March 31, Change  2019 2018  $ $ $ Organoclay sales  1,280  1,096  184 Cost of sales  (1,469) (1,677) 208 Exploration expenditures  (1,181) (1,400) 219 Organoclay research and development  (112) (133) 21 General and administrative expenses  (1,910) (2,017) 107 Share of gain/(loss) in Joint Venture  1,384  (164) 1,548 Stock-based compensation  (624) (1,945) 1,321 Transaction costs  (757) -  (757)Foreign exchange (loss)/gain  (896) 1,369  (2,265)Finance costs  (640) -  (640)Other income  457  304  153 Net Loss  (4,468) (4,567) 99\n\nNet loss for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $4,468 compared to $4,567 for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The slight decrease in the net loss was mainly attributable to a share of gain (versus loss in Q1 2018) in Joint Venture and a decrease in stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in the foreign exchange loss, transaction costs and finance costs.\n\nOrganoclay Sales and Cost of Sales\n\nThe organoclay sales in Q1 2019 were $1,280 (Q1 2018 - $1,096), with related production costs of $1,315 (Q1 2018 - $1,496) and depreciation expense of $154 (Q1 2018 - $181) resulting in gross loss of $189 (Q1 2018 - $581).\n\nExpenses\n\nExploration expenditures in Q1 2019 of $1,181 (Q1 2018 – $1,400) include expenditures incurred for the Thacker Pass project. The decrease in the Company’s exploration expenditures is mostly due to the timing and scheduling of expenditures on the Thacker Pass project.\n\nGain from the Joint Venture in Q1 2019 of $1,384 (Q1 2018 – loss of $164) mainly represents the Company’s share of the Exar Capital BV Joint Venture interest income on the loans to Minera Exar for the Cauchari-Olaroz project.\n\nStock-based compensation in Q1 2019 of $624 (Q1 2018 - $1,945) is a non-cash expense and consists of the $209 (Q1 2018 - $1,513) estimated fair value of stock options, the $98 (Q1 2018 - $432) fair market value of RSUs, and the $317 (Q1 2018 – nil) fair value of PSUs vested during the period. In Q1 2019 the Company granted 39 DSUs to its directors. Higher stock-based compensation during Q1 2018 was mainly due to the timing of the new stock option grants and RSU awards to the Company’s employees and officers.\n\nIncluded in General and Administrative expenses in Q1 2019 of $1,910 (Q1 2018 - $2,017) are:\n\nOffice and administrative expenses of $303 (Q1 2018 - $327) include insurance, IT, telephone, and other related expenses and RheoMinerals’ general office expenses. Professional fees of $241 (Q1 2018 - $325) consist mainly of legal fees of $73 (Q1 2018 – $144), consulting fees of $92 (Q1 2018 - $114) and accounting fees of $76 (Q1 2018 - $39). The decrease is due to the costs of listing the Company on the NYSE in Q1 2018. Salaries and benefits of $853 (Q1 2018 - $771) include compensation to the Company’s employees and directors’ fees. The increase in salaries and benefits is mainly due to the new hires. Regulatory and filing fees were $112 (Q1 2018 - $175). The decrease is due to the costs of listing the Company on the NYSE in Q1 2018.\n\nOther Items\n\nThe Company recognized in Q1 2019 a foreign exchange loss of $896 (Q1 2018 – gain of $1,369). The loss was due to the weakening of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar. The Company holds most of its cash in US currency.\n\nOther income in Q1 2019 was $457 (Q1 2018 - $304) and includes interest income earned on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and a $150 progress payment received by RheoMinerals from Delmon.\n\nQualified Person:\n\nThe scientific and technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Dr. Rene LeBlanc, a Qualified Person for purposes of NI 43-101 by virtue of his experience, education and professional association.  Mr. LeBlanc is the Chief Technical Officer of the Company.

"2019-04-01T11:47:00+00:00","Lithium Americas Reports 2018 Financial and Operating Results","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April  01, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC) (""Lithium Americas"" or the ""Company"") has announced its financial and operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nThis news release should be read in conjunction with Lithium Americas’ audited consolidated financial statements and management's discussion and analysis (""MD&A"") for the year ended December 31, 2018, which are available on Lithium Americas’ website and SEDAR.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nCauchari-Olaroz:\n\nOn April 1, 2019 the Company entered into a definitive transaction agreement whereby Ganfeng Lithium Co., Ltd. (“Ganfeng”) has agreed to subscribe, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, for 141 million newly issued shares of Minera Exar S.A. (“Minera Exar”), the holding company for the Cauchari-Olaroz lithium brine project, for cash consideration of US$160 million (such transaction, the “Project Investment”). As a result of the Project Investment, Ganfeng will increase its direct and indirect interest in the Cauchari-Olaroz project from 37.5% to 50%, with Lithium Americas holding the remaining 50% interest (each subject to the rights of JEMSE (the Government of Jujuy) to acquire an approximate 8.5% interest in Minera Exar). Closing of the transaction remains subject to Ganfeng shareholder and regulatory approvals, the consent of BCP Innovation Pte. Ltd. in its capacity as lender pursuant to the Company’s senior credit facility, the Company’s shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions.\n\nConcurrently herewith, the Company updated the Measured and Indicated mineral resource at its Cauchari-Olaroz project to 17.9 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (“LCE”) at 581 mg/L average grade and the Inferred mineral resource to 5.1 million tonnes of LCE at 602 mg/L. The updated Measured and Indicated mineral resource has not been used to update the assumptions in the Company’s detailed feasibility study, see discussion below.\n\nThe updated NI 43-101 resource report discloses an approximate 53% increase in the Measured and Indicated mineral resource from the Company’s 2018 resource estimate and establishes Cauchari-Olaroz as the second largest known brine lithium resource in the world as of the date hereof.\n\nOn October 31, 2018, the Company completed a series of transactions (the “Transaction”) pursuant to which Lithium Americas increased its interest in Minera Exar from 50% to 62.5% and Ganfeng acquired the remaining 37.5% interest.\n\nLithium Americas and Ganfeng continue to work with Minera Exar to optimize its Cauchari-Olaroz project (the “Project”) with the goal of producing the highest quality battery grade lithium carbonate for the lowest cost.  Minera Exar is undertaking a feasibility study in respect of an increase in the stated production capacity of the Project from 25,000 tpa to an aggregate of 40,000 tpa of lithium carbonate, as well as to advance certain permitting, design and other development planning activities at Cauchari-Olaroz.\n\nDevelopment activities are continued on schedule with the advancement of engineering and construction, including the following:\n\nTwo evaporation ponds are completed and an additional four ponds are under construction. The filling of the first pond with brine commenced in October 2018. A total of seven wells are currently pumping brine to the ponds and three more wells are under construction. Filling of the second pond is expected to start in April 2019. Engineering is continuing and is on track to support the procurement and construction activities. Requests for quotations for most of the long lead equipment items were issued and firm proposals are under evaluation. The first plant construction package was awarded and the contractor mobilized to perform the work. Procurement is advancing on schedule for equipment related to pond operations. A total of US$57 million was advanced to Minera Exar in 2018 (including US$34 million by the Company) in the form of equity contributions and loans to fund the construction. An additional US$60 million was advanced to Minera Exar subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2018 (including US$37.5 million by the Company). Minera Exar has increased the size of its team to support operations and construction activities. There are currently more than 200 full-time Minera Exar employees. Currently 476 people are working at the site, 172 are Minera Exar employees and 304 are contractors. Current camp capacity at the site accommodates 554 people and an additional 128 beds will be added in early 2019 in preparation for construction activities. Initial Stage 1 capital cost estimate of US$425 million, on a 100% basis and before value-added taxes (“VAT”), remains unchanged. Construction continued in accordance with the schedule despite a heavier than usual rain season in the region in February 2019. Dilution to the ponds is not expected to have a major impact at this stage of the project.\n\nLithium Nevada:\n\nOn August 2, 2018, the Company filed the preliminary feasibility study (“PFS”) for the Thacker Pass lithium project (“Thacker Pass”). Water rights were secured during 2018 and are expected to be sufficient for all of Phase 1 production and a portion of Phase 2 (as defined in the PFS). These water rights will be subject to a prescribed regulatory process to transfer the point of the diversion and manner of use prior to the start of production. The permitting process for Thacker Pass is underway, with environmental baseline data collection complete and a conceptual Mine Plan of Operations submitted to the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”). An exploration program was completed in 2018 and included new surface geological mapping, expansion drilling at the proposed pit area and exploration of new target areas. A pilot plant and laboratory has been constructed and commissioned in Reno, Nevada to optimize the process (predominantly to reduce the consumption of sulfuric acid), prepare tailings samples for stability and geochemical analysis and to provide feed samples to vendors who will design the equipment and provide performance guarantees.  The Company is considering the production of lithium hydroxide directly from lithium sulfate to provide added flexibility to market demand. The Company intends to prepare a NI 43-101 compliant feasibility study detailing the status of the permitting process and outcomes of the 2018 exploration program and pilot plant testing in due course, along with other applicable updates (such as the permitting process). The Company is evaluating potential partnership and financing scenarios for Thacker Pass.\n\nRheoMinerals:\n\nThe sales of RheoMinerals for the year ended December 31, 2018 were US$4.8 million (2017 – US$4.3 million). Sales for the three months ended December 31, 2018 were US$1.5 million (2017 - US$0.5 million). As a result of lower than expected sales, the Company recognized US$11.6 million impairment of Organoclay property, plant and equipment. The Company is reviewing RheoMinerals’ business plan with the aim to make the business profitable.\n\nFinance:\n\nAs at December 31, 2018, the Company had US$41.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. As part of the Transaction, Minera Exar repaid US$25 million of its outstanding indebtedness to the Company. The Company has a US$205 million credit facility to finance its share of capital expenditures in Minera Exar. Since the start of 2018, the Company has drawn US$55 million under this credit facility (US$17.5 million of which was drawn in 2018). As part of the Transaction, Ganfeng also provided LAC an additional US$100 million unsecured, limited recourse, subordinated loan facility, which is undrawn at the date of this news release, increasing LAC’s overall credit availability to US$250 million (excluding drawdowns to date).\n\nCorporate:\n\nIn August 2018, the Company appointed Mr. Jonathan (Jon) Evans as President and Chief Operating Officer. Jon brings over 20 years of executive operations experience to his new role, including five years as a general manager of the Lithium Division at FMC Corp. Due to the executive appointment, Jon resigned as a director of Lithium Americas.\n\nUpdated Cauchari-Olaroz Mineral Resource\n\nOn April 1, 2019, the Company published the technical report dated March 31, 2019, with an effective date of March 1, 2019, entitled “NI 43-101 Technical Report Updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Cauchari-Olaroz Project, Jujuy Province, Argentina” (“Cauchari TR”). Included in the Cauchari TR is an updated Mineral Resource estimate for the Cauchari-Olaroz Project as summarized in the table below, reported on a 100% project equity basis. LAC no longer reports a potassium Mineral Resource on the project.\n\nMineral Resources\n\nThe Mineral Resource estimate below is expressed relative to a lithium grade cut-off of greater than or equal to 300 mg/L.\n\nUpdated Mineral Resource Estimate for Lithium CategoryAverage \r\n Lithium \r\n Grade \r\n (mg/L)  Brine\r\n (m3)Lithium \r\n MetalLCE \r\n (tonnes) Measured 587  1.11E+09 651,100 3,465,700Indicated 580  4.70E+09 2,726,300 14,511,500Measured + Indicated 581  5.81E+09 3,377,400 17,977,200Inferred 602  1.59E+09 957,400 5,096,000Notes:(1)  The Mineral Resource estimate has an effective date of February 13, 2019.(2)  Mineral Resources have a cut-off grade of 300 mg/L of lithium.(3)  Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the Mineral Resource will be converted to Mineral Reserves.(4)  LCE is calculated based on the following conversion factor: mass of LCE = 5.322785 x mass of lithium metal.\n\nThe updated resource provided above constitutes a change of -1% for total average lithium concentration of Measured + Indicated (585 mg/L vs. 581mg/L) and a change of +53% for total LCE Measured + Indicated (11,752,000 tonnes LCE vs. 17,977,200 tonnes LCE). The increase in overall mass can be attributed to the expansion and deepening of the Resource Evaluation Area based on exploration results obtained in 2017 and 2018. The decline in total average concentration can be attributed to the updated Resource estimate affected by the 2017 and 2018 range of samples collected in SdO and Archibarca areas of the Cauchari-Olaroz Project. When spatially averaged with the lithium concentration of SdC samples, which essentially dominated the prior estimate, the updated estimate has a relatively small percentage decrease in the overall concentration of lithium.\n\nTechnical Information\n\nDetailed scientific and technical information on the Cauchari-Olaroz Project can be found in the Cauchari TR that was filed with the securities regulatory authorities in each of the provinces of Canada on March 31, 2019. The Cauchari TR has an effective date of March 1, 2019 and was prepared by Ernest Burga, P.Eng., David Burga, P.Geo., Wayne Genck, P.Eng. and Daniel Weber, P.G., RM-SME, each of whom is a “qualified person” for the purposes of NI 43-101.\n\nFinancial Results:\n\nThe following selected financial information is presented in thousands of US dollars, shares and other equity instruments in thousands, unless otherwise stated and except in relation to per share amounts.\n\nThe following table summarizes the key items that resulted in the decrease in net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 versus the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as certain offsetting items:\n\nFinancial resultsYears ended December 31, Change  2018 2017  $ $ $ Organoclay sales 4.843 4.29 553 Cost of sales (6,800)(6,103)(697)Exploration expenditures (10,015)(4,339)(5,676)Organoclay research and development (578)(423)(155)General and administrative expenses (9,419)(7,296)(2,123)Share of loss in Joint Venture (347)(4,850)4.503 Stock-based compensation (4,616)(11,412)6.796 Gain on increase of interest in Joint Venture 6.104 - 6.104 Impairment of Organoclay property, plant and equipment (11,580)- (11,580)Transaction costs (974)- (974)Foreign exchange gain/(loss) 3.828 (3,759)7.587 Other income 1.287 642 645 Net Loss (28,267)(33,250)4.983\n\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $28,267 compared to $33,250 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in the net loss was mainly attributable to the one-time gain on increase of interest in Joint Venture, lower loss from the Joint Venture (as most costs were capitalized in the year ended December 31, 2018, but expensed during the first two quarters of 2017), lower stock-based compensation and higher foreign exchange gain partially offset by an impairment charge on Organoclay property, plant and equipment, transaction costs, higher exploration expenses at the Thacker Pass project and higher general and administrative expenses.\n\nOrganoclay Sales and Cost of Sales\n\nThe organoclay sales during the year ended December 31, 2018 were $4,843 (2017 - $4,290), with related production costs of $5,681 (2017 - $5,339) and depreciation expense of $1,119 (2017 - $764) resulting in gross loss of $1,957 (2017 - $1,813).\n\nExpenses\n\nExploration expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2018 of $10,015 (2017 – $4,339) increased mostly due to drilling, permitting and engineering activities at the Thacker Pass project.\n\nOrganoclay research and development costs are relatively consistent from period to period and include costs of operating the research and development team and lab for new organoclay product development.\n\nLoss from the Joint Venture during the year ended December 31, 2018 of $347 (2017 – $4,850) represents the Company’s share of the Joint Venture losses for the Cauchari-Olaroz project. In July 2017, the Joint Venture’s Cauchari-Olaroz project entered the development phase. Effective July 1, 2017, all costs directly attributable to the project are being capitalized. The Company’s share of the Joint Venture losses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period of 2017 as the majority of costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 were capitalized as project development costs.\n\nStock-based compensation during the year ended December 31, 2018 of $4,616 (2017 - $11,412) is a non-cash expense and consists of the $3,189 (2017 – $4,423) estimated fair value of stock options, the $946 (2017 – $6,989) fair market value of RSUs, and the $481 (2017 – nil) fair value of PSUs vested during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company granted 90 stock options, 246 RSUs of which 197 RSUs were granted in lieu of salaries recorded in accrued liabilities, 699 PSUs to its employees and officers and 87 DSUs to its independent directors in lieu of directors’ fees. Higher stock-based compensation in 2017 was mainly due to a one-time bonus granted to certain executives of the Company in connection with the successful completion of the Ganfeng and Bangchak financings.\n\nIncluded in General and Administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018 of $9,419 (2017 – $7,296) are:\n\nOffice and administrative expenses of $1,331 (2017 – $743) include Vancouver, Reno, and Toronto office rent, insurance, IT, telephone, and other related expenses and RheoMinerals’ general office expenses. The increase in this category is mainly due to higher directors’ and officers’ insurance and compliance costs as a result of the NYSE listing. Professional fees of $1,247 (2017 – $926) consist of legal fees of $571 (2017 – $ 436), consulting fees of $412 (2017 – $256), public relations fees of $34 (2017 – $95), and accounting fees of $230 (2017 – $139). Professional fees were higher during the year ended December 31, 2018 due to increased activities at corporate and Lithium Nevada. Salaries and benefits of $4,410 (2017 – $3,746) increased due to hiring of additional employees in 2018, employee bonuses accrued in Q2 2018, and an increase in directors’ fees.Regulatory and filing fees of $826 (2017 – $403) increased due to the costs of listing the Company on the NYSE and the filing of the base shelf prospectus in 2018.\n\nOther Items\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018 the Company recognized a foreign exchange gain of $3,828 (2017 – loss of $3,759). The gain was due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar and a higher US dollar denominated cash balance during the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company holds most of its cash in US currency in the parent company with Canadian dollar functional currency.\n\nOther income during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1,287 compared to other income of $642 in 2017. Included in other income during the year ended December 31, 2018 are $702 in interest income on cash, $796 interest income on the loans to the Joint Venture and $353 of proceeds received by RheoMinerals from Delmon, partially offset by $338 of interest expense on the senior credit facility and $232 of withholding tax on loan interest payments to the Company from Minera Exar. Included in other income in 2017 was $410 of Delmon proceeds, $400 in interest income on cash and $240 in interest income on the loans to the Joint Venture partially offset by $400 of equipment write-offs at RheoMinerals.\n\nQualified Person:\n\nThe scientific and technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Dr. Rene LeBlanc, a Qualified Person for purposes of NI 43-101 by virtue of his experience, education and professional association.  Mr. LeBlanc is the Chief Technical Officer of the Company.

(TSX: LAC; NYSE: LAC) (“Lithium Americas”, “LAC” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a definitive transaction agreement whereby Ganfeng Lithium Co., Ltd. (together with its subsidiary entities, “Ganfeng Lithium” or “GFL”) has agreed to subscribe, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, for 141 million newly issued shares of Minera Exar S.A. (“Minera Exar”), the holding company for the Caucharí-Olaroz lithium brine project (“Caucharí-Olaroz” or the “Project”), for cash consideration of US$160 million (such transaction, the “Project Investment”). As a result of the Project Investment, Ganfeng Lithium will increase its interest in Caucharí-Olaroz from 37.5% to 50%, with Lithium Americas holding the remaining 50% interest (each subject to the rights of JEMSE (the Government of Jujuy) to acquire an approximate 8.5% interest in Minera Exar).\n\n“The new US$160 million investment by our partner Ganfeng significantly de-risks Caucharí-Olaroz by providing additional assurances that the Company remains fully-funded for the current 25,000 tpa development plan and supports the evaluation of an increase in initial production capacity to 40,000 tpa of lithium carbonate,” commented Tom Hodgson, CEO, and Jon Evans, President and COO. “We are delighted to have Ganfeng Lithium and Lithium Americas as 50/50 partners in Caucharí-Olaroz and we look forward to building on our long and productive history of working together.”\n\n“Construction activities at Caucharí-Olaroz continue to accelerate as planned and support the targeted start of production in H2 2020,” commented Gabriel Rubacha, President of South America Operations. “Ganfeng Lithium will play a key role in the process definition, engineering and commissioning of the lithium chemical plant leveraging their track record as the world leader in the production of high-quality lithium compounds for electric vehicle and battery customers.”\n\nProject Update\n\nLAC and GFL continue to work with Minera Exar to optimize Caucharí-Olaroz with the goal of producing the highest quality battery grade lithium carbonate for the lowest cost. LAC and GFL have directed Minera Exar to undertake a feasibility study in respect of an increase in the stated production capacity of the Project from 25,000 tpa to an aggregate of 40,000 tpa of lithium carbonate, as well as to advance certain permitting, design and other development planning activities at Caucharí-Olaroz.\n\nLAC and GFL remain committed to ensuring Caucharí-Olaroz is fully funded for the capital costs necessary to complete construction of the current 25,000 tpa development plan. The 25,000 tpa capital cost estimate of US$425 million, on a 100% basis and before value-added taxes (“VAT”), remains unchanged.\n\nThe feasibility study work being undertaken is exploring an increase in initial production using current infrastructure under development, including the existing 12 km2 pond design under construction. Based on work completed by Minera Exar to date, the Company anticipates substantial capital cost efficiencies from the increased scale being considered.\n\nTwo evaporation ponds have been completed and additional four ponds are under construction. The filling of the first pond with brine commenced in October 2018. A total of seven wells are currently pumping brine to the ponds and three more wells are under construction.\n\nEngineering is continuing and is on track to support the procurement and construction activities. Requests for quotations for most of the long lead equipment were issued and firm proposals are under evaluation. The first plant construction package was awarded and the contractor has been mobilized to perform the work. Procurement is advancing on schedule for equipment related to pond operations.\n\nMinera Exar has increased the size of its team to support operations and construction activities. There are currently more than 200 full-time Minera Exar employees. 476 people are working at the site, including 172 Minera Exar employees and 304 contractors. Current camp capacity at the site allows to accommodate 554 people and additional 128 beds will be added shortly in preparation for plant construction activities.\n\nResource Update\n\nLAC has completed an updated mineral resource estimate for lithium at Caucharí-Olaroz and has obtained a National Instrument 43-101 technical report in respect of the updated mineral resource estimate (the “Resource Estimate TR”) entitled “Updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Caucharí-Olaroz Project, Jujuy Province, Argentina ” with an effective date of March 1, 2019. A copy of the Resource Estimate TR is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. At a cut-off of 300 parts per million lithium (“ppm Li”), the updated Resource Estimate is as follows:\n\nUpdated Mineral Resource Estimate for Lithium at Caucharí-Olaroz \r\n (effective March 1, 2019)Category Average \r\n Lithium \r\n Grade \r\n (mg/L) Brine \r\n (m3) Lithium \r\n Metal \r\n(tonnes) LCE \r\n (tonnes)Measured 587  1.11E+09  651,100 3,465,700 Indicated 580  4.70E+09  2,726,300 14,511,500 Measured & Indicated581 5.81E+09  3,377,400 17,977,200 Inferred 602  1.59E+09  957,400 5,096,000\n\nNotes:\r\n(1)   Mineral Resources have a cut-off grade of 300 mg/L of lithium.\r\n(2)   Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the Mineral Resource will be converted to Mineral Reserves.\r\n(3)   LCE is calculated based on the following conversion factor: mass of LCE = 5.322785 x mass of lithium metal.\r\n(4)   This Mineral Resource Estimate has an effective date of March 1, 2019.\n\nThe mineral resource estimate provided above maintains approximately the same total average lithium concentration of Measured and Indicated mineral resource (585 mg/L vs. 581mg/L) and an increase of 53% for total lithium carbonate equivalent (“LCE”) Measured and Indicated mineral resources (11,752,000 tonnes of LCE vs. 17,977,200 tonnes of LCE). The Resource Estimate TR reflects the expansion of the mineral resource base at Caucharí-Olaroz but otherwise leaves in place the scientific and technical information derived from the Company’s 2017 definitive feasibility study. The authors of the Resource Estimate TR have recommended, among other things, that the Company complete additional work to update the mineral reserve estimate at Caucharí-Olaroz and undertake the feasibility study work in respect of a possible project expansion. The Company anticipates having the results of the ongoing feasibility work in respect of a possible project expansion by the end of 2019.\n\nTransaction Details\n\nUnder the terms of the Project Investment, Ganfeng Lithium has agreed to subscribe for approximately 141 million shares of Minera Exar for cash consideration of US$160 million. The Project Investment shall be used by Minera Exar for the purpose of construction and development of Caucharí-Olaroz.  As a result of the subscription, the Company and Ganfeng Lithium will each hold a 50% interest in Minera Exar and Caucharí-Olaroz.\n\nLithium Americas and Ganfeng Lithium have agreed to implement certain amendments to the shareholders agreement governing the joint venture, including to provide equal representation on the Minera Exar board of directors and the Management Committee governing the joint venture.\n\nIn addition, on closing of the Project Investment, Minera Exar is expected to repay an US$8 million loan that was previously advanced by the Company in order to provide interim funding used for the construction and development of Caucharí-Olaroz during the closing of the 2018 transactions between Lithium Americas and Ganfeng Lithium.\n\nThe Project Investment constitutes a “related party transaction” within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”) because Ganfeng Lithium and its affiliates are significant (16.9%) shareholders of Lithium Americas. Consequently, the Project Investment is subject to the formal valuation and minority approval requirements set forth in MI 61-101.\n\nThe Project Investment will require the approval of a simple majority of the votes cast at a special meeting of Lithium Americas shareholders (“LAC Meeting”), excluding Ganfeng Lithium and its affiliates and any other persons required to be excluded in accordance with Multilateral Instrument 61-101 of the Canadian securities regulatory authorities. As a related party transaction, the board of directors of Lithium Americas (the “Board”) constituted a special committee of independent directors (the “Special Committee”) for the purposes of, among other things, considering the Project Investment, reviewing, directing and supervising the process to be carried out by the Company and its professional advisors in assessing and negotiating the Project Investment, and considering and making recommendations to the Board with respect to the Project Investment. The Special Committee is composed of Jean Fraser (Chair), Gary Cohn and George Ireland. In considering the Project Investment, the Special Committee retained Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt LLP as its independent legal counsel and Blair Franklin Capital Partners Inc. (“Blair Franklin”) as its valuator and independent financial advisor.\n\nBlair Franklin has provided a formal valuation in respect of the Project in accordance with MI 61-101. A copy of the formal valuation will be included in the management information circular to be sent to LAC shareholders. In addition, Blair Franklin has provided an opinion to the Special Committee, stating that, in their opinion and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications contained in the fairness opinion, as of the date of the fairness opinion, the consideration paid under the Project Investment is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company.\n\nAfter careful consideration and deliberation, the Special Committee determined that the Project Investment is in the best interests of Lithium Americas and is fair to shareholders of the Company (other than Ganfeng Lithium and its affiliates) and unanimously recommended to the Board that the Board approve the Project Investment.\n\nFollowing receipt of the unanimous recommendation by the Special Committee, the Board (with interested directors having recused themselves) determined that the Project Investment is in the best interests of Lithium Americas and is fair to shareholders of the Company (other than Ganfeng Lithium and its affiliates) and unanimously approved the Project Investment.\n\nIn addition to the LAC shareholder approval, closing of the Project Investment is subject to approval of the shareholders of Ganfeng Lithium, to regulatory approvals in China applicable to GFL, and the consent of BCP Innovation Pte. Ltd. in its capacity as lender pursuant to LAC’s senior credit facility\n\nLAC and GFL have agreed to hold their respective shareholder meetings as contemporaneously as reasonably possible.\n\nFurther information regarding the Project Investment and other transactions described herein will be contained in a management proxy circular the Lithium Americas will prepare, file and mail to its shareholders in advance of the LAC Meeting. Copies of the transaction agreement and management proxy circular will be available in due course on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\n\nQualified Person:\n\nThe scientific and technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Dr. Rene LeBlanc, a Qualified Person for purposes of NI 43-101.

The Lithium market is surrounded, as you know, by positive news. Full electric vehicle penetration level reached approximately 2%, and these rates are expected to grow probably in the future. Demand growth in 2018 surprised us again, surpassing 27%, and it's expected to grow rates above 20% in 2019,” said Ramos.\n\nAs the lithium leaders pave the way for bullish sentiment in the sector, incumbent new sources of lithium are being developed by a select few players in the space advancing lithium brine projects.\n\nE3 METALS CORP. (TSXV: ETMC) (OTC: EEMMF), a lithium development company with a property containing 6.7 Mt LCE inferred mineral resource in Alberta, announced a major milestone in the development of its proprietary extraction process, a key to their future positioning in the market.\n\nSince its inception in 2017, E3 Metals has quadrupled its permit size, put out a maiden resource and subsequently tripled it, developed proprietary Ion Exchange Lithium Extraction Technology and advanced its lithium process closer to commercialization.\n\nThe Company is close to piloting its technology which converts oilfield brine into pure high-grade feedstock to be transformed into valuable lithium products, with optionality for hydroxide or carbonate.\n\nSummarized from the news: E3 has enhanced performance of its proprietary Ion Exchange Lithium Extraction Technology, achieving higher lithium concentrations of up to 5367 mg/L lithium, compared to the previous level of 1498 mg/L. Average recovery was over 90%, confirming very high efficiency and greater than 99% impurity removal.\n\nE3 Metals’ CEO Chris Doornbos stated, “This increase in concentration using our proprietary Extraction Technology is the key to unlocking the value of our vast, yet lower grade, resource. These results move us a significant step toward supporting E3’s goal of becoming an industry leading, low-cost producer of battery grade lithium products. We have demonstrated the ability to significantly increase our lithium concentration without using additional energy. The higher concentration means less volume to handle downstream from our lithium Extraction Technology and should reduce the energy, inputs and potentially the capital and operating costs required to generate lithium hydroxide. These results continually demonstrate an innovative and robust process developed by the University of Alberta supported by Green Centre Canada, with funding from Alberta Innovates.”\n\nNeo Lithium Corp. (TSXV: NLC) (OTCQX: NTTHF) says it aims to be known as a “prominent new name in lithium brine exploration by virtue of its high quality 3Q Project and experienced team.”\n\nThe Company recently announced that the lithium carbonate pilot plant built by the Instituto de Investigaciones Tecnologicas from Universidad de Concepcion, Chile has successfully arrived in Fiambala, Catamarca, Argentina. The Company’s engineers have started reassembling the Plant and expect to have it fully operational in late February for its Tres Quebradas lithium brine project in Catamarca Province, Argentina.\n\nThe Plant was previously successfully tested with synthetic brine in Chile and is going to start using brine from the 3Q Project, concentrated approximately to 4% lithium from 3Q Project pilot evaporation ponds to start pilot scale production of lithium carbonate at the Plant. Currently the designed annual capacity of the pilot ponds is over 500 tonnes of approximate 4% lithium brine per year, and the Plant has a designed capacity of 50 tonnes of lithium carbonate per year.\n\nLithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC), advancing its Cauchari-Olaroz lithium brine project in Jujuy, Argentina and Thacker Pass lithium claystone project in Nevada, USA to production just reported temporary disruptions in Argentina due to heavy rainfall.\n\nAlso included in the update; “Following the release of the Preliminary Feasibility Study in August 2018, through development of a pilot plant in Reno, Nevada, the Company is considering the production of lithium hydroxide directly from lithium sulphate to provide added flexibility. Commissioning of the pilot plant is underway, with testing and optimization expected to commence in the near term.”\n\nFrom pilot plants to full production, the lithium sector is ramping up for long term global demand. Incumbent lithium brine companies will be able to compete if they can keep their costs down and advance their extraction technologies, readying themselves for the EV highways of the future.\n\nInvestor Ideas directory of lithium stocks: mining stocks directory and cleantech stock directories, relating to batteries.\n\nAbout Investorideas.com \r\nhttps://www.investorideas.com/About/\n\nSocial Media \r\nTwitter https://twitter.com/Investorideas\r\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/Investorideas\r\nYouTube https://www.youtube.com/c/Investorideas\n\nDisclaimer/Disclosure: Our site does not make recommendations for purchases or sale of stocks, services or products.

"2018-11-14T11:30:00+00:00","Lithium Americas Reports Third Quarter 2018 Financial and Operating Results","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov.  14, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC) (""Lithium Americas"" or the ""Company"") has announced its financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2018.\n\nThis news release should be read in conjunction with Lithium Americas’ unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and management's discussion and analysis (""MD&A"") for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, which are available on Lithium Americas’ website, SEDAR and EDGAR.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nCauchari-Olaroz:\n\nOn October 31, 2018, Lithium Americas completed a series of transactions (“Transaction”) with subsidiaries of Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium Co., Ltd. (“Ganfeng”) and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (“SQM”) with respect to the Cauchari-Olaroz lithium project in Jujuy, Argentina (“Cauchari-Olaroz”). As a result of the Transaction, Lithium Americas increased its interest in Minera Exar S.A. (“Minera Exar”), the holding company for Cauchari-Olaroz, to 62.5% from 50% with Ganfeng holding the remaining 37.5%. Development activities are on schedule with the advancement of detailed engineering, ponds construction, production wells drilling, camp construction, plant design and supply purchases to support the start of Stage 1 production in 2020. No delay is anticipated to the production schedule as a result of the Transaction. The first evaporation pond was completed and commenced filling with brine in October 2018. Engineering is continuing and is on track to support the first bid packages for plant construction during the fourth quarter of 2018. A total of $41 million has been advanced to Minera Exar during the first nine months of 2018 (including $22.5 million by the Company) in the form of equity contributions and loans. An additional $12 million was advanced to Minera Exar subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2018 (including $9 million by the Company). Minera Exar has increased the size of its team and there are approximately 180 full-time Minera Exar employees and over 200 additional contractors working on Cauchari-Olaroz in Argentina. Initial Stage 1 capital cost estimate of $425 million, on a 100% basis and before value-added taxes (“VAT”), remains unchanged.\n\nLithium Nevada:\n\nOn August 2, 2018, the Company filed the preliminary feasibility study for the Thacker Pass lithium project (“Thacker Pass”). The permitting process for Thacker Pass is underway, with environmental baseline data collection substantially complete and a conceptual Mine Plan of Operations submitted to the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”). Lithium Americas continues to collaborate with Ganfeng on the development of the pilot plant testing programs for Thacker Pass. A pilot plant and laboratory is being constructed in Reno, Nevada to optimize the process (predominantly to reduce the consumption of sulfuric acid) and to provide feed samples to crystallizer vendors who will design the equipment and provide performance guarantees. The Company is evaluating potential partnership and financing scenarios for Thacker Pass.\n\nRheoMinerals:\n\nThe sales of RheoMinerals for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $3.4 million (2017 – $3.8 million). Sales for Q3, 2018 were $1.4 million (2017 - $1.1 million).\n\nFinance:\n\nAs at September 30, 2018, the Company had $26.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. As part of the Transaction, Ganfeng has also provided a loan to Minera Exar to permit Minera Exar to repay $25 million of its outstanding indebtedness to the Company, of which $17 million was received by the Company and the balance is repayable by the end of 2018. The Company has a $205 million credit facility to finance its share of capital expenditures in Minera Exar. Since the start of Q3 2018, the Company has received $15 million on its first drawdowns of this credit facility ($10 million of which occurred during Q3 2018).

"2018-08-14T23:35:00+00:00","Lithium Americas Reports Second Quarter 2018 Financial and Operating Results","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug.  14, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX:LAC)(NYSE:LAC) (""Lithium Americas"" or the ""Company"") has announced its financial and operating results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2018.\n\nThis news release should be read in conjunction with Lithium Americas’ unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and management's discussion and analysis (""MD&A"") for the six months ended June 30, 2018, which are available on Lithium Americas’ website and on SEDAR.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nCauchari-Olaroz:\n\nDevelopment activities continue as planned with the advancement of detailed engineering, ponds and camp construction, plant design and supply purchases, with Stage 1 production expected to commence in 2020. Engineering for the infrastructure is over 89% complete and, due to certain changes not affecting the overall schedule, is scheduled to be completed during the second half of 2018. Plant design for Phase I shows a progress of 74% on track to issue the first plant construction bid work packages in late 2018. Evaporation ponds construction commenced in early February 2018 and the filling of the ponds is expected to begin in the second half of 2018.  Earth works, production well drilling and hydrological testing are underway. $29 million has been advanced to Minera Exar during the first half of 2018 by the Joint Venture partners (including $14.5 million by the Company) in the form of equity contributions and loans. There are currently approximately 400 people working in Argentina, including direct employees and contractors. In addition to the scope currently under execution by Hatch Ltd. (“Hatch”) for the detailed engineering of the project, Hatch has also been engaged to provide project controls services to the project. In May 2017, a technical report prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) that summarizes the Stage 1 Definitive Feasibility Study was filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and an updated technical report was filed on January 17, 2018.\n\nLithium Nevada:\n\nOn June 21, 2018 the Company announced the preliminary PFS results and on August 2, 2018 the Company filed the Preliminary Feasibility Study (“PFS”) for its Thacker Pass lithium project. The PFS, prepared and approved by WorleyParsons Canada Inc., demonstrates a design capacity of 60,000 tonnes per annum (“tpa”) of battery-grade lithium carbonate (“Li2CO3”) with initial production capacity of 30,000 tpa (“Phase 1”) and increasing to 60,000 tpa (“Phase 2”). The PFS contemplates average life of mine (LOM) operating costs of $2,570/t of Li2CO3, net of credits from sulfuric acid and electricity sales. Initial capital costs, including a 19% contingency, are estimated at $581 million for Phase 1, and $478 million for Phase 2. Average annual EBITDA of $520 million ($246 million – Phase 1), after-tax NPV of US$2.6 billion (at an 8% discount rate) and after-tax IRR of 29.3% are projected, assuming a price of US$12,000/t for battery-grade Li2CO3. On April 5, 2018 the Company updated the Measured and Indicated mineral resource at its Thacker Pass project to 6.0 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (“LCE”) at 2,917 parts per million lithium (“ppm Li”) and the Inferred mineral resource to 2.3 million tonnes of LCE at 2,932 ppm Li. This represents an approximate 80% increase in the Measured and Indicated mineral resource from the Company’s 2016 resource estimate and establishes Thacker Pass as the largest known claystone lithium resource in the United States. Lithium Nevada has identified extensions of high-grade (average 3,998 ppm Li) and near-surface lithium mineralization adjacent and northwest of the proposed 2012 pit boundary. The Company is considering potential partnership and financing scenarios to advance the Thacker Pass project.\n\nRheoMinerals:\n\nThe sales of RheoMinerals for the six months ended June 30, 2018 were $2.0 million (2017 – $2.8 million). In 2016, RheoMinerals entered into a “Technical Assistance and Royalty Agreement” with Delmon Co. Ltd. in relation to the construction of a manufacturing facility by The Delmon Group of Companies in Saudi Arabia. The plant is undergoing commissioning and product sales from the plant are expected to commence in Q4 2018. Delmon has achieved product certification with the leading Saudi Arabia oil producer, for the organophilic leonardite product, DEL-TROL HT, that will be manufactured at the new facility in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Delmon is currently in the process of achieving certification of its product, DEL-GEL organophilic bentonite. The Company is entitled to net profit and gross profit royalties from the future production of the plant.\n\nFinance:\n\nIn February 2018, the Company filed a final short form base shelf prospectus in each province of Canada, other than the Province of Quebec, to qualify the distribution, from time to time over a 25-month period, of up to $500 million of the Company’s debt and equity securities. The Company also filed a corresponding shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form F-10 under the Multijurisdictional Disclosure System. While the Company has no immediate plans to raise capital, the shelf prospectus provides financial flexibility and the ability to efficiently access capital markets as the Company pursues future growth opportunities in Argentina, Nevada or elsewhere. As at June 30, 2018, the Company had US$31.5 million in cash and cash equivalents.  As a result of the completion of investment agreements with GFL International Co., Ltd. (“Ganfeng”) and The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited in 2017, the Company has a US$205 million credit facility to finance its share of capital expenditures with respect to the Minera Exar. On August 8, 2018 the Company received $5 million on its first drawdown of this credit facility.\n\nCorporate:\n\nIn January 2018, the Company announced that it had received approval for the listing of its common shares (“Common Shares”) on the NYSE. The Common Shares opened for trading on the NYSE on January 25, 2018.\n\nSubsequent Event:\n\nOn August 13, 2018 the Company announced that it has entered into agreements to implement several transactions (together, the “Transaction”), pursuant to which, among other things, a subsidiary of SQM has agreed to sell its interest in Minera Exar to a subsidiary of Ganfeng. As a result of the Transaction, Lithium Americas’ interest in the Caucharí-Olaroz project will increase from 50% to 62.5% with Ganfeng holding the remaining 37.5% interest.  In connection with the Transaction, Ganfeng has also agreed to provide Lithium Americas with a new $100 million unsecured, limited recourse, subordinated loan facility. With this new source of financing, the Company expects to have more than sufficient financial resources to fully fund its 62.5% share of Minera Exar’s capital expenditures related to Stage 1 of the Caucharí-Olaroz project.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Ganfeng has also agreed to provide a loan to Minera Exar to permit Minera Exar to repay $25 million of its outstanding indebtedness to the Company.\r\n\r\nThe closing of the Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions.\n\nFinancial Results:\n\nThe following selected financial information is presented in thousands of US dollars, shares in thousands, unless otherwise stated and except per share amounts\n\nThe following table summarises the key items that resulted in the decrease in net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2018 (Q2 2018) versus the three months ended June 30, 2017 (Q2 2017), as well as certain offsetting items:\n\nFinancial resultsQuarter ended June 30, Change 2018 2017 $ $ $ Organoclay sales855 1,612 (757)Cost of sales(1,312)(1,815)503 Exploration expenditures(2,205)(829)(1,376)Organoclay research and development(141)(91)(50)General and administrative expenses(3,887)(1,211)(2,676)Share of loss in Joint Venture(106)(3,482)3,376 Stock-based compensation(1,014)(2,356)1,342 Foreign exchange gain/(loss)876 (1,672)2,548 Other income/(expense)285 118 167 Net Loss(6,649)(9,726)3,077\n\nNet loss for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was $6,649 compared to $9,726 for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in the net loss was mainly attributable to the lower loss from the Joint Venture (as most costs were capitalized in the three months ended June 30, 2018, but expensed during the three months ended June 30, 2017), lower stock-based compensation and higher foreign exchange gain partially offset by higher exploration expenses at the Thacker Pass project and higher general and administrative expenses. Basic and diluted loss per share was $0.08 in Q2 2018 versus $0.15 in Q2 2017.\n\nThe organoclay sales in Q2 2018 was $855 (Q2 2017 - $1,612), with related production costs of $1,125 (Q2 2017 - $1,633), depreciation expense of $184 (Q2 2017 - $222), and inventory writedown of $3 (Q2 2017 – reversal of $40) resulting in gross loss from organoclay sales of $457 (Q2 2017 - $203). The decrease in sales is due to the timing of oil drilling products orders which rebounded in July, 2018.\n\nOrganoclay research and development costs are consistent from period to period and include costs of operating the research and development team and lab for new organoclay product development.\n\nExploration expenditures in Q2 2018 of $2,205 (Q2 2017 – $829) include expenditures incurred for the Thacker Pass project. The increase in the Company’s exploration expenditures is mostly due to advancing the Thacker Pass project.\n\nLoss from the Joint Venture in Q2 2018 of $106 (Q2 2017 – $3,482) represents the Company’s share of the Joint Venture losses for the Cauchari-Olaroz project. In July 2017, the Joint Venture’s Cauchari-Olaroz project entered the development phase. Effective July 1, 2017, all costs directly attributable to the project are being capitalized. The Company’s share of the Joint Venture losses decreased in Q2 2018 compared to Q2 2017 as the majority of costs incurred in Q2 2018 were capitalized as project development costs.\n\nStock-based compensation in Q2 2018 of $1,014 (Q2 2017 - $2,356) is a non-cash expense and consists of the $766 (Q2 2017 - $839) estimated fair value of stock options vested during the period and the $248 (Q2 2017 - $1,517) fair market value of restricted shares. In Q2 2018 the Company granted 21 restricted shares to its employees. The increase in this category was due to vesting of the 2017 stock option grants and restricted share awards to the Company’s employees and officers.\n\nIncluded in General and Administrative expenses in Q2 2018 of $3,887 (Q2 2017 - $1,211) are:\n\nOffice and administrative expenses of $314 (Q2 2017 - $163) includes Vancouver, Reno, and Toronto office rent, insurance, IT, telephone, and other related expenses and RheoMinerals’ general office expenses. The increase in this category is mainly due to higher directors’ and officers’ insurance costs as a result of the NYSE listing. Professional fees of $367 (Q2 2017 - $108) consist of legal fees of $218 (Q2 2017 – $20), consulting fees of $64 (Q2 2017 - $12), public relations fees of $3 (Q2 2017 - $31), and accounting fees of $82 (Q2 2017 - $44). Professional fees were higher in Q2 2018 due to increased activities at corporate and Lithium Nevada. Salaries and benefits of $2,183 (Q2 2017 - $525) include salaries, benefits, and bonuses for the Company’s employees and directors’ fees. The increase in salaries and benefits is due to hiring additional employees in the second half of 2017 and Q1 2018 and annual bonuses in Q2 2018. Regulatory and filing fees were $524 (Q2 2017 - $42). The increase is due to the costs of listing the Company on the NYSE and filing of the base shelf prospectus on February 7, 2018.\n\nOther Income/expense in Q2 2018 includes a foreign exchange gain of $876 (Q2 2017 – loss of $1,672). The gain was due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar and a higher US dollar denominated cash balance in the Q2 2018 period.

Construction of production wells and ponds is well underway with the first pond scheduled to be filled in second half of 2018 and plant construction expected to commence in early 2019.\n\nAs part of the Transaction, SQM has agreed to provide the support needed to ensure a smooth transition and the continuity of ongoing work at the Project.\n\nReview of the Transaction\n\nThe board of directors of Lithium Americas (the “Board”) constituted a special committee of independent directors (the “Special Committee”) for the purposes of, among other things, considering the Transaction, reviewing, directing and supervising the process to be carried out by the Company and its professional advisors in assessing and negotiating the Transaction, and considering and making recommendations to the Board with respect to the Transaction.\n\nThe Special Committee was composed of Jean Fraser (Chair), Gary Cohn, George Ireland and Chaiwat Kovavisarach. In considering the Transaction, the Special Committee retained Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP as its independent legal counsel and Cormark Securities Inc. (“Cormark”) as its independent financial advisor. Cormark has provided a fairness opinion to the Special Committee, concluding that, as of August 12, 2018, the Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company and the shareholders of the Company (other than Ganfeng Lithium and its affiliates).\n\nAfter careful consideration and deliberation, the Special Committee determined that the Transaction is in the best interests of Lithium Americas and is fair to shareholders of the Company (other than Ganfeng Lithium and its affiliates) and unanimously recommended to the Board that the Board approve the Transaction.\n\nFollowing receipt of the unanimous recommendation by the Special Committee, the Board (with an interested director having recused himself) determined that the Transaction is in the best interests of Lithium Americas and is fair to shareholders of the Company (other than Ganfeng Lithium and its affiliates) and unanimously approved the Transaction.\n\nThe funding by Ganfeng Lithium of Minera Exar in connection with the Transaction and the provision of the Loan Facility by Ganfeng Lithium to the Company constitutes a “related party transaction” within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”). Lithium Americas is relying on the exemptions from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements set forth in MI 61-101. Specifically, the funding by Ganfeng Lithium of Minera Exar is exempt from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements on the basis of the exemptions in sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, as neither the fair market value of the subject matter of the relevant transaction, nor the fair market value of the consideration for the relevant transaction, insofar as it involves Ganfeng, is greater than 25% of Lithium Americas’ market capitalization (calculated in accordance with MI 61-101). The Loan Facility is not subject to the requirement to obtain a formal valuation. The Loan Facility is also exempt from the minority approval requirements on the basis of the exemption in section 5.7(f) of MI 61-101, as: (i) the Loan Facility is a loan that has been obtained on reasonable commercial terms that are not less advantageous to Lithium Americas than if the loan or credit facility were obtained from a person dealing at arm’s length with the Company, and (ii) the Loan Facility contains no equity component. Provision of the Loan Facility to Lithium Americas and the intercompany loans to  Minera Exar from Ganfeng Lithium are subject to the approval of the shareholders of Ganfeng Lithium. Lithium Americas has entered into voting support agreements from Ganfeng Lithium’s largest shareholder, who holds an approximate 24% interest in Ganfeng Lithium, pursuant to which such shareholder has agreed to vote in favour of the transaction. If the shareholder approval is not obtained, Ganfeng Lithium has agreed to fund the intercompany indebtedness by way of equity in a manner that does not impact the relative interests of the parties and to cede a portion of its rights to off-take from Minera Exar to Lithium Americas in respect of the US$100 million Loan Facility.\n\nThe Transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2018, and is subject to customary closing conditions.\n\nStrategic Collaboration\n\nLithium Americas and Ganfeng Lithium recognize the significant potential that exists in exploring future collaboration opportunities. The Strategic Collaboration is expected to leverage Lithium Americas’ experience and track record operating in Jujuy, Argentina, and Nevada, USA, with Ganfeng Lithium’s strong technical capabilities producing high-quality lithium products, including producing concentrated lithium brine into battery-quality lithium carbonate.\n\nLithium Americas’ relationship with Ganfeng Lithium commenced in 2016 with the financing and off-take agreement for Caucharí-Olaroz. Since that time, both companies have engaged and worked extensively with one another, and understand each other's respective values, strategic priorities and operating capabilities. Senior management and technical teams have participated in multiple site visits to Lithium Americas’ and Ganfeng Lithium’s operations in Argentina, the United States, and China. Complementing Lithium Americas’ experience and expertise in project and process development, and exploration, Ganfeng Lithium is expected to provide access to substantial internal engineering, construction and project execution expertise. Lithium Americas and Ganfeng Lithium both bring extensive management experience that is aligned to the rapid development of lithium resources.\n\nBeyond Caucharí-Olaroz, Lithium Americas and Ganfeng Lithium have agreed to explore further opportunities to work together on future partnerships.\n\nAs part of the Strategic Collaboration Agreement, Lithium Americas and Ganfeng Lithium have agreed to form a management committee and a technical committee (the “Committees”), which will include representatives from both companies. Global Lithium LLC, an independent lithium advisory firm managed by its President, Joe Lowry (“Global Lithium”), has agreed to advise the Committees on potential opportunities, and work together with both parties on business development opportunities.\n\n“I have had the pleasure of knowing and working with Ganfeng Lithium for 15 years,” commented Joe Lowry, President of Global Lithium, “Ganfeng Lithium’s vision and project execution skill has enabled the company to become a global power in  lithium and the related green energy ecosystem. In addition to high quality resources, Lithium Americas has assembled the best combination of top management and technical talent among emerging companies, having drawn key personnel from major lithium producers and some of the largest users. Global Lithium looks forward to supporting the strategic alliance between Ganfeng Lithium and Lithium Americas and the obvious synergy that will result from expanding their relationship.”\n\nAdvisors and Counsel\n\nCormark served as financial advisor to the Special Committee and Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt LLP served as the Special Committee’s legal advisor. Cassels Brock & Blackwell LLP and Alfaro Abogados served as legal counsel to Lithium Americas.\n\nSimpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and Gowlings WLG LLP acted as legal advisors to Ganfeng Lithium.\n\nWinston & Strawn LLP, Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP and Marval, O'Farrell & Mairal acted as legal advisors to SQM.\n\nConference Call\n\nLithium Americas will host a conference call for analysts and investors on Tuesday, August 14, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. EST, followed by a question-and-answer session.\n\nTo access the call, please dial:\n\nNorth America (toll-free): 1 (888) 231-8191\r\nInternational: 1 (647) 427-7450\n\nA telephone replay of the call will be available from 1:00 p.m. EST on August 14, 2018 until 11:59 p.m. EST on September 9, 2018.

(TSX:LAC) (NYSE:LAC) (""Lithium Americas"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to provide the results of a Preliminary Feasibility Study (""PFS"") for the Thacker Pass lithium project (""Thacker Pass"" or the “Project”) in Humboldt County, Nevada.  Unless otherwise stated, all figures are quoted in U.S. dollars (""$"") and are reported on a 100% equity project basis.\n\nThacker Pass is located in the McDermitt Caldera and is 100% owned by Lithium Nevada Corp. (“Lithium Nevada”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lithium Americas. The PFS, prepared and approved by WorleyParsons Canada Inc. (“WorleyParsons”), demonstrates a design capacity of 60,000 tonnes per annum (“tpa”) of battery-grade lithium carbonate (“Li2CO3”) with initial production capacity of 30,000 tpa (“Phase 1”) and increasing to 60,000 tpa (“Phase 2”). The PFS supports a proven and probable reserve estimate (“Mineral Reserves”) of 179.4 million tonnes of ore with an average grade of 3,283 parts per million lithium (“ppm Li”) containing 3.1 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (“LCE”).\n\n“The strong economics demonstrated by the PFS clearly support the commercial potential for this large, high-grade clay-based lithium resource,” commented Alexi Zawadzki, Lithium Americas’ President of North American Operations. “With the experience of our team and leveraging our strong partner relationships, we plan to rapidly advance this scalable project to become the leading source of lithium production in the USA.”\n\n“Thacker Pass is an important complement to our Cauchari-Olaroz lithium joint venture currently under construction in Jujuy, Argentina. The PFS reflects the substantial synergies and value realized from leveraging the talent and operating expertise of our largest shareholder, Ganfeng Lithium,” commented Tom Hodgson, CEO of Lithium Americas. “As a large U.S.-based lithium project with strong economics, we expect Thacker Pass to attract significant strategic partnership opportunities to accelerate the path to production.”\n\nA summary of the results of the Thacker Pass PFS are provided in Table 1:\n\nTable 1: Thacker Pass - PFS Results\n\nLithium carbonate price$12,000/t Li2CO3Mining methodContinuous open-pit miningAnnual production capacity60,000 tpa Li2CO3 (Phase 1 - 30,000 tpa)Mineral reserves3.1 million tonnes of LCE at 3,283 ppm LiMine life46 yearsStrip ratio (waste-to-ore mined)\r\nPit depth (max)1.6:1\r\n120 mInitial capital costs$1,059 million (Phase 1 - $581 million)Operating costs (average LOM)$2,570/t Li2CO3 ($4,088/t before by-product credits)EBITDA (average annual)$520 million (Phase 1 - $246 million)NPV (8% discount, pre-tax)$3.9 billionNPV (8% discount, after-tax)$2.6 billionIRR (pre-tax)36.6%IRR (after-tax)29.3%\n\nProject Details\n\nThe Thacker Pass Project is located in Humboldt County in northern Nevada, USA. The Project is situated at the southern end of the McDermitt Caldera, approximately 100 km northwest of Winnemucca, 33 km northwest of Orovada and 33 km due south of the Oregon border. The Project is accessible via a paved highway with good regional infrastructure including power and rail. Northern Nevada is recognized as one of the most concentrated areas in the world for skilled mining labor.\n\nThe Project has been designed to avoid environmentally sensitive and rugged terrain, which is expected to reduce permitting timelines, construction risk and costs.  The plant and tailings facilities are in the low-lying area of Thacker Pass and immediately adjacent to the pit, which houses the Thacker Pass deposit, the largest and highest-grade known sedimentary lithium deposit in the USA.  The flat and expansive terrain allows for a very compact footprint and allows for future potential expansions.\n\nThe PFS contemplates initial Phase 1 production capacity of 30,000 tpa of battery-grade Li2CO3  commencing in 2022 and increasing in Phase 2 to 60,000 tpa in 2026. The Project will be developed as an open-pit mining operation using conventional continuous mining equipment. Given the soft nature of the deposit, minimal blasting and crushing is anticipated. The ore will then be processed in a leaching circuit using sulfuric acid to liberate the lithium from the claystone. Following the leaching process, the lithium bearing solution will be purified using crystallizers and reagents to produce battery-grade Li2CO3.\n\nWith the reliance on sulfuric acid, the Project will involve the construction of a 5,280 tonnes per day (“tpd”) (2,640 tpd – Phase 1) conventional sulfuric acid plant at site. The sulfuric acid plant will convert molten sulfur into low-cost sulfuric acid reducing transportation costs and providing a low-cost source of power. Excess acid will be sold locally to large consumers in the region. In addition, the sulfuric acid plant contemplates a co-generation facility, providing enough carbon-free electricity to power the entire Project with excess power being sold to the grid.\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f9694a83-dba3-4745-8570-209dda53f46e\n\nMining\n\nThe mining operation for the Project is planned as a simple and low-cost open-pit mine using a small fleet of surface miners. Given the soft nature of the claystone, minimal blasting is anticipated and will be limited to areas in the deposit with basalt formations. The mine plan includes excavating highest-grade and lowest strip ore in the early years of production; however, ore grades do not fluctuate substantially throughout the life of mine (“LOM”).  The ore body begins at or near surface, with the maximum depth of the pit reaching 120 m.  The average ore mining rate is 7,296 tpd for Phase 1 and 13,062 tpd for Phase 2.\n\nThe mine plan contemplates mining of 509.8 million tonnes of material consisting of 330.4 million tonnes of waste rock and 179.4 million tonnes of ore (delivered to plant) over a 46-year mine life. The average strip ratio for the Project is 1.6:1 waste-to-ore mined with an average strip ratio of 1.5:1 during the first four years of the mine plan. In-pit waste backfill will total 285 million tonnes, with only 2.2 million tonnes being transferred by truck to a nearby waste rock dump. Waste rock is also used as fill for project infrastructure. The average grade of the ore is 3,283 ppm Li.\n\nThe tonnes, grades, and classification of the Mineral Reserves captured within the PFS mine plan are summarized in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Thacker Pass - Mineral Reserves\n\nCategoryTonnage\r\n (000 t) Avg.

Reductions attributed to plant losses have not been included.\r\n2.     Mineral Reserves are presented at a 2,500 ppm Li cut-off grade.\r\n3.     The conversion factor for lithium metal (100%) to LCE is 5.323.\r\n4.     Applied density for the ore is 1.79.\n\nCollaboration with Ganfeng Lithium\n\nMetallurgical testwork for the PFS was carried out at production facilities owned and operated by Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium Co.,Ltd. (“Ganfeng Lithium”) in Jiangxi Province, China. The process testwork benefited from a close collaboration between Ganfeng Lithium and Lithium Americas’ respective technical teams.\n\nLithium Americas provided four statistically representative composites of ore from the deposit that characterize the different grades of ore exposed by drilling in the proposed pit area. These samples were based on the mass weighted average of the deposit and were assembled from different depths and locations to ensure a representative testing campaign.\n\nThe initial process flow sheet concept was developed by Lithium Americas. The test program was developed with Ganfeng Lithium’s engineering and technical teams.  Much of the process test work was carried out by Ganfeng Lithium and complimented Lithium Americas test work on ore preparation, tailings handling and storage design. Results from this testing were incorporated to the process flow sheet using the industry-standard Aspen chemical process model.  A final bench-scale confirmation test was completed at Ganfeng Lithium’s facilities. The process engineering and design for the process plants and infrastructure were based on the results of the test work, as well as Aspen process model results.\n\nLithium Americas and Ganfeng Lithium intend to collaborate further on the development of the pilot plant testing programs for Thacker Pass. Ganfeng Lithium’s existing facilities provide an accelerated and low-cost opportunity to demonstrate the process technology at a commercial scale.\n\nProcessing\n\nThe production process is designed to use conventional and commonly-available equipment, arranged to take advantage of the distinctive qualities of the high-grade ore.  The process comprises a series of steps to concentrate, separate and produce battery-grade Li2CO3.\n\nFirst, ore from the mine will be crushed, screened and then transferred as a slurry to the leaching circuit where sulfuric acid will be added to attack the ore and liberate the lithium from the clay. The high-grade quality of the ore allows for leaching to occur in stirred reactors (vats), specifically designed to maximize speed and efficiency of lithium dissolution, while minimizing sulfuric acid consumption. Total leaching time is estimated at three hours.\n\nThe resulting lithium-bearing solution will then go through a pH-neutralization step. Neutralization will be achieved with ground limestone during start-up and sustained with recycled alkaline solids from an upstream precipitation process during normal operation. Next, the lithium solution will undergo a crystallization step using steam and electricity from the sulfuric acid production process. Water is removed for recycling, and magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) is produced. Any magnesium remaining in solution is removed in a second step that involves the addition of reagents to precipitate magnesium hydroxide.\n\nFinally, soda ash will be added to the lithium bearing solution to produce a high-quality, battery-grade Li2CO3. Much of the water contained in the lithium solution will be recovered and returned to the process.  The total time projected to manufacture battery-grade Li2CO3 from the ore is less than 24 hours. The overall recovery of lithium from the ore is 83%.\n\nWaste from the process will be separated into three distinct streams: clay tailings, magnesium sulfate and sodium/potassium sulfate. Separation of these streams allows for potential future processing and sale of these salts. Tailings and salt storage facilities are located adjacent to the plant.\n\nA diagram illustrating the process flowsheet is shown in Figure 2.\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/a541e8a5-443c-49d4-b206-8323fc9da379\n\nSulfuric Acid Plant\n\nThe price of sulfuric acid is a major factor in the economics demonstrated by the PFS. The price of sulfuric acid has fluctuated from a low of $30/t to a high of $200/t over the past 15 years. The on-site production of sulfuric acid will create value for the Project in three ways, by: (i) reducing transportation costs - one part molten sulfur will make three parts sulfuric acid; (ii) producing steam and electricity; and (iii) generating revenue through sale of excess acid and electricity to the market.\n\nSupplies of molten sulfur, the feedstock for a sulfur-burning sulfuric acid plant, are available as a reliable by-product from numerous chemical processing locations throughout the western USA. In 2017, approximately 9 million tonnes of sulfur were produced in the USA with 46% produced in the Rocky Mountain and West Coast regions. The main benchmark price in the molten sulfur domestic market, the Tampa quarterly price, has remained relatively stable since 2016 and is expected to remain $66 - $97/t (delivered) through 2023.\n\nModern acid plants represent a clean technology and have been recently permitted throughout the United States. Soda ash, already available in large quantity at the plant site for Li2CO3 production, will be used in a tail gas scrubber arrangement to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions well below the US EPA Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) limit of 90 tpa.\n\nThacker Pass Phased Expansion\n\nThe Thacker Pass PFS entails the design of a production facility reaching a capacity of 60,000 tpa Li2CO3, through two 30,000 tpa Li2CO3 construction phases. The production capacity was selected based on anticipated market demand. Although not contemplated in the PFS, Phase 2 may be re-designed to increase production capacity, based on market conditions.\n\nPhase 1 construction is targeted to commence in 2020 with lithium production beginning in 2022. Reagent and product transport in Phase 1 is serviced entirely by trucks via the existing paved State highway network adjacent to the plant.\n\nPhase 2 construction is projected to start in 2025, with added production entering the market by 2026.  Capital costs for Phase 2 are estimated at $478 million.  Additional infrastructure in Phase 2 includes (i) doubling the sulfuric acid capacity by building a second acid plant, (ii) increasing capacity in ore preparation, leaching, filtration, crystallization, and reagent storage, and (iii) construction of a rail line with service directly to the plant.\n\nPhase 2 includes the construction of a 93 km rail line that interconnects the plant with a Union Pacific main line (“UP Line”) near Winnemucca. The proposed rail route alignment involves minimal cut-fill balancing due to near-flat topography, resulting in a low cost of construction. The rail line streamlines the transportation of reagents and products, reduces operational costs and allows for significant future plant expansions.  The UP Line is connected to existing facilities producing soda ash (Wyoming), limestone (Nevada) and molten sulfur (various locations). The capital cost ($105 million) and operating cost of the rail line are included in the PFS; however, there is the potential to assign responsibility for construction and operation of the railway to a third-party rail operator.\n\nCredits from Sulfuric Acid and Electricity Sales\n\nThe only by-products from Li2CO3 production contemplated in the PFS are excess sulfuric acid and electricity. The distribution of gross revenue between Li2CO3 and by-products are presented in Table 3.\n\nA ""captive"" co-generation sulfur-burning acid plant, with an on-site turbine waste-heat electric power generating unit, would reduce sulfuric acid and electricity costs. It is estimated that the 2,640 tpd acid plant proposed for Phase I will generate 35 MW of electricity. In Phase II, a second 2,640 tpd sulfuric acid plant, supplemented with additional heat recovery equipment, would produce an estimated total electrical output of 80 MW. Depending on pricing for electricity sales and consumption needs, the Project may sell all electricity produced, or only the excess produced when the Project’s electrical power requirements are satisfied. The PFS considers selling all electricity produced by the co-generation facility at 0.0756 $/kWh and purchasing power from the grid at 0.0632 $/kWh. This carbon-free firm electricity is a premium, in-demand product that can stabilize intermittent renewable energy production.\n\nThe design capacity of the sulfuric acid plants in Phase 1 and Phase 2 facilitate the sale of excess acid, which can be sold and distributed to regional manufacturers and mining customers. The credits from electricity and excess acid sales result in a LOM production cost of sulfuric acid of $8.23/t H2SO4 (based on 100% concentration) or $262/t LCE using sulfur at $146/t (delivered) as the base case.\n\nTable 3:  Thacker Pass - Distribution of Gross Revenue\n\nPhase 1\r\nAverage Annual RevenuePhase 2\r\nAverage Annual RevenueLife of Mine\r\nTotal RevenueCategory($ millions)(%)($ millions)(%)($ millions)(%)Lithium carbonate$36890.4%$70588.7%$31,23388.8%Electricity$215.0%$486.1%$2,1186.0%Sulfuric acid$184.6%$415.2%$1,8335.2%Total$407100.0%$794100.0%$35,185100.0%\n\nCapital Costs\n\nThe capital cost estimates are based on quotes for current labor and materials costs. The Phase 1 construction capital cost are estimated at $581 million inclusive of a 19% contingency. Construction and commissioning are expected to take approximately 21 months, with production expected to commence in 2022, subject to receiving final permits. At a price of $12,000/t Li2CO3, cashflow from Phase 1 is expected to fully-fund the capital costs of Phase 2. Detailed capital cost estimates are presented in Table 4.\n\nTable 4: Thacker Pass - Capital Costs\n\nCategoryPhase 1\r\nCapital Costs\r\n($ millions)Phase 2\r\nCapital Costs\r\n($ millions)Total\r\nCapital Costs\r\n($ millions)Direct Costs Lithium carbonate plant$218$96$314Sulfuric acid plant$134$158$293Mine$46$1$47Railroad and yards$3$81$84Total Direct Cost$401$336$737Total Indirect Cost$89$65$154Contingency (18.8%)$91$77$168Total Capital Costs$581$478$1,059\n\nOperating Costs\n\nThe operating costs are based on an operation achieving average annual production of approximately 30,000 tpa and rising to 60,000 tpa of battery-grade Li2CO3. The estimated average operating cost for the mine, and processing facilities are as follows:\n\nTable 5: Thacker Pass - Operating Costs\n\nCategoryOperating Cost\r\n ($/t Li2CO3)% of TotalMining$48812.0%Lithium processing$1,64940.0%Sulfuric acid plant$1,78044.0%General and administrative$1563.6%Electricity delivery (wheeling charge)$150.4%Total Operating Costs$4,088100.0%\n\nProject Economics\n\nThe financial results are derived from inputs based on an annual production schedule included in the Thacker Pass PFS. A sensitivity analysis on the unlevered economic results over a 46-year operating period are summarized in Table 6 and reported on a 100% equity project basis.\n\nTable 6: Thacker Pass - After-Tax NPV and IRR Sensitivity Analysis\n\nDiscount RateLow Case NPVBase Case NPVHigh Case NPV(%)$10,000/t Li2CO3\r\n($ millions)$12,000/t Li2CO3 ($ millions)$14,000/t Li2CO3 ($ millions)6%$2,790 $3,800 $4,811 8%$1,856 $2,591 $3,327 10%$1,259 $1,816 $2,373 IRR (%) 24.0% 29.3% 34.3%\n\nThe Project is subject to a 1.75% royalty on net revenue produced directly from ore. This royalty has been included in the economic model with the assumption that the Company will exercise its right under the terms of the royalty to reduce the royalty from 8.0% to 1.75% by making an upfront payment of $22 million in the first year of operations.  At $12,000/t Li2CO3 the ongoing annual royalty payments will average $210/t Li2CO3 sold. The royalty is not applicable to revenues from the sale of electricity and sulfuric acid.\n\nCommunity and Environment\n\nLithium Americas has developed a community engagement plan, recognizing that the well-being of all stakeholders is essential to the success of the Project.  The Project was designed reflecting information collected during numerous stakeholder meetings, including a public open house.  This approach is expected to mitigate potential concerns at the design level, and ensures the local community is included early in the development process.  Future public open houses are planned as the project advances to ensure the community is fully engaged.\n\nEconomic Benefits to Nevada and USA\n\nThe Thacker Pass PFS demonstrates the Project will provide substantial economic benefits to the USA at the local, state and national levels, including:\n\nDirect employment of at least 800 high paying jobs during the 21-month construction period (Phase 1);Direct employment of at least 292 high paying permanent positions during the 46-year operation;Several hundred indirect jobs with suppliers of products and services to support mine operations;$1.7 billion capital investment on a combined basis for both Phases 1 and 2 including sustaining capital;Payments to the federal and state governments totaling approximately $6.7 billion in the form of corporate tax over 46 years (based on a price of $12,000/t of Li2CO3);Training and skills development programs aimed at maximizing local employment in Nevada; andExpected improvement of local and regional infrastructure.\n\nPermitting\n\nEnvironmental leadership is a core value of Lithium Americas.  Thacker Pass has been engineered to minimize the environmental footprint, by avoiding sensitive environmental habitat and employing the best available environmental control technologies.\n\nPhase 1 of the project is located entirely on federal lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), which will be the lead agency for issuing federal approval under the Mining Law surface management regulations and for the preparation of the Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”). Other permits will be required from various state and federal agencies.\n\nThe process for permitting a lithium mine on federal lands in the USA is currently being reviewed as a result of Presidential Executive Order 13817, which calls for a federal strategy to ensure secure and reliable supplies of critical minerals.  A critical mineral is defined as being a non-fuel mineral, with a vulnerable supply chain, that is essential to the economic or national security of the USA.  Lithium is categorized as a critical mineral.  The new federal strategy is expected to include streamlining of permitting and review processes to expedite production of critical minerals.\n\nThe project could benefit from an accelerated permitting procedure that supports the federal mandate to enhance domestic lithium production.  For the purposes of the PFS, a construction start date of Q4 2020 was assumed.  This may be revised once details of the new federal permitting process are released.\n\nLithium Americas began the permitting process in Q1 2018 by commencing baseline data collection.  The baseline data collection process is scheduled to be substantially complete by Q4 2018.  A Mine Plan of Operations is expected to be ready for submission in Q3 2018, with the EIS to be submitted to the regulators by Q3 2019.  Approvals would be issued following the regulatory review of the EIS.\n\nNext Steps and Recommendations\n\nThe Thacker Pass PFS has assumed a development timetable as follows:\n\nQ2 2018 – Commence exploration drilling aimed to increase resource size northwest of the pit area and in the SW Basin (see Figure 1)Q3 2018 - Commence pilot testing and additional trade-off studies; advance basic engineering towards constructionQ3 2018 - Submit Mine Plan of Operation for Phase 1Q3 2019 - Submit EIS for Phase 1Q4 2020 - Receive final permits and begin construction of Phase 1Q3 2022 - Commissioning and first Phase 1 productionQ2 2025 - Federal and State approvals obtained for rail corridor and plant expansionQ2 2025 - Commence construction for Phase 2Q3 2026 - Commissioning and Phase 2 production\n\nThe Thacker Pass PFS and Lithium Americas have identified a number of areas for further consideration. These include:\n\nSale of an intermediate product. To improve financing flexibility, Lithium Americas is considering the production of an intermediate product with the final processing to be completed by a separate company.Production of other lithium compounds (i.e. lithium hydroxide and lithium metal). Lithium Americas will consider leveraging the plant design to manufacture lithium hydroxide (LiOH). In addition, the Company will consider the production of lithium metal from Li2CO3 produced at the plant.Lithium-ion battery recycling facility. Lithium Americas will consider leveraging the plant design for future inclusion of a lithium ion battery recycling facility.Extraction of additional critical minerals (Presidential Executive Order 13817). Lithium Americas will continue to evaluate the feasibility of extracting and processing other critical minerals within the Thacker Pass deposit currently treated as waste.Railway partnership. Lithium Americas will evaluate the potential to engage an experienced rail industry partner to build, own and operate the proposed rail spur from the UP main line to the plant.Acid plant partnership. Lithium Americas will evaluate the potential for a partnership(s) in the ownership, construction and/or operation of the acid plants. This could include a joint venture partnership or a third-party build-own-operate structure. Solar power plant. Lithium Americas will evaluate the feasibility of generating solar electricity near the plant site to increase revenue and reduce the environmental footprint of the project.\n\nQualified Person\n\nThe contents of this press release have been prepared under the supervision of, and reviewed and approved, by, the following persons, each of whom is a Qualified Person (“QP”) as defined under National Instrument 43-101 and an independent consultant to the Company:\n\nLouis Fourie, P.Geo., WorleyParsons, QP for mineral resources and QA/QC and data verification;Dan Peldiak, P.Eng., WorleyParsons, QP for the Process Design;Reza Ehsani, P.Eng., WorleyParsons, QP for the Infrastructure;John Young, SME-RM, Great Basin Environmental Services, LLC, QP for the Environmental and Society;Andrew Hutson, Fellow of AusIMM, Mining Plus, QP for the mine engineering aspects and Mineral Reserves;Ken Armstrong, P.Eng., Chemetics Inc., a Jacobs company, QP for the sulfuric acid plant;Don Kime, Chemetics Inc.; andRob Spiering, P.Eng., Project Director, WorleyParsons, QP for Estimate and the Economic Analysis, and for all remaining disclosure.\n\nPlease see the Company’s technical report dated effective February 15, 2018 and entitled, “Independent Technical Report for the Thacker Pass Project, Humboldt County, Nevada, USA”, available via SEDAR, for a description of the quality assurance / quality control program and data verification processes employed to develop the information presented in this news release.\n\nAbout Lithium Americas:\n\nLithium Americas, together with SQM, is developing the Cauchari-Olaroz lithium project, located in Jujuy, Argentina, through its 50% interest in Minera Exar.

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserves.\r\n2. Resources presented at a 2,000 ppm Li cut-off grade.\r\n3. The conversion factor for lithium metal (100%) to LCE is 5.323.\n\nA new geologic and grade block model was created using the historical and 2017 drilling information.  Calculation of the updated Resource Estimate was performed using a cut-off of 2,000 ppm Li, the same cut-off used in the June 2016 Independent Technical Report for the Lithium Nevada Property, Nevada, USA.\n\n2017 Exploration Program\n\nThe intent of the 2017 Exploration Program was to identify a resource of scale in the Thacker Pass area (formerly Zone 1) of the Lithium Nevada Project, where habitat quality is substantially lower than in the Montana Mountains to the north (Figure 1a).  In Thacker Pass, 77 exploration holes totaling 6,653 meters were drilled, a seismic survey was conducted and the surface geology of the project was remapped.\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/dcdb3373-6484-43ce-b0a0-24165e6061ef\n\nThe drilling data is presented in Table 2 and the locations of the exploration holes are presented in Figures 3a and 3b. 13 holes were drilled in the newly defined northwest expansion area (Figure 1b and Figure 4). This area is located northwest of the mine pit that was proposed in a 2012 mine plan. The assay data from all these holes averages 3,998 ppm Li, higher than the assay data from the infill drilling. The ore zone averages 46 m thick in this area (Figure 2).\n\nThe 2017 Exploration Program also resulted in the discovery of an area identified as the Southwest Basin (Figure 1b) with high concentrations of Li and minimal overburden. Seven of the exploration holes intersected lithium mineralization.\n\nThe 2017 Exploration Program did not intersect the western boundary limit of lithium mineralization in the northwest expansion area. Additional drilling is planned in this area as part of the proposed 2018 Exploration Program (Figure 2). New drilling in 2018 will further explore the lateral extent, thickness and depth of lithium mineralization in unexplored areas east of Thacker Pass.\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/2b6d978a-55d0-4267-bc13-61ff0910b0f6\n\nPreliminary Feasibility Study Update\n\nLithium Nevada is advancing a PFS, which is being prepared pursuant to NI 43-101, in order to demonstrate the economic potential of producing high-value lithium products from claystone.  The Company has successfully completed process test work to validate a conceptual process flowsheet. The process employs low-risk commercially-proven acid leaching, purification and crystallization technologies to efficiently produce lithium products for the battery industry. Lithium Nevada is advancing the engineering design and costing work and is on track to provide the results of the PFS on schedule by the end Q2 2018.\n\nLithium Nevada Project Timeline\n\nQ2 2018 – advance additional baseline environmental surveyQ2 2018 – release results of PFSH2 2018 – initiate major mine plan permittingH2 2018 – commence detailed engineering\n\nTable 2: Lithium Nevada - Thacker Pass 2017 Drilling Data\n\nHole (LNC-)TD (m)OverburdenLength (m)\r\n>2000 ppm LiLi ppm AvgLi ppm Max001186.5420.4860.323311610000260.96--17827300397.44--271248000446.36--351145000560.96--21299000660.96--17937900783.06--12941100876.20--3101470009154.7221825.6229504050010212.48--481255001171.846.1025.122692395001254.13--102690013121.9239.4129.602910617001476.29--1831340015122.413.1750.443221634001695.2817.6835.143226535001745.816.5811.3133215800018122.713.6349.403005582001982.753.0558.303553642002078.4610.5247.583706692002180.106.0453.594083766002246.51--399179002346.57--487275002454.8617.1319.382926498002576.99--402135002695.1020.6356.7533695550027106.686.2861.143555587002889.1814.5158.2836137230029107.4715.8559.443454548003076.208.4155.873310688003190.7413.2359.253663754003280.0411.0654.893749721003389.189.3357.763729762003461.756.2546.884031804003540.423.5430.424136772003692.293.8470.713377744003792.2315.7356.143486699003895.2813.8157.643586694003989.1812.8960.293545750004087.6913.9361.083874795004145.722.5334.843805704004295.2815.2569.243453699004391.0116.2861.083505718004489.2511.4662.273789696004584.6116.0054.533841691004666.5417.3739.963655732004788.6714.5454.413860739004892.2916.7060.443587690005792.2914.2061.333658737005895.1016.0057.0934457950059113.696.1068.673352617006095.34063.6733636620061112.0737.2556.973429567006296.9914.8761.363487670006390.7722.1954.863655645006454.196.9533.653965678006595.3423.4456.883663646006687.7213.0560.813741664006758.7717.4122.804797677006892.2913.2659.223721674006954.1911.7726.464445844007084.6714.5757.3335317160071101.4416.1859.1338867530072101.4421.0044.993741792007377.0510.2429.964309777007490.7721.3746.393819684007569.438.8140.364199769007698.3316.7655.263892810007774.0111.5847.553947722007887.9713.4154.253869677007963.614.0240.254950697008094.3420.0358.523829713008198.69--306008290.7418.4156.663843743008337.43019.023963518008467.766.7743.8337777540085113.6331.3363.1234746220\n\nNotes:\n\nHoles 049 through 056 which were drilled to target shallow industrial clay resources for Lithium Americas’ subsidiary, RheoMinerals Inc, were not tested for lithium, and therefore are not presented in this table.All holes are vertical (90o) except for hole LNC-083 (Az: 180o Dip -60o).\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/655b66d3-41b8-4802-b661-7bb9918195c0\n\nFigure Notes: Figure 3a has the same approximate location of the inset box in Figure 1a.

The geologist determined the length of the assay samples by lithology and averaged 1.73 m. The core was cut in half with diamond blade saws, using fresh water, and half bagged for sampling. For duplicate samples, one half of the core is cut in half again and the two halves are bagged and sampled separately to test sampling and assay precision. Each sample was assigned a unique identification number to ensure security and anonymity. Randomly inserted in the sample stream were QA/QC samples, which represent 10.1% of the total assays. The QA/QC samples include blanks to test for contamination, high and low-grade lithium standards to test for accuracy and duplicates to test for precision.Drilled core samples were collected from the core shed by ALS Minerals (“ALS”) and transported to their lab in Sparks, Nevada. At ALS, the samples were dried at a maximum temperature of 60 degrees Celsius and the entire sample was then crushed with a jaw crusher to 90% passing a ten-mesh screen. Nominal 250 gram splits were taken for each sample using a rifle splitter. This split is pulverized using a ring mill to 90% passing a 150-mesh screen.ALS’ analysis included four-acid digestion and inductively coupled atomic emission plasma spectroscopy to ensure that elevated metal concentrations were not present, which would interfere with inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy analyses.\n\nQA/QC protocols included:\n\nHigh, low and blank standards were inserted in random sampling intervals. These samples were also assigned a blinded sample identification number.Duplicate samples were taken every 30.48 meters. Each was assigned a blinded identification number.\n\nQA/QC statistical evaluations and results:\n\nThree low grade samples out of 63 assays fell outside the certified two standard deviation. All three were within 20ppm of falling within the two standard deviation criteria. All high-grade samples were within the certified two standard deviations.All blank standards reported less than 65ppm Lithium.All assay standards showed minimal bias drift with time.178 duplicate ¼ core samples, 356 assays, returned a R2 correlation value of 0.9915.\n\nThe scientific and technical information disclosed in this news release relating to the Resource Estimate has been prepared and approved by Louis Fourie, P.

(TSX:LAC)(OTCQX:LACDF)(""Lithium Americas"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to provide an update on the Lithium Nevada Project (the ""Lithium Nevada Project"") located in Nevada, USA. The Company is developing the 100% owned Lithium Nevada Project, a clay-based lithium resource in the McDermitt Caldera, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Lithium Nevada Corp. (""Lithium Nevada""). Building on years of exploration and testing, a Preliminary Feasibility Study (the ""PFS"") on the Lithium Nevada Project is expected to be complete by the end of Q2 2018 to demonstrate the economic potential of producing lithium hydroxide from lithium-bearing claystone.\n\nTechnical Team:\n\nLithium Americas has assembled a technical team that includes engineering alumni from several major industry participants, in addition to highly trained and experienced mining permit specialists and exploration and mining geologists.\n\nTo manage the Lithium Nevada Project's development, Lithium Americas has appointed Alexi Zawadzki as the President of North American Operations who will work alongside Dr. David Deak, President of Lithium Nevada and Chief Technical Officer of Lithium Americas. Alexi has over 20 years of experience developing and constructing mining and energy projects across North and South America, in addition to the management of technical teams and business units.\n\n""Supported by one of the strongest technical teams in the industry, we intend to develop the Lithium Nevada Project into a globally significant source of lithium,"" commented Alexi Zawadzki. ""Following the success of our partnership strategy with the Cauchari-Olaroz project in Argentina, we will continue to explore additional partnership opportunities for the Lithium Nevada Project with the goal of accelerating the timeline and lowering the development risk.""\n\nDr. David Deak added, ""With considerable work invested in resource definition and process technology, we believe the Lithium Nevada Project has the potential to be a leading low-cost and large-scale source of lithium products in North America.""\n\nCurrent members of the Reno-based Lithium Nevada Project team include:\n\nDr. David Deak, DPhil - President of Lithium Nevada and CTO of Lithium Americas - has built his career on emerging technologies and supply chain development in renewable energy, energy storage, and electric vehicles. David's responsibilities include oversight of the overall development of Lithium Nevada. Dr. Rene LeBlanc, PhD - Senior Process Development Manager - over 10 years of experience as a senior process development engineer at FMC Corporation's lithium division in Bessemer City, North Carolina and most recently at Tesla, Inc. Rene is focused on flowsheet development and overall management of the PFS. Mr. Doug Morgan - Senior Process Engineer - over 30 years of experience in various chemical engineering roles, including six years as senior engineer at Rockwood Lithium (now Albemarle Corporation) based in Silver Peak, Nevada. Doug's focus is on process technology development, testing, and flowsheet validation. Ms. Catherine Clark - Environmental Director - over 30 years of experience in project management and development, and environmental regulatory compliance. Catherine serves as the Environmental Committee Chairperson at the Nevada Mining Association and is focused on accelerating the permitting process for the Lithium Nevada Project. Mr. Randal Burns - Senior Mining Geologist - over 10 years of experience in mining geology, including resource drilling, metallurgical testing and ore control for a highly clay-altered porphyry copper deposit, at Robinson Nevada Mining Co. in Nevada. Randal is focused on exploration, resource expansion, and block modeling. Mr. Chaitanya Sharma, PE - Senior Systems Engineer - energy and mechanical engineer with experience in battery manufacturing and plant design, including a leadership role in designing the mechanical and process systems at Tesla, Inc.'s Gigafactory in Nevada.

Tom brings a highly-specialized skill set that will assist in potentially expanding the resource at the Lithium Nevada Project and in identifying new exploration targets.\n\nProcessing:\n\nThe Lithium Nevada Project is advancing a process technology with the objective to produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide from claystone. The flowsheet is designed to: (1) use leaching to liberate lithium from the ore, and (2) apply proven purification technology to produce high-quality lithium compounds. Leaching is believed to be advantageous when compared to previously considered processes as it avoids energy-intensive roasting, significantly reduces tailings volume, and maximizes the recovery of lithium through commercially-viable process technology.\n\nTest work is underway at a leading lithium manufacturing facility using a combination of laboratory and existing commercial production equipment. This strategic and cost-effective approach is targeted to advance the testing process towards final design and provides options for future strategic partnerships.\n\nOngoing process test work is currently focused on refinement of the following aspects of the flowsheet:\n\nthe characterization and beneficiation of ore; optimizing leaching and recovery conditions of lithium from claystone; and purification and production of high-value lithium compounds.\n\n""The process has been designed by challenging prior assumptions and leveraging commercially viable technologies. Our efforts are squarely focused on minimizing the cost,"" remarked Dr. Deak. ""While proprietary, much of our work relies on the application of commercially available solutions that could be deployed quickly and reliably. Recognizing market need, our process is designed to produce lithium hydroxide, the preferred feedstock for high energy density lithium-ion batteries.""\n\nDrill Program and Resource:\n\nThe Lithium Nevada Project's lithium clay resource is the largest known lithium resource in the United States, and is unconfined by drilling. An exploration program commenced in 2017 at the Lithium Nevada Project (the ""2017 Exploration Program"") consisting of drilling and seismic work. The purpose of the 2017 Exploration Program is to: (1) increase the confidence of the identified resource, (2) potentially expand the size of the resource, and (3) better understand areas that are unconfined by drilling.\n\nA total of 70 drill targets have been strategically located within, and to the south and to the east, of the Lithium Nevada Project's Zone 1 (previously referred to as Stage 1 in the Company's June, 2016 technical report entitled ""Independent Technical Report for the Lithium Nevada Property, Nevada, USA""), where some of the most highly-concentrated lithium clays in North America have been discovered. The 2017 Exploration Program is fully permitted, approximately 65% complete, and is expected to be concluded by early 2018.\n\nSeismic work was completed in 2017 and will be analyzed with the drilling data obtained from the 2017 Exploration Program to better understand the geological structures in areas unconfined by drilling to the east of Zone 1 of the Lithium Nevada Project. Additional seismic exploration is anticipated to be conducted in 2018.\n\nThe resource at the Lithium Nevada Project is near-surface and in some areas the overburden consists of hectorite clay, which has commercial value in other industries. Due to the soft nature of the claystone, conventional open pit mining using truck and shovel methods is contemplated with blasting not considered a requirement for day-to-day operations.\n\nMineral Resource Statement for Zone 1 (as of May 31, 2016)(1)(2)\n\nCategoryTonnage (000 t)Avg.

The PFS is expected to be completed by the end of Q2 2018.\n\nThe Advisian WorleyParsons Group (""WorleyParsons"") has been appointed to lead the PFS and project design. WorleyParsons is a global full-service engineering firm with extensive experience in lithium project design, construction, and preparing NI 43-101 compliant reports. WorleyParsons will focus on project infrastructure, mineral processing and metallurgical testing, capital and operating costs and project economics. Mining Plus Pty Ltd., a sub-contractor to WorleyParsons, will focus on potential mineral reserve estimates and mining methods. Mining Plus is a fully integrated global mining consultancy that has experience in open pit mining, including the development and operation of large-scale lithium mining projects in Australia.\n\nPermitting and Conservation:\n\nLithium Nevada is fully-permitted to complete the 2017 Exploration Program. Additional baseline environmental surveys are expected to begin in early 2018 with the major mine plan permit application expected to be initiated in H2 2018.\n\nLithium Nevada has existing fully-certificated water rights within the Quinn River Valley (located 25 km east of the proposed mine site at the Lithium Nevada Project) totalling approximately 1,000 acre-feet annually, which is expected to be sufficient for a large-scale lithium mine and processing facility.\n\nConsistent with Lithium Americas' focus on environmental sustainability, Lithium Nevada and the University of Nevada, Reno (""UNR"") have founded the Rangeland Rehabilitation Research Fund (the ""Fund""). The Fund's mission is to improve sagebrush habitat through effective habitat rehabilitation methods. The Fund will be administered by UNR. Lithium Nevada is providing the seed financing to kick-start the long-term initiative and is entitled to one nominee on Fund's board of directors. It is expected that other industry partners will participate and expand the research program. More details can be found at https://www.unr.edu/cabnr/gbsr-fund.\n\nAnticipated Work Program and Timeline:\n\nQ4 2017 / Q1 2018 - complete 2017 Exploration Program. Q1 2018 - finalize process testing. Q1 2018 - advance additional baseline environmental surveys. Q2 2018 - complete PFS, including updated resource and reserve estimates.

(""Minera Exar""), an Argentine company owned 50/50 by Lithium Americas and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (""SQM""). As previously announced, Minera Exar is pursuing a development plan at Cauchari-Olaroz for production capacity of 50,000 tonnes per annum (""tpa"") of battery-grade lithium carbonate (""Li2CO3"") in two stages, with each stage consisting of 25,000 tpa of Li2CO3. The Stage 1 DFS covers the first stage (""Stage 1"") and the plant for Stage 1 has been engineered to integrate production from the second stage (""Stage 2""). No estimated financial results or reserve estimate associated with Stage 2 are included in the Stage 1 DFS.\n\nThe results of the Stage 1 DFS are provided in Table 1 on a 100% equity project basis:\n\nTable 1: Cauchari-Olaroz Stage 1 DFS Results Stage 1 DFSLithium carbonate price$12,000/t Li2CO3Average annual production25,000 tpa Li2CO3Expected project life40 yearsProject capital costs$425 millionOperating costs$2,495/t Li2CO3Average annual EBITDA$233 millionPre-tax NPV 10% discount$1,266 millionAfter-tax NPV 10% discount$803 millionPre-tax IRR34.0%After-tax IRR28.4%Payback period3 years, 5 months\n\nTom Hodgson, CEO of Lithium Americas, commented: ""We are very pleased with the results of the Stage 1 DFS, which highlights the value created from our partnership with SQM, our experienced team in Argentina and strong support from the government of Jujuy. The Stage 1 DFS leverages our partner's expertise to develop a low-cost and long-life lithium project. We plan to start construction immediately upon closing our strategic investments with Ganfeng Lithium and Bangchak Petroleum, which are expected to close in the coming month.""\n\nProject Details\n\nCauchari-Olaroz is located in Jujuy Province in north-west Argentina. The Project is situated in the Salar de Olaroz and Salar de Cauchari, adjacent to Orocobre Ltd.'s Olaroz facility, which has been in production since 2015. The Project is approximately 270 km east of SQM's Salar de Atacama brine operation, accessible via an international highway. Cauchari-Olaroz is well serviced by nearby infrastructure including major paved highways, a national and international rail link which connects to the port of Antofagasta in Chile, a high-voltage power grid, and a gas pipeline.\n\nThe Stage 1 DFS is based on using a conventional, commercially-proven brine processing technology at Cauchari-Olaroz to produce high quality battery-grade lithium carbonate that can be used directly by battery material producers in manufacturing cathode and electrolyte for lithium-ion batteries.\n\nThe production process involves two distinct steps and is generally consistent with other established brine operations. The first step uses a solar evaporation process to concentrate lithium in the brine and precipitate competing salts in large-scale ponds. The ponds at Cauchari-Olaroz are based on SQM's pond design criteria used in their existing Atacama operation and involve the use of shallow ponds where the precipitated salt is annually harvested from the flat pond base. The second step uses the processing facilities that transform the concentrated lithium brine into battery-grade lithium carbonate while ensuring the removal of impurities from the end-product.\n\nThe Stage 1 DFS contemplates producing 25,000 tpa of battery-grade Li2CO3 for a project life of 40 years with production starting in 2019 The production and sale of potassium chloride (""KCl"") is not contemplated in the Stage 1 DFS.\n\nMinera Exar has granted a right to Jujuy Energia y Mineria Sociedad del Estado (""JEMSE""), a mining investment company owned by the government of Jujuy Province in Argentina, to acquire an 8.5% equity interest in Minera Exar and provide management services as required to develop the Project.\n\nPermitting Status\n\nMinera Exar has an approved Environmental Impact Statement (""EIS"") permit issued by the Province of Jujuy on July 11, 2012. Minera Exar's permitting status was recently affirmed by a letter from the Secretary of Mining and Hydrocarbons of the Province of Jujuy on March 21, 2017 confirming that Cauchari-Olaroz has the necessary permits to commence construction and operate in accordance with the EIS.\n\nEconomic Benefits to Jujuy Province and Argentina\n\nThe Stage 1 DFS demonstrates that Cauchari-Olaroz will provide substantial economic benefits to Argentina at the local, provincial, and national levels, including:\n\nDirect employment by Minera Exar of at least 800 people during the 2-year construction period; Direct employment by Minera Exar of at least 260 people in permanent positions during the 40 year operations; Several hundred indirect jobs with suppliers of products and services to support mine operations; Annual payments to the government totaling approximately $63 million in the form of income tax, corporate tax, and royalties (based on a price of $12,000/t of Li2CO3); Training and skills development programs aimed at maximizing local employment at the Project; Expected improvement of local and regional infrastructure; and Continuation and future expansion of existing community investment programs, small business development, and support of cultural development.\n\nOperating Costs\n\nThe operating and capital cost estimates have been reviewed and confirmed by Andeburg Consulting Services Inc. (""ACSI"") in accordance with NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. The Project cost estimates are based on an exchange rate of 16:1 Argentine pesos to the U.S. dollar. The average operating costs were calculated for a facility with production of 25,000 tpa of battery-grade Li2CO3, and are presented below in Table 2. Additional work through engineering refinements and contract negotiation will continue in an effort to reduce the operating expenditures.\n\nTable 2: Operating Costs Category Operating Cost\r\n ($/t Li2CO3) % of TotalReagents $991 40%Pond Harvesting & Tailing Management $345 14%Maintenance $210 8%Electric Power $187 7%Labour $166 7%Product Transportation $135 5%Catering, Security & Third Party Services $97 4%Natural Gas $85 3%G & A $76 3%Diesel $69 3%Consumables $51 2%Water Treatment System $38 2%Bus-In / Bus-Out Transportation $35 1%E & C $10 <1%Total Operating Costs $2,495 100%\n\nCapital Costs\n\nThe construction capital cost estimates are based on current Argentine costs for labor and materials. The Stage 1 construction capital cost is estimated at $425 million inclusive of a 15% contingency. Construction and commissioning will take approximately two years. Detailed capital cost estimates are presented in Table 3 and are exclusive of VAT and working capital. During construction, VAT and working capital are expected to total $51.1 million and $12.5 million, respectively.

Mineral Resources are summarized in Table 6 and reported on a 100% equity project basis.\n\nTable 6: Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources Category Average\r\n Lithium\r\n Grade (mg/L) Brine (m3) Lithium Metal (tonnes) Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (tonnes)Measured  630 9.1 x 108 576,000 3,039,000Indicated 570 2.9 x 109 1,650,000 8,713,000Total  585 3.8 x 109 2,226,000 11,752,000\n\nNotes:\n\n1) Mineral Resources have a cut-off grade of 354 mg/L of lithium.\n\n2) Mineral Resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted to mineral reserves.\n\n3) Lithium carbonate equivalent (""LCE"") is calculated based the following conversion factor: Mass of LCE = 5.323 x Mass of lithium metal\n\n4) The values in the columns on Lithium Metal and Lithium Carbonate Equivalent above are expressed as total contained metals within the relevant cut-off grade.\n\nMineral Reserve Estimation\n\nConsultants Montgomery & Associates Inc. (""M&A"") were engaged to update the Mineral Reserves in brine for various areas within the Salar de Cauchari and Salar de Olaroz in accordance with the guidelines for lithium brines set forth by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM 2012). The reserve estimate was based on numerical model simulations that demonstrated a sustainable maximum production rate of over 25,000 tpa of LCE for 40 years. The proven reserves include brines sourced entirely within the project's property boundaries, while 99.9% of the probable reserves are sourced within the project boundary. Simulated well field pumping was constrained by restricting drawdown to a maximum of 100 m at any given production well. A minimum cut-off value was not required in the reserve estimate because average lithium concentrations after 40 years of simulated pumping decreased marginally from 713 mg/L to 695 mg/L, which is significantly above economic mineral cut-off criteria.\n\nMineral Reserves for Cauchari-Olaroz have an effective date of March 5, 2017. Mineral Reserves are summarized in Table 7 and are reported on a 100% basis.\n\nTable 7: Proven and Probable Mineral ReservesCategory  Time Period\r\n (years) Average\r\n Lithium\r\n Grade (mg/L) Brine (m3) Lithium Metal (tonnes) Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (tonnes)Proven 1 - 5 712 4.9 x 107 35,159 187,000Probable 6 - 40 695 3.5 x 108 246,474 1,312,000Total 40 698 4.0 x 108 281,633 1,499,000\n\nNotes:\n\n1) Ratios of lithium to other metals include: K:Li of 8.2, Mg:Li of 2.4, B:Li of 1.6, SO4:Li of 28.5.\n\n2) LCE is calculated based the following conversion factor: Mass of LCE = 5.323 x Mass of lithium metal\n\n3) The conversion is direct and does not account for estimated processing losses.\n\n4) The values in the columns on Lithium Metal and Lithium Carbonate Equivalent above are expressed as total contained metals.\n\nConclusions and Next Steps\n\nLithium Americas contemplates that Minera Exar will commence construction immediately following the close of the Ganfeng Lithium and Bangchak Petroleum investment agreements. The construction timetable is targeted to follow:\n\nH1 2017 - Site preparation and camp construction  H2 2017 - Pond construction and wellfield installation commences  2018 - Plant construction; offsite infrastructure  2019 - Commissioning and first production\n\nReport Filing\n\nThe Company plans to file an NI 43-101 compliant technical report that summarizes the Stage 1 DFS on SEDAR (http://www.sedar.com) and on the Company's website (http://www.lithiumamericas.com) within 45 days.\n\nQualified Persons\n\nThe Stage 1 DFS was prepared in accordance with NI 43‐101 standards by M&A, AquaResource (a division of Matrix Solutions Inc.), Groundwater Insight Inc.

Information provided in this document is necessarily summarized and may not contain all available material information.\n\nThe release references Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. The estimation of Mineral Resources is inherently uncertain and involves subjective judgments about many relevant factors. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The accuracy of any such estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data, and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation (including estimated future production, the anticipated tonnages and grades that will be mined and the estimated recovery rates that will be realized), which may prove to be unreliable and depend, to a certain extent, upon the analysis of exploration results and statistical inferences that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Mineral Resource estimates may have to be re-estimated based on: (i) fluctuations in lithium price; (ii) results of further exploration work; (iii) the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimates; and (vi) revocation of required permits, approvals and licenses. Mineral Reserves are also disclosed in this release. Mineral Reserves are those portions of Mineral Resources that have demonstrated economic viability after taking into account all mining factors. Mineral Reserves may, in the future, cease to be a Mineral Reserve if economic viability can no longer be demonstrated because of, among other things, adverse changes in commodity prices, changes in law or regulation or changes to mine plans.\n\nAll such forward-looking information and statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by Lithium Americas management in light of their experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors management believes are appropriate in the circumstances.
