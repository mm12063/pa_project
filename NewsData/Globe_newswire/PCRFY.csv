Bain Capital, Blackstone Inc. and CVC Capital Partners are among the funds considering bids, Bloomberg News has reported. A successful deal, which may be private equity’s largest ever in the country, would signal the once-criticized investors have become more accepted in Japan.\n\nBut that remains far from certain. Toshiba directors have been disagreeing publicly over the company’s future, and the Japanese government, which deems the firm’s nuclear power business critical to national security, would have to sign off. What’s less in doubt is private equity has made progress in improving its reputation in Japan.\n\n“Things are starting to change,” said Kazuhiro Yamada, head of the Japan buyout advisory team at Carlyle Group Inc., the US investment house that manages $325 billion in assets. “Before, it was hard for private equity firms to even make an appointment,” he said. “Now, companies are increasingly approaching private equity.”\n\nThe number of deals involving private equity funds hit an all-time high of 134 in Japan last year, according to the consulting firm Bain & Co. The value of transactions more than doubled from the previous year to about 2.7 trillion yen ($20 billion), close to the record from 2017. Shiseido Co. and Hitachi Ltd., both founded more than a century ago, sold parts of their business to private equity last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven the government says private equity has changed in Japan. In the first half of the 2000s, many private equity firms “sought to increase the value of companies over the short term through debt workouts,” a representative of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry’s Industrial Finance Division said in emailed comments. These days, they try to raise the value of companies over the medium to long term, mainly through overseas expansion, business diversification or acquiring other companies in the same industry, the official said.\n\nThat’s a far cry from the early years of the century, when one buyout, in particular, shaped the image of private equity firms in Japan. In 2000, a consortium led by Ripplewood Holdings bought the collapsed Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (now Shinsei Bank Ltd.) from the government for a price that was considered low. Ripplewood made a big profit when Shinsei listed in 2004. The deal angered the Japanese public, especially as the state cleaned up the bank’s bad debts.\n\nForeign investment funds became labeled as “hagetaka,” or vultures. A wave of overseas activist funds didn’t help perceptions in the years before the global financial crisis as they pushed Japan Inc. for higher dividends and buybacks. In 2007, the public broadcaster NHK aired a popular TV drama series called “Hagetaka” about a western investment firm taking over ailing Japanese companies and forcing them to swallow painful restructuring.\n\n“Even my parents asked me if I’d become a vulture,” Carlyle’s Yamada recalled.\n\nWhen Carlyle bought one Japanese manufacturer, its staff looked at him, wondering “Who is this guy? Is he a foreigner?” he said.\n\nAround that time, Japanese companies would only talk to PE firms after they’d been spurned by peers in their industry, said Tetsuro Onitsuka, head of Japan private equity for Stockholm-based buyout firm EQT AB.\n\nBut in the years after the financial crisis, the situation started to change.\n\nAfter Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came to power at the end of 2012, he started to push companies to overhaul themselves, helping to sow the seeds for an increase in mergers and acquisitions.\n\n“People began to understand that there are many different kinds of investment funds and not all of them are hagetaka,” Onitsuka said.\n\nA key deal that helped change perceptions was KKR & Co.’s $1.7 billion purchase of Panasonic Corp.’s health-care unit, which was announced in 2013.\n\n“Panasonic is a very iconic company,” said Kunihiro Takahashi, head of corporate finance at Barclays Plc in Japan. “The fact that an American PE was able to buy a business from such a well-known company in Japan was very surprising.”\n\nIn 2017 came an even bigger milestone, when a consortium led by Bain Capital agreed to buy Toshiba’s crown-jewel memory-chip business for $18 billion. It was -- and remains -- private equity’s largest deal in Japan.\n\nThe buyout sent a “positive signal” that industries or assets deemed nationally important weren’t “off limits” to foreign investors, said Jim Verbeeten, a partner at Bain & Co. in Tokyo.\n\nTo be sure, not everyone is positive about private equity. The investors have been criticized for their tactic of leveraged buyouts, saddling companies with large debts, which can give them less room to maneuver when things go wrong. The LBO was immortalized in the book “Barbarians at the Gate” more than three decades ago about the takeover of tobacco and food conglomerate RJR Nabisco in the US.\n\nStill, “private equity investors provide the strategic capital which is needed for aging Japanese companies in an aging society,” said Nga Pham, a research fellow at Monash Centre for Financial Studies in Melbourne. As well as injecting funds, private equity firms offer the expertise needed to help transform companies, she said.\n\nDespite its recent successes in Japan, a buyout of Toshiba would be the true litmus test of whether private equity has arrived. The company, which has a market value of about $17.8 billion, has received eight privatization offers and two alliance proposals as part of its process to solicit strategic options. A sharply weakening yen is helping make Japanese companies more attractive for foreign investors. But nothing is decided, Chief Executive Officer Taro Shimada told Bloomberg in an interview this month, saying staying public is still a possibility.\n\nThat’s partly because Japan’s government could nix any deal.

"2022-06-20T10:31:26+00:00","3 Battery Stocks to Buy Before They Boom","Although electric vehicles have garnered intense interest lately, investors may be better served focusing on infrastructure-related battery stocks to buy rather than individual EV players.\n\nWith so many new upstarts in the electrification of transportation, it defies probabilities that all of them will enjoy significant upside success. However, every one of these companies needs lithium-ion-based powerpacks.\n\nFurther, the sharp losses among several EV manufacturers help drive the case for battery stocks to buy. Currently, the pain at the pump has many consumers eyeballing the transition to electrics. However, the free market isn’t stupid. Recognizing the increased demand, electric-powered cars have jumped in price, presenting all kinds of problems for individual players, from the smallest to the biggest.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n7 Retirement Stocks to Buy for a Bear Market\n\nOn the other hand, the list of battery stocks to buy appear more sensible because they’re akin to selling tickets to the big game as opposed to figuring out which team will win the match-up. While you might be limiting the ultimate profitability potential with infrastructural investments, you enjoy a higher chance of gaining something positive with the right names.\n\nTicker Company Current Price PCRFY Panasonic Holdings Corporation $8.26 SLDP Solid Power, Inc. $6.25 LAC Lithium Americas Corp. $20.13\n\nPanasonic (PCRFY) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing/Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the biggest brands among battery stocks to buy, Panasonic Holdings Corporation (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) has been making significant waves in the EV rumor mill. In early March of this year, Reuters reported that the company was looking to purchase land in the U.S. for a mega-factory, with the purpose of building a new EV battery for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nMore recently, InsideEVs.com reported in May that Panasonic was still searching for a U.S.-based site, including Oklahoma as a potential candidate. With the ability to churn out more batteries closer to Tesla’s new home in Texas, PCRFY is poised to drive higher in the market. Demand for Tesla EVs is not just increasing domestically – even right-hand-drive markets are demanding more units.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntriguingly, PCRFY appears to be charting a series of rising lows since the early summer of 2002. Therefore, the new factory site could be the catalyst to send shares flying, making Panasonic one of the best battery stocks to buy for the long haul.\n\nSolid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those investors that want to swing for the fences with battery stocks to buy, Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP) is a very enticing name. Specializing in all-solid-state battery cell technology — the holy grail that could kickstart a new paradigm in the global EV rollout — Solid Power presents a range of improvements over traditional lithium-ion batteries if successful.\n\nWhat’s most pertinent right now regarding wider EV integration is cost. I’ve mentioned this several times before but in February of this year, the average transaction price for a new EV hit just over $60,000. That’s just not sustainable when the median household income in the U.S. is around $70,000. And with inflation eroding the purchasing power of the dollar, consumers are falling further behind.\n\nHowever, Solid Power anticipates that its solid-state batteries could facilitate a 15% to 35% cost advantage over existing lithium-ion battery packs. Combined with other attributes such as higher energy and superior safety profile, SLDP is intriguing.\n\n7 Long-Term Stocks That Never Go Out of Style\n\nStill, as a former special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) with an aspirational target, strict money management would be appropriate.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) a lithium mine\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAlthough not a direct play among battery stocks to buy, Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) is nevertheless crucial to the manufacturing of powerpacks and therefore, to the global EV rollout. A lithium-mining firm, Lithium Americas is focused on advancing the Cauchari-Olaroz and Pastos Grandes projects in Argentina and the Thacker Pass project in Nevada.\n\nWhile EVs have been extraordinarily relevant for years, the military conflict in eastern Europe delivered a brighter spotlight to battery stocks to buy. Essentially, LAC is attractive primarily because of its exposure to generally stable jurisdictions. With China ranking among the top lithium producers in the world, it’s vital that the U.S. and its allies secure supplies of the potential “fuel” for the transportation networks of tomorrow.\n\nOtherwise, we could be suffering a Russia 2.0 scenario all over again.\n\nNow, it’s important to realize that lithium mining isn’t a panacea to geopolitical dependencies, particularly since the process consumes significant volumes of water. Still, as part of a diversified energy network, LAC could make a lot of sense.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The Japanese conglomerate is looking at potential factory sites in Kansas and Oklahoma that would supply the Tesla plant in Texas, two people with knowledge of the plan have said.\n\nThe Japanese company already has a factory in Nevada that supplies smaller batteries to Tesla. Production capacity there was recently expanded to 39 gigawatt hours (GWh).\n\nTesla Inc is Panasonic's only customer currently for the new cells, which are about five times bigger than those that the company now supplies.

"2022-05-23T10:40:41+00:00","4 Battery Stocks to Buy and Hold for Massive Gains","These battery stocks could create shareholder value thanks to growth in the electric vehicle (EV) market. FREYR Battery (FREY) — Agreements with large energy companies are likely to provide a growth roadway ahead. Panasonic (PCRFY) — A new facility in Japan dedicated to the production of EV lithium-ion batteries should speed up production and increase revenue. QuantumScape (QS) — A new research and development center in Kyoto will open a new market of customers in the Asia-Pacific region. Romeo Power (RMO) — A recent agreement to provide lithium-ion batteries for a new line of low-speed EVs could mean enhanced revenue. 4 Battery Stocks Price Chart\n\nBattery stocks, our topic for today, have had a rough year so far. Fears of an economic downturn have added to the woes of an industry plagued by persistent supply chain issues.\n\nYet, in the long-run, the outlook remains bright for companies in the growing electric vehicle space. Recent research highlights, “Between 2020 and 2026, the size of the global electric vehicle market is expected to increase over four-fold to reach an estimated market size of some one trillion U.S. dollars by 2026.” Such an increase would mean a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 23%.\n\nHigh inflation and expected interest rate hikes have made investors wary of putting names in high-growth names that may not yet be profitable. Since the beginning of 2022, the S&P Kensho Electric Vehiclesindex has fallen 33.5%. During the same period, the Global X Lithium & Battery TechETF (NASDAQ:LIT) has dropped 15.4%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n7 REITs to Buy for the Second Half of 2022\n\nDespite recent losses, many analysts concur that electric vehicles are the future of transportation. Therefore, manufacturers of key components for these cars are likely to soar as consumers switch to all-electric in the face of climate concerns as well as rising gas prices.\n\nWith that information, here are four battery stocks to buy in the coming months:\n\nStory continues\n\nFREY FREYR Battery $8.17 PCRFY Panasonic Holdings Corporation $8.83 QS QuantumScape Corporation $12.10 RMO Romeo Power, Inc. $0.87\n\nFREYR Battery (FREY) An electric car battery unit.\n\nSource: asharkyu / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first stock on today’s list, FREYR Battery (NYSE:FREY), comes from Norway. It design low-cost lithium-ion batteries for a variety of applications. It is building a facility in Norway, slated to begin production of lithium-ion batteries later this year.\n\nEarlier this month, this pre-revenue company reported first-quarter financials. Net loss was $34.9 million, compared to a net loss of $28 million the previous quarter. Loss per share was 30 cents, compared to 24 cents in Q4 FY21. Cash and equivalents totaled $524.6 million.\n\nRecently, the company announced an offtake agreement with Powin, an Oregon energy-storage solutions provider. FREYR has agreed to supply Powin with 28.5 GWh of battery cells from 2024 to 2030. This transaction represents the latest in a series of offtake agreements with other companies, including SiemensEnergy (OTCMKTS:SMNEY), AP Moeller – Maersk (OTCMKTS:AMKBY), and HoneywellInternational (NASDAQ:HON).\n\nFREY stock is down 32.8% year-to-date. The 12-month median forecast stands at $18 a share. FREY Battery’s market capitalization is currently shy of $1 billion.\n\nPanasonic (PCRFY) 10 Lithium Stocks to Buy Despite the Market's Irrationality\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNext up on our list is the consumer electronics giant Panasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY). The Japanese group is also the world’s third-largest producer of EV batteries. It has partnerships with Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to produce batteries for their EVs.\n\nIn early May, Panasonic released FY22 financials. Net sales were 7.39 trillion yen ($57.81 billion), up 100% year-over-year. Net profit attributable to shareholders also went up by 155%.\n\nInvestors paid close attention to the Energy segment, where sales increased by 27% to 764.4 billion yen from a year ago. This is due to increased sales of automotive batteries and power storage systems with significant growing demand for EVs globally as well as growing demand for Internet-of-Things (IoT) and social infrastructure use.\n\n7 Dividend Stocks to Boost Your Retirement Savings\n\nIn fiscal 2023, management expects strong revenue, thanks to recovery in the automobile and aviation industries as well as growing demand for automotive batteries, according to a statement.\n\nPanasonic recently announced construction plans for a new lithium-ion battery production facility in Japan. Production should begin in March of 2024.\n\nDespite the positive outlook, PCRFY stock has lost about 19.6% since January. The current price supports a dividend yield is 2.21%. Shares are trading at 10.76 times forward earnings and 0.37 times trailing sales. Finally, the 12-month median forecast stands at $11.44.\n\nQuantumScape (QS) A sign for QuantumScape (QS).\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur third battery stock pick is QuantumScape (NYSE:QS). This pre-revenue group focuses on solid-state EV batteries. It is working on developing a fast-charging, anode-less EV battery, capable of recharging up to 80% in 15 minutes.\n\nIn late April, QuantumScape issued Q1 metrics. GAAP net loss totaled $90.4 million, compared to $75 million the year before. Diluted loss per share was 21 cents. The year before, diluted loss per share was 20 cents.\n\nManagement recently announced a new office and research laboratory in Kyoto, Japan. This stepping stone into the Asia-Pacific market could help QuantumScape take advantage of the already thriving battery industry in Asia. Meanwhile, investors stateside are more than ready to see commercial production and revenues before too long.\n\nIn November 2021, QS stock hit a record high of $43.08. But the past six months, we have seen a different story and it is down 44.3% YTD. At present, the 12-month median forecast stands at $19. The market cap for QuantumScape is $5.21 billion.\n\nRomeo Power (RMO) An image of an EV charging with other icons imposed over top; a lightning bolt, full battery, cogs\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe final battery stock for today is Romeo Power (NYSE:RMO). It designs modular batteries for a variety of EV applications, ranging from delivery vans to long-haul trucks.\n\nIn early May, Romeo Power released Q1 financials. Revenue was $11.6 million, compared to $1.1 million the year before. Diluted loss per share was 60 cents.\n\nRecently, the company announced it’s become the sole provider of lithium-ion batteries for an undisclosed manufacturer’s new line of next generation low-speed electric vehicles (LSEVs). According to Romeo, their batteries were chosen specifically to meet the high-reliability requirements of the customer.\n\n7 REITs to Buy for the Second Half of 2022\n\nLike its peers, RMO stock has suffered in 2022 and is down close to 74%, dragging the market cap down to $132.7 million. Shares are changing hands 6.95 times trailing sales. Finally, the 12-month median forecast stands at $1.80.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Umeda disclosed ongoing robust demand for batteries at a post-results briefing, including the 2170 cells it supplies for Tesla’s electric vehicles. Umeda said, “We seeing continued strong demand from Tesla, for 2170 batteries, but also faster development of the 4680.” Panasonic CEO Yuki Kusumi looked to invest 600 billion yen ($4.6 billion) in automotive batteries, supply chain software, and other areas the company sees as core to its growth. Panasonic has been exploring sites in Oklahoma and Kansas for its multibillion-dollar factory to increase investment in EV cell production, and their proximity to the Tesla factory was critical for future growth. Panasonic looks to manufacture the bigger and more powerful 4680 batteries at its planned U.S. factory. Panasonic was betting on the newly-developed technology championed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk as the key to unlocking $25,000 EVs to open up doors to supply other automakers in addition to Tesla.

It’s also part of a broader push to increase the independence of its operating businesses, it said.\n\nPanasonic bought full control of the Scottsdale, Arizona-based Blue Yonder last year after taking a minority stake in 2020, in one of the largest acquisitions by a Japanese company recently. Blue Yonder, founded in 1985, makes supply-chain management software and uses artificial intelligence to predict product demand.\n\nIn a press conference after the announcement, Panasonic Chief Executive Officer Yuki Kusumi said he would consider taking the division public outside of Japan, perhaps in the US. He said the timing of the deal is difficult to predict, especially given recent tumult in global markets.\n\n“It’s hard to say now when we would be able to list the company because we just started mulling the idea,” he said. “But we hope to move as fast as we can because we’re aware speed is important. What units would be included into the new entity is one of many factors we will be considering.”\n\nA market listing would also be a way to reward and retain employees at Blue Yonder, which had already filed for its own IPO when Panasonic swooped in with the acquisition. At the time of the deal, Blue Yonder had more than 3,000 customers, including Best Buy Co., Coca-Cola Co. and Walmart Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nPanasonic announced the listing news after reporting earnings for the March quarter, including operating income that fell short of analyst estimates. It also forecast operating profit for the 2023 fiscal year that was shy of expectations.\n\nCEO Kusumi said it’s unlikely the company would consider a similar spinoff for the battery business that supplies Tesla.\n\n“We do not have any plans to list any other units of Panasonic, including the battery business,” he said.\n\n(Updates with CEO comments from fourth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMexico’s Hottest Resort Towns Struggle With Covid Travel Boom What Happened When a Wall Street Investment Giant Moved to Nashville Don’t Expect Chinese Stimulus to Save the Global Economy Major League Soccer Threatens to Replace the NHL as One of the Big Four US Sports Inflation Is So Bad Democrats Want Biden to ‘Do More’ for Midterms\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/panasonic-considers-us-ipo-blue-083657560.html","CCC3.F","CCC3.XETRA","COCA34.SA","KO.MX","KO.US","MAT1.F","MATA.F","PCRFF.US","PCRFY.US","TL0.F","TL0.XETRA","TSLA.MX","TSLA.US","TSLA34.SA","WALM34.SA","WMT.F","","","BLOOMBERG","PANASONIC","TESLA INC","YUKI KUSUMI","","","","","","","","","0.892","0.056","0.869","0.075"

Chief Executive Officer Yuki Kusumi said last month said that the company could not pass all those price increases on to customers.\n\nThe company has also been tackling continued shortages of components caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with strict lockdowns in China spurring concerns of further supply chain problems going forward.\n\nIn the three months to March 31 Panasonic posted operating profit of 83.3 billion yen compared with a profit of 31.8 billion yen a year ago.

As Economy Shifts","(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. and video game makers are emerging as rare beneficiaries of a weaker yen, which no longer offers the clear advantage to Japan’s corporate sector it did a decade ago.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nElon Musk Lands Deal to Take Twitter Private for $44 Billion ‘Weak Sauce’: Elon Musk’s 2018 Feud With Saudi Fund Revealed Anger in Japan as Ukraine Links Emperor Hirohito to Adolf Hitler Musk Nears $43 Billion Deal for Twitter as Soon as Monday Ketanji Brown Jackson Won’t Lose Her Seat If Breyer ‘Unretires’\n\nAutomakers and electronics makers including Sony Group Corp. once welcomed a softer yen for bolstering their competitiveness abroad and inflating the value of their repatriated profits. But after shifting production overseas in recent years to secure growth and resilient supply chains, many of them see a mixed, or mostly neutral, effect from the yen’s freefall to 20-year lows, according to industry executives and analysts.\n\nFor some consumer companies including Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing Co., the latest slump in the yen is a negative factor, exacerbating the impact of surging raw materials costs and higher energy prices amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\n“It’s no longer the case that the weak yen benefits many firms in the manufacturing sector,” Morningstar Research analyst Kazunori Ito said. “Even those who still benefit from the weak yen, the magnitude has become much smaller. Sony is a great example of that.”\n\nThe yen had its longest losing streak against the dollar in 50 years this month, as the gap widens between U.S. and Japanese interest rates. The Japanese currency has fallen around 10% against the U.S. dollar year to date, last trading on Tuesday at around 127.60 yen.\n\nSoftBank’s massive bets on overseas startups mean it is poised to clearly benefit from a weaker yen. The value of SoftBank’s assets will rise 9% if the yen weakens 12% year-on-year as the group has 86% of its value in dollar-linked assets, said Kirk Boodry, analyst at Redex Research. In a report published last week, he said the softer currency also helps SoftBank’s 1 trillion yen share buyback program announced in November, although it’s negative for the group’s debt.\n\nStory continues\n\nJapanese video game publishers such as Nintendo Co. and Capcom Corp. are also expected to benefit. Both companies create software in Japan, meaning a bulk of their costs are in yen, while a large portion of their sales come from overseas. Nintendo’s operating profit would increase by 1.1 billion yen per every 1 yen decline against the U.S. dollar, said Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities analyst Hirotoshi Murakami.\n\nKenjiro Asano, chief financial officer of video game publisher Koei Tecmo Holdings Corp., said on Monday that its operating profit may get a boost of over 100 million yen for each 1 yen fall.\n\nUpcoming business results should show Japanese automakers benefiting from a weaker currency, at least in accounting terms, analysts said.\n\n“Yen depreciation will partially offset Japan carmakers’ triple pain of ongoing virus outbreaks, parts shortages and higher input costs, combined with impact from the Russia-Ukraine war,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Tatsuo Yoshida. “Yen depreciation’s effect will vary by company, but should provide an overall boost to Japanese automakers’ operating profit,” he said, forecasting a particularly strong boost to Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.\n\nBut analysts and executives said the exchange rate’s impact was much smaller than it would have been a decade ago. A strong yen and supply chain disruptions from the earthquake and tsunami of 2011 prompted automakers and a broad range of suppliers to build a more resilient, global supply chain over the past decade. Stronger growth in overseas markets compared with sluggish demand in Japan also spurred a shift in production overseas.\n\nToyota’s top U.S. sales executive, Bob Carter noted that 77% of the vehicles sold in the U.S. last year were made in North America.\n\n“It doesn’t have the relevance in our business that it had 20 years ago,” he said.\n\nHonda Motor Co. is in a similar situation, according to Chief Executive Officer Toshihiro Mibe.\n\n“We operate under the basic principle of producing in the region where the market is,” he told Bloomberg News. “The business is operating in a way that makes it little impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates.”\n\nSatoru Aoyama, senior director of Asia-Pacific Corporates at Fitch Ratings, warned that supply chain constraints and chips shortages meant the year ahead could be harder for automakers.\n\n“The yen depreciation today and for the next six months, it’s like window-dressing, it doesn’t resolve the real, underlying issues,” he said.\n\nFor many Japanese manufacturers, the impact is expected to be more neutral. Panasonic Holdings Corp.’s CEO Yuki Kusumi said the negative impact on its home appliances business would cancel out gains in other areas.\n\nIn Sony’s case, the yen is likely a negative for its small smartphone business which is reliant on imports and sold mainly in Japan. Its image sensor business could see a boost as they are mostly made in Japan and sold to overseas customers, including smartphone makers like Apple Inc.\n\nIn some industries, the weaker yen is a clear negative, particularly among restaurant chains and others struggling with higher costs of imported foods and goods.\n\nEven Fast Retailing, whose casual clothing chain Uniqlo boasts a global sales and production structure, says the latest round of yen weakness is clearly negative due to higher import costs, particularly as a weak economy made it difficult to mark up prices in Japan.\n\n“There are no benefits from the weaker yen,” CEO Tadashi Yanai said earlier this month.\n\nThe 73-year-old, one of the most prominent executives in Japan explained the sharp currency move is squeezing companies like his between rising costs and reluctant consumers.\n\n“Given the current economic situation in Japan, we cannot easily raise product prices,” he said. “But when the cost of raw materials have doubled and tripled, it’s impossible to sell it at the current prices.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy Nasal Sprays Are Poised to Be the Next Weapon for Fighting Covid Shanghai’s Lockdown Missteps Undermine Financial Hub Ambitions Everything You Need to Know About Netflix’s Big Miss This Earnings Season Will Be a Weird One for Industrial Companies How WALL-E Predicted the Future\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-videogame-makers-rare-beneficiaries-003931599.html","300347.SHE","3635.TSE","6288.HK","8306.TSE","AAPL.US","DWD.F","DWD.XETRA","FR7.F","FRCOF.US","FRCOY.US","FUH.F","FUJHF.US","FUJHY.US","HDMA.F","HMC.US","","","","BLOOMBERG","JAPAN","SONY GROUP CORP","","","","","","","","","","-0.561","0.1","0.797","0.103"

"2022-04-14T10:59:27+00:00","Panasonic To Introduce Bigger EV Battery To Diversify Business From Tesla: FT","In an effort to diversify its business from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Panasonic Holdings (OTC: PCRFY) will roll out a bigger electric vehicle battery as the Company works to focus direction after a period of aggressive streamlining. Yuki Kusumi, Panasonic's CEO, said that the Company would invest ¥600 billion ($4.8 billion) over the next three years, with two-thirds earmarked for EV batteries, supply chain software, and air conditioners, reports Financial Times. The Company plans to introduce two production lines for the battery, which has a fivefold energy capacity compared with the current ones. Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has said the 4680, which is not scheduled for mass production until next year, will help bring down the price of a Tesla car to about $25,000. Tesla's Model 3 starts at about $41,000. For Panasonic, the battery represents an opportunity to diversify its client base from Tesla. ""If the 4680 is second to none in terms of performance and cost, manufacturers other than Tesla will eventually adopt it,"" said Kusumi. Kusumi's plans reflect Panasonic's desire to return to robust growth after aggressive streamlining under former president Kazuhiro Tsuga, who spent years shedding underperforming business lines, including the Company's famous plasma TVs. The remaining ¥200 billion for the next three years will be used for technology, including hydrogen energy.\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\nJPMorgan Reshuffles China Leadership To Tackle Slowing Growth: Bloomberg FDA Intends To Revoke Protagonist Therapeutics' Rusfertide Breakthrough Tag In Rare Form Of Blood Cancer\n\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

"2022-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","Panasonic Readies New Battery Tesla Sees as Key to $25,000 EVs","(Bloomberg) -- Panasonic Corp. is gearing up to become a major manufacturer of a new, more powerful battery championed by Tesla Inc. that the Japanese electronics maker says meets the demands of its high-flying customer.\n\nOver the past year and a half, Panasonic has been working to develop a bigger “4680” battery it intends to sell to the American electric carmaker. Because of the battery’s larger volume, fewer cells and related parts are needed to power an electric vehicle, leading Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk to tout the technology as the key to unlocking $25,000 EVs.\n\nDeveloping the new batteries has “taken an immense amount of stamina” over the past months, Kazuo Tadanobu, chief executive officer of Panasonic’s energy business, said at a recent interview at the company’s headquarters in Osaka.\n\nWhile a common inclination may be to look for ways to pack more energy into already existing cell sizes, changing the entire shape took “considerable nerve,” Tadanobu said, adding that “we didn’t know how they would be received.” Tesla, whose Model 3 starts at around $41,000 with tax incentives, has acknowledged that Panasonic’s new batteries are viable and meet the level of performance it’s seeking, according to the executive.\n\nPanasonic will start mass production of 4680 batteries in the fiscal year starting April 2023, with plans to establish two additional production lines as well as facilities at its Wakayama factory in western Japan. Ahead of that, the company is setting up a prototype production line for the batteries, also in Japan.\n\nThe push into next-generation batteries is a bold new step for the Japanese electronics giant. Even as it faced soaring demand for batteries from Tesla, Panasonic has been slower to build scale compared to rivals LG Energy Solution and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., instead touting the safety advantage of its cells and stressing that it prioritizes profits over market share.\n\nMore recently, signs have emerged that Panasonic may have lofty ambitions for its new battery. Last week, Japanese broadcaster NHK reported that the company is eying the construction of a new factory in the U.S. to supply Tesla with what will probably be 4680 cells.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith regard to a new factory, Tadanobu said that at this point nothing has been decided. The location of potential new plants will be evaluated based on partnerships and the economics of certain areas, he said, adding that for the time being Panasonic is focused on building a “solid foundation” for future 4680 production at its Wakayama plant in Japan.\n\nAnalysts, and even Musk himself, have warned of the difficulties associated with mass producing 4680 cells. The battery’s bigger size and design makes it more susceptible to particle contamination, a frequent cause of EV battery fires that occurs when minuscule metal pieces find their way into the center of a cell.\n\nTadanobu sees Panasonic’s attention to safety helping it maintain an edge going forward, even as Tesla moves to produce its own 4680 cells and other rivals are also rumored to be considering production. Panasonic’s advantage lies in its ability to “use craftsmanship to maintain safety even while raising the performance of a battery,” Tadanobu said. After leading development of the cells, Panasonic will work to retain its top spot, Tadanobu said. “We don’t want to lose.”\n\nUltimately, what’s behind Panasonic’s effort with the new batteries, according to Tadanobu, is a strong belief that the cells have the potential to change the world of transport. The 4680 battery will have a “considerable impact,” in helping lower the cost of EVs, enabling them to spread more widely, he said. That, in turn, promises to help lower carbon emissions around the globe, the CEO said.\n\nFrom an environmental perspective, “electrifying vehicles is the most impactful revolution that’s happening within our society,” Tadanobu said. Panasonic is working on 4680 batteries “because we see them as a new path forward,” he said.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/panasonic-readies-battery-tesla-sees-000000180.html","300750.SHE","373220.KO","MAT1.F","MATA.F","PCRFF.US","PCRFY.US","TL0.F","TL0.XETRA","TSLA.MX","TSLA.US","TSLA34.SA","","","","","","","","BLOOMBERG","JAPANESE ELECTRONICS","KAZUO TADANOBU","PANASONIC","TADANOBU","TESLA","","","","","","","0.991","0.027","0.879","0.094"
"2022-03-08T16:40:04+00:00","PCRFY vs. DLB: Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now?","Investors interested in Audio Video Production stocks are likely familiar with Panasonic Corp. (PCRFY) and Dolby Laboratories (DLB). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\n\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nPanasonic Corp. and Dolby Laboratories are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that PCRFY's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nPCRFY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.88, while DLB has a forward P/E of 18.72. We also note that PCRFY has a PEG ratio of 0.38. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. DLB currently has a PEG ratio of 1.44.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for PCRFY is its P/B ratio of 0.84. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, DLB has a P/B of 2.74.\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, PCRFY holds a Value grade of A, while DLB has a Value grade of D.\n\nPCRFY is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that PCRFY is likely the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

GPRO.\n\nIndustry: Audio-Video\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1862704/4-audio-video-stocks-that-are-braving-industry-challenges\n\nThe pandemic is still affecting companies in the Zacks Audio Video Production industry. Declining consumer demand and supply chain disruptions pose major concerns. Also, fierce competition from importers of comparatively low-priced devices weighs on these industry players. Online accessibility of recording equipment and the availability of distribution channels on the Internet remain headwinds.\n\nNonetheless, the companies are concentrating on the premium segment of the branded products market for business growth. Panasonic Corp., Sharp Corp., Sonos, Inc. and GoPro, Inc. are likely to benefit from investments in cutting-edge technology solutions that create better communications experience.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThis industry includes developers, manufacturers and sellers of audio, visual, and infotainment systems like Harman International Industries, Incorporated (HAR)\n\nWhat's Shaping the Future of Audio Video Production Industry\n\nAggressive Competition: In the United States, smart-connected televisions, microphones and speaker enclosures are the most popular electronic devices among customers. But the U.S. manufacturers of audio and video systems continue to face intense competition from importers of comparatively low-priced devices, particularly from China, Vietnam and Mexico.\n\nThe firms face stiff competition across all end markets, which often leads to intense price wars and margin contraction. Also, a decline in picture and music sales has taken a heavy toll on the industry. Nevertheless, the companies are likely to benefit from investments in cutting-edge technology solutions that create a seamless communications experience.\n\nStory continues\n\nChanging Consumer Preferences: Rapid changes due to the technological obsolescence of products lead to a plethora of challenges as the ecosystem continues to transform in the digital age. The fast-evolving industry has called for innovation, which necessitates the participants to continuously come up with ground-breaking technology to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nKeeping up with changing consumer preferences, licensee demand, shifting standards makes the industry vulnerable to operating risks. While the companies are coming up with compelling offerings to broaden their customer base, they face risks associated with new product development.\n\nPandemic Continues to Hurt Businesses: The pandemic continues to deal a blow to the industry, with companies seeing a substantial decline in cinema product sales. Theater closures and lower sales for television productions are impairing the overall performance. While the companies keep investing for market share gains and supply chain resilience, a shortage of critical hardware components due to supply chain disruptions is expected to hurt their revenues in the near term.\n\nUnit volume shipments across end markets and devices are expected to decline. Fluctuations in commodity pricing for different components pose another concern.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Audio Video Production industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It currently has a Zacks Industry Rank #192, which places it at the bottom 24% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates weak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is an outcome of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since July 2021, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year and the next have decreased 2.8% and 5%, respectively.\n\nBefore we present a few audio-video production stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Outperforms Sector, Lags S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Audio Video Production industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector but lagged the S&P 500 composite in the past year.\n\nThe industry has lost 9.1% over this period against the S&P 500’s rise of 15.3%.

"2022-02-03T18:46:04+00:00","Toshiba’s Continued Resistance to Corporate Governance Seen in Rise of Executive – Document","By John Jannarone\n\nDespite years of scandal, a flagging share price and reported offers to take the company private at a premium, Japanese conglomerate Toshiba Corp. (6502.T) continues to embrace a culture that puts senior management first at the expense of shareholders, according to an English translation of a documentreviewed by CorpGov.\n\nThe original document, which has been published widely in the Japanese financial media at publications including Nikkei BP, explains that even after the resignation of former CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani, senior executives have protected each other rather than seriously entertaining change at the company.\n\nIn particular, the document focuses on Corporate Senior Executive Vice President Mamoru Hatazawa, who has been at Toshiba since 1984 and some see as current leadership’s choice to become the next CEO. The document indicates that Mr. Hatazawa is both too similar to past leaders and that he himself has contributed to the company’s current woes directly through involvement in multiple scandals.\n\nToshiba’s website shows that Mr. Hatazawa became Vice President, Nuclear Energy Systems & Services Division, Power Systems Company in 2014. The document points out that in that role, Mr. Hatazawa was responsible for the Kanagawa Heavy Particle Beam Therapy Project and Tomari Nuclear Power Plant Project. In both situations, orders that were received at a loss were allegedly hidden, and cost increase recognition was postponed.\n\nThe document also points out that Mr. Hatazawa oversaw the acquisition of the engineering company Stone & Webster in 2015, which led to a major strain on Toshiba’s balance sheet. Most recently, the document criticizes Mr. Hatazawa for inaction around the TEPCO SCADA scandal, which contributed to further losses.\n\nTaken altogether, there is a great concern that Mr. Hatazawa embraces an inward-looking “mura” culture borne out of many years of experience in the nuclear division. The document describes Mr. Hatazawa and his closest allies as “village elders” who are unwilling to diversify viewpoints and may appoint yes-men to secure their stronghold. Such a mindset will potentially inhibit any real progress at turning the company around or entertaining constructive outside proposals – especially any going-private transaction.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom line: Mr. Hatazawa doesn’t have a broad corporate experience. He’s been too focused on nuclear technology and not enough on M&A or positive restructuring. He definitely a has a key relationship with Japan’s Ministry of Economy Trade & Industry (METI) and management is pushing the notion that Toshiba would lose government contracts if it went private. But there are many private companies with government contracts in Japan.\n\nTIMELINE\n\n2015 – Toshiba Corp. (6502.T) accounting scandal resulting in CEO Tanaka’s resignation 2016/2017 – Westinghouse scandal and bankruptcy 2021 – CEO Kurumatani resigns, Chairman Nagayama removed at AGM 2021 – Announcement of three-way split 2021 – Multiple media reports indicate private equity bids at ¥6,000+/share for Toshiba\n\nToshiba said on Nov. 12 it will split itself into three units by spinning off its energy and infrastructure division as well as its device and storage business. The fact that senior management considers its plan bold highlights the gulf in thinking between Toshiba executives and the company’s investors.\n\nToshiba didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nToshiba’s “IR Day” scheduled for Feb. 7-8, when senior executives are expected to present to investors. Members of the Japanese financial community interviewed by CorpGov say they expect “fireworks” at next week’s event.\n\nContact:\n\neditor@corpgov.com\n\nwww.CorpGov.com\n\nEditor@CorpGov.com\n\nTwitter: @CorpGovernor","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/toshiba-continued-resistance-corporate-governance-184604003.html","HIA1.F","HTHIF.US","HTHIY.US","MAT1.F","MATA.F","PCRFF.US","PCRFY.US","TOSBF.US","TOSYY.US","TSE1.F","","","","","","","","","CEO NOBUAKI KURUMATANI","SENIOR EXECUTIVES","SENIOR MANAGEMENT","TOSHIBA","","","","","","","","","0.854","0.068","0.848","0.084"
"2022-02-02T10:54:14+00:00","Panasonic to Start Production of Tesla-Championed 4680 Batteries","(Bloomberg) — Panasonic Corp. is renovating a facility in Japan to start testing mass production of a new type of lithium-ion battery that’s championed by Tesla Inc. as the key to unlocking cheaper electric vehicles.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAlphabet Stock Split Aimed at Bringing Google Shares to Masses Teen Who Demanded $50,000 From Elon Musk Is Now Targeting More Billionaire Jets SeaWorld Makes $3.4 Billion Takeover Bid for Cedar Fair Be Warned — the Turbulence This Time Is Different Covid-Infected HIV Patient Developed Mutations, Study Shows\n\nPanasonic will start prototype production of a next-generation “4680” battery early this year at a facility in Japan’s western Wakayama Prefecture, Chief Financial Officer Hirokazu Umeda said Wednesday at a briefing on the company’s quarterly financial results.\n\nThe Wakayama facility will first be used for pilot production of the 4680 cells. After various tests, a mass production line will be newly installed, likely also in Wakayama, Umeda said.\n\nSeparately, Panasonic posted an operating profit of 73 billion yen ($640 million) for the recently ended quarter, falling short of analysts’ average forecast for 107 billion yen as its consumer electronics business was hit by increased material prices.\n\nThe 4680 batteries — named after their dimensions of a 46-millimeter diameter and 80-millimeter height — hold more than five times the capacity of the smaller 1865 and 2170 cells Panasonic currently supplies to Tesla. This means that fewer cells and related parts are needed in an EV, which in turn has the potential to lower its overall cost.\n\nThe 4680 battery was first unveiled by Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer, at an event in 2020. Musk touted the batteries as a “massive breakthrough” in cell technology that will make it possible for his company to produce EVs that sell for $25,000.\n\nRead More: Panasonic Bets on Tesla ‘Beer Can’ Battery to Unlock $25,000 EVs\n\nWhile Tesla plans to make the cells in-house, it has asked Panasonic to begin producing them as well. The Japanese company has said it will seek to sell the batteries to EV makers other than just Tesla.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor now, with regard to 4680 batteries Panasonic is “receiving strong requests from Tesla,” Umeda said Wednesday. “We’ll first prioritize supplying Tesla once the verifications are complete,” he said.\n\nAnalysts had cautioned that the new 4680 cells could prove difficult to mass-produce given that their size can lead to safety issues such as overheating. Umeda said Wednesday the company’s initial tests resulted in a “performance-satisfying prototype” of the new cell.\n\nThe electronics maker’s decision to designate a domestic site for its 4680 cell production comes after it struggled to expand production at the Gigafactory plant it jointly operates with Tesla in Nevada. The 4680 production site is close to Panasonic’s corporate headquarters in Osaka, allowing it to easily dispatch veteran engineers to fine-tune its machinery.\n\nBattery rivals such as LG Energy Solution and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. are also stepping up investment to beef up their capacity. Compared with other EV battery heavyweights, Panasonic has been slow to build scale, instead touting the safety advantage of its batteries and stressing that it prioritizes profit over market share.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nRent Inflation Shows That Landlords Have the Upper Hand Again China’s Local Governments Are at Risk of a Puerto Rico Moment China’s American-Born Olympic Star Is Being Very Careful First Black Woman Picked for Fed Draws GOP Fire Over Research Nurses Who Faced Lawsuits for Quitting Are Fighting Back\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/panasonic-start-production-tesla-championed-105414215.html","300750.SHE","373220.KO","MAT1.F","MATA.F","PCRFF.US","PCRFY.US","TL0.F","TL0.XETRA","TSLA.MX","TSLA.US","TSLA34.SA","","","","","","","","BLOOMBERG","HIROKAZU UMEDA","PANASONIC","PROTOTYPE PRODUCTION","TESLA","WAKAYAMA PREFECTURE","","","","","","","0.954","0.044","0.884","0.072"

(NASDAQ:TSLA), is gaining attention from institutional investors.\n\nHere is what Massif Capital has to say about Lithium Americas Corp. in their Q1 2021 investor letter:\n\n“Lithium Americas: The volatility noted above in LAC has resulted in solid returns via our options trades around our core equity position. At the current time, we are short calls on LAC, as we have done multiple times throughout the position’s life, expiring on May 21, 2021, at a $17.5 and $22.5 strike price. The volume of contracts sold at each strike corresponds to the size of the equity position we want should the calls expire in the money, and the underlying equity gets called away from us. The thought process behind this trade construction is that if we know the size of the position we want at a particular price point, there is no reason not to accumulate additional returns by pre-selling the stock we would have sold anyway.\n\nHigh levels of volatility positively impact the price of options, increasing the premium we can earn from selling covered calls. To date, we have sold covered calls on LAC that have expired worthless four times, yielding a roughly 7% return on the equity position’s current value or 71bps for the portfolio overall. The outstanding covered calls appear to be trending towards a similar worthless expiration. If they do, the covered call trades on LAC will result in us owning the shares with committed capital of -$0.28 per share.\n\nAlthough we believe in the fullness of time LAC warrants a $30+ valuation, the prices achieved in early January of this year were not justified by the underlying fundamentals. Some will argue we should have sold down our position. We had already established our option positions and believe LAC is an emerging major in the lithium mining industry. Thus, we decided to maintain the position unchanged. Although still relatively high, the current $15 per share valuation is not crazy compared to where we think the firm should be trading based on fundamentals, so we are no longer overly concerned with the position as is.\n\nLAC management also took advantage of the volatility issuing stock on January 22 for $22 a share. The ~$400 million in proceeds will be used to develop Thacker Pass, the US-based clay lithium deposit, which will likely be the largest producing Lithium mine in America when turned on. In our opinion, the stock issuance could not have come at a better time. LAC management has advanced the project through various development stages (de-risking), but with the share issuance, they have significantly reduced the need to bring in an outside partner to develop the asset as the first phase of the project is expected to cost roughly $581 million. After-tax and at an 8% discount rate, the Thacker Pass project’s present value is approximately $2.6 billion (the firm’s current market capitalization is $1.5 billion). Although the share issuance was dilutive, increasing the total shares by 17%, we believe it will, in the long run, prove a forward-looking, value-additive decision by management.\n\nThe lithium market remains an area of interest and focus for us. This reflects our belief that the most exciting investment opportunities to capture secular trends in EV’s and batteries are found upstream in the mining industry. It is also a reflection that there is a greater diversity of lithium investment opportunities relative to other battery metals.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best EV Battery Stocks To Invest In.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Best EV Charging Stocks to Buy Now 15 Most Valuable Data Companies in the World 10 Stocks Drawing Attention Post Quarterly Results\n\nDisclosure: None. 10 Best EV Battery Stocks To Invest Inis originally published on Insider Monkey.","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-ev-battery-stocks-140335019.html","8GM.F","DCRC.US","F.MX","F.US","FDMO34.SA","FMC1.F","FMC1.XETRA","GM.MX","GM.US","GMCO34.SA","LAC.TO","LAC.US","MAT1.F","MATA.F","","","","","BATTERY MANUFACTURER","BATTERY MANUFACTURERS","CONTEMPORARY AMPEREX TECHNOLOGY CO","ELECTRIC VEHICLES","FORD MOTOR COMPANY","GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY","INC","LIMITED","PANASONIC CORPORATION","TESLA","TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION","VOLKSWAGEN AG","0.998","0.013","0.908","0.079"
"2022-01-10T06:07:24+00:00","Japan’s Panasonic Joins Global Trend Toward Four-Day Week","(Bloomberg) -- Panasonic Corp. is introducing an optional four-day work week, one of a small but growing number of Japanese companies joining the global trend to encourage a good work-life balance.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCypriot Scientist Says Deltacron Covid Variant Isn’t Error Cyprus Finds Covid-19 Infections That Combine Delta and Omicron World’s Biggest Crypto Fortune Began With a Friendly Poker Game Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Tests Positive for Covid-19 Omicron Study in South Africa Points to End of Acute Pandemic Phase\n\nEmployees of the Osaka-based electronics conglomerate can take up side jobs and spend time on local volunteer work on their extra days off, Chief Executive Officer Yuki Kusumi said in an investor briefing last week.\n\n“Our responsibility is to strike an ideal balance between the work style and life style for our diverse human capital,” Kusumi said. Panasonic will also let employees work from home when their partners are transferred to other locations, he said.\n\nPanasonic’s move is in line with actions by technology companies worldwide that are trying to attract talent in a tight job market by offering a shorter week. Amazon.com Inc. piloted a four-day week for select employees in 2018, and consumer-goods giant Unilever Plc in December 2020 started a yearlong trial of the shortened week for its New Zealand staff. Countries such as Ireland and Iceland are also trying it out.\n\nIn Japan, a group of lawmakers are discussing a proposal to grant employees a day off in addition to the two break days a week, to protect their well-being. But companies allowing four-day weeks are still a small minority: just over 8% of Japanese firms offered more than two guaranteed days off, according to a survey conducted in 2020 by the labor ministry.\n\nThat may be changing. Drug maker Shionogi & Co., which is developing an oral Covid-19 treatment, will provide the option for three days off per week from April, according to a Nikkei newspaper report. Yahoo Japan Corp. and Sompo Himawari Life Insurance Inc. also allow four-day weeks to staff caring for children or aging relatives, the Nikkei reported.\n\nStory continues\n\n(Adds CEO quote in third paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jessica Simpson Almost Lost Her Name The Lost Girls of Covid The Former NSA Official Vying to Steer Biden’s Cyber Policy Prescription Weight Loss Drugs Are Working, If You Can Get One Wall Street Loves China More Than Ever\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japan-panasonic-joins-global-trend-060724611.html","AMZ.F","AMZ.XETRA","AMZN.MX","AMZN.US","AMZO34.SA","MAT1.F","MATA.F","PCRFF.US","PCRFY.US","UL.US","ULEV34.SA","ULN.MX","ULVR.LSE","UNA.AS","UNIN.XETRA","UNLYF.US","","","BLOOMBERG","JAPAN","PANASONIC","YUKI KUSUMI","","","","","","","","","0.991","0.032","0.851","0.118"
"2022-01-06T19:00:00+00:00","Panasonic’s big news coming out at CES 2022","Panasonic North America’s CEO Megan Myungwon Lee sat down with Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley to discuss what to expect from Panasonic at CES 2022, the company’s developments in the automotive industry, and how they are tackling supply chain shortages.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nDAN HOWLEY: This is Yahoo Finance's coverage of CES 2020 presented by Verizon. I'm Dan Howley. And we're here with Panasonic CEO of North America Megan Lee. Megan, thank you so much for joining us. Obviously, CES 2022, kind of a big change than what we're normally used to.\n\nOriginally, it was supposed to be sort of physical and then virtual. And now it's just essentially largely virtual at this point. But I just want to kind of get your thoughts going into CES, what Panasonic's biggest announcements were for this year's show, and what you're looking forward to most.\n\nMEGAN MYUNGWON LEE: Thank you for inviting me. We're very excited to be part of CES again. And like you said, more virtually. But we do have physical presence that those of you who are already there, please go visit our booth. We have great immersive entertainment showcase that should be a lot of fun. So that's one area that we're showcasing.\n\nThe other part that we're really excited to show is you mentioned automotive. We are, in US, number eight tier one supplier and globally 15. And we have a lot of exciting going on in automotive areas. Number one, we're announcing AR HUD 2.0 with eye tracking system, which is really exciting. And the second is I talked about immersive theater-like entertainment system that we're partnering with Area 15.\n\nAnd we also, of course, are showcasing a lot of consumer electronics products. That's part of our DNA. And last but not least, we're also showing the partnership that we have with the Olympian, the legend, swimmer Katie Ledecky about STEM education. We feel very strongly about giving back to the community. So those are the outline of our CES 2022.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: I want to focus on the HUD for a second, which is basically a heads-up display for vehicles. It'll show things like directions or if someone is in front of you that you may or may not be able to easily see, such as bikers in traffic or something like that. Where do you see that going as far as the future for the HUD? And when do you think something like this will be available for the average consumer?\n\nStory continues\n\nMEGAN MYUNGWON LEE: So we're showcasing in addition to what we showed last year. This year, we're introducing the eye tracking system. That's really interesting. And what it does is-- what I try to understand is, I try to put myself as an average consumer and really try to understand the technology.\n\nSo what it really does is, when you sit in your driver's seat, it adjusts for your height. And it also monitors your movement. So it adjusts your height. And then it optimizes your optical path. And then it auto-focus for you. And then it also senses your movement to make sure that your safety is ensured.\n\nWe're partnering with a company called VR. It's a startup based in LA. And we're very excited about it. And we're hoping to show it to the average consumer very soon.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: And I guess when you look past-- and you talk about the work that you're doing with Katie Ledecky and STEM. What is Panasonic specifically bringing to the table there? And is it part of the need for more people working in STEM? How is that playing out?\n\nMEGAN MYUNGWON LEE: So Panasonic, with our 100-plus years of history, in US, we're here for more than 60 years. And as part of long-term strategy is make sure that we grow with the everyday consumer and as a company, and we continue to give back to the society and stay relevant.\n\nWhat we feel strongly about for Panasonic and also Panasonic foundation-- and that's why it was a perfect partnership with Katie Ledecky-- is the STEM education is really more and more important. 79% of new jobs since 1990 was from STEM-based, where only 34% job creation is for any other jobs. So we feel very strongly about it.\n\nAnd also, we're a technology company. So all that investment that we can make will grow up to be part of our employment. And we can grow with the young talent together as a company. So we're really, really excited about it. And Katie Ledecky is just wonderful to work with.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: We've just been discussing the chip shortage all year. Well, 2021, last year. We'll discuss it, I'm sure, well into 2022. But I guess for your CES plans and for how you're able to kind of understand your product cycle and your product line, how has that impacted Panasonic? And how are you kind of working around that?\n\nMEGAN MYUNGWON LEE: Right. So as if a pandemic was not hard enough, we're hit with so many different challenges, including the parts supply issues and supply chain management. So we're trying to manage it. And there are several things that we're trying to do.\n\nEnsuring the customer, that we support the customer is the priority for us. And sometimes, for different businesses, we had to make the investment of buying more supplies than we usually have to have. So that's one thing we tried to do.\n\nAnother area that we're really excited about is we acquired Blue Yonder. It is about autonomous supply chain management. So that's also part that we're not only offering that as a business. That should help our company as Panasonic Global as well. That's really exciting.\n\nAnother supply chain issue that we're trying to monitor is Panasonic is big in sustainability. And one of our larger business is EV battery. We have a factory up in Reno. It's a young company. It's only five, six years old. And I get really excited when I talk about that, because I remember when I used to visit that location with the trailers. And now we have 4,500 employees producing 2 billion batteries a year.\n\nAnd I was talking to Alan Swann, the company president of that unit. And he said it's 60 batteries a second. Imagine that, right? And with that business, we're also partnering with Redwood Material on domestic supply, circular supply chain. So that's also something that we're doing as well.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Well, thank you so much, Megan Lee, Panasonic's CEO of North America. We really appreciate your time.\n\nMEGAN MYUNGWON LEE: Of course. Thank you so much.","https://finance.yahoo.com/video/panasonic-big-news-coming-ces-190000807.html","MAT1.F","MATA.F","PCRFF.US","PCRFY.US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DAN HOWLEY","KATIE LEDECKY","PANASONIC","","","","","","","","","","0.999","0.003","0.864","0.133"
"2021-12-30T14:00:00+00:00","CES Comeback Effort Stymied After Omicron Spooks Participants","(Bloomberg) -- Next week was meant to mark a key moment for the tech world, with executives from some of the biggest companies descending on CES in Las Vegas to hobnob, share strategies and remember what life was like before the pandemic.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nGhislaine Maxwell Found Guilty in Win for Epstein Victims Mercedes Swept Up in China Internet Furor Over Models’ Eyes Apple Aims to Prevent Defections to Meta With Rare $180,000 Bonuses for Top Talent The Senator Who Could Rescue Biden’s Agenda Covid With Omicron Isn’t ‘Same Disease,’ Oxford Scientist Says\n\nInstead, most of them will be attending the event remotely -- if at all. The annual gathering will soldier on in-person, but with just a diehard contingent venturing to Vegas. Companies like Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Intel Corp. scrapped plans to go, and many of the show’s presentations have shifted online. Tech news outlets also have dropped out.\n\nCES was held virtually last January, and the hope was to bring back the good old days this time around. The massive show, with millions of square feet of exhibit space, attracted more than 170,000 people per year before the pandemic. But the rapid spread of Covid-19’s omicron variant in December, which sent global cases above 1 million a day, foiled CES’s comeback bid.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. was one of the latest companies to skip a trip to Las Vegas, saying Tuesday that face-to-face meetings would be held virtually “in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, partners and communities.” Mike Sievert, chief executive officer of CES sponsor T-Mobile US Inc., canceled his keynote speech altogether.\n\nPanasonic Corp. scaled back its plans as well this week. It will still have a few staffers onsite at the show, but its press conference will be online.\n\nDespite the exodus, CES organizers have steadfastly defended holding an in-person show. According to the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on the event, more than 2,200 exhibitors were still committed to coming as of Wednesday. Gary Shapiro, the group’s CEO, said last week that canceling the show would hurt the smaller companies and entrepreneurs that count on the event to pitch ideas.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe conference also is enforcing health precautions, such as a vaccination requirement, masking and the use of Covid-19 tests.\n\n“CES will and must go on,” Shapiro said in a post on LinkedIn. “It will have many more small companies than large ones. It may have big gaps on the show floor. Certainly, it will be different from previous years. It may be messy. But innovation is messy.”\n\nCES bills itself as the most influential tech event in the world, and the 54-year-old gathering has debuted many of the biggest electronic products -- from the VCR in 1970 to compact disc players in 1981 to Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox in 2001.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co. used the event to launch its first 100-inch plasma TV, and the 2009 conference introduced the Palm Pre, a device touted as an iPhone killer. The iPhone survived the threat.\n\nIn the early 2010s, the conference was home to technologies like 3D TVs, new phones from Samsung, and several Android tablets that were designed to challenge Apple Inc.’s iPad. But after that period, the show’s appeal to technology giants started to cool. Microsoft stopped making major announcements in 2012 at CES, and Samsung turned its attention to the Mobile World Congress and stand-alone, Apple-style product launches. In 2020, the company used CES to introduce the Ballie robotic ball, a product that ultimately fizzled.\n\nMore recently, CES saw a bit of a resurgence. Amazon and Google spent money on booths to tout their smart home initiatives, and major automotive companies started filling up Las Vegas convention-center halls with their future models and technologies. Even Apple, which hadn’t officially taken part in CES since 1992, showed up in 2020 for a panel about privacy. But attendance slipped from more than 184,000 in January 2017 to about 171,000 in January 2020, just before the pandemic.\n\nBeyond product announcements, CES has been key for behind-the-scenes meetings and deals. It gives companies a chance to investigate and acquire new technologies that they may add to their product lines.\n\nThat’s harder to do with an online panel or Zoom conference call, and virtual attendees can’t touch and feel new products.\n\nBut the conference will still serve as a showcase for buzzy new technologies, including self-driving vehicles and artificial intelligence. Samsung is poised to introduce new TVs and a phone. Sony Group Corp. will usher in their latest entertainment devices, and Qualcomm Inc. will talk up advances in chips.\n\nExecutives from Intel, General Motors Co. and Procter & Gamble Co. are slated to give speeches or media presentations as well -- all of which will be available online.\n\nCES also will highlight the technologies behind the metaverse -- a vision of interconnected online worlds that rely on virtual and augmented reality. Facebook, which changed its name to Meta Platforms Inc. earlier this year, is the biggest champion of the concept.\n\nMeta had planned to send people to CES, which will have exhibitor space devoted to so-called extended reality.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Meta didn’t take long to choose the virtual option instead. When omicron concerns began to mount last week, it was one of the first big tech companies to pull out.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow to ‘See’ Time: The Secret to Peak Entrepreneur Productivity Stop With the Covid Excuses, Already—Customers Have Caught On How Shopify Outfoxed Amazon to Become the Everywhere Store What Really Happens When Workers Are Given a Flexible Hybrid Schedule?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the Japanese economy and these stocks, go directly to the5 Best Japanese Stocks to Buy Right Now.\n\nOriginating from the third largest economy in the world, Japanese companies are some of the leading contributors to world GDP. Even though the COVID-19 pandemic slowed the economic momentum of an export-reliant Japan due to broken global supply chains, the Japanese stocks are slowly recovering after the impressive vaccine rollout in Japan and other major countries.\n\nThe COVID-19 pressures delayed Japan’s economic recovery even heading into Q3 2021, but as of November this year, Japan’s vaccination rates have reached 75% of the population, and all restrictions on the economy have finally been lifted, which means that better days are ahead for Japanese companies, at least in the short-term.\n\nJapan's Economic Outlook\n\nThe Q3 annualized GDP for Japan fell by 3%, as compared to a forecasted decline of 0.8%. Consumption fell 1.1% in July-September, and domestic demand was responsible for a 0.9% drop in GDP. In the current quarter, consumer activity is picking up, and auto output is improving, so analysts expect Japan's economy to expand an annualized 5.1%.\n\nThe Japanese government has planned to implement a stimulus package worth trillions of yens, prioritizing the chip industry and the country’s digital growth, yet market researchers believe that the package will help in the medium- to long-term, rather than relieve immediate economic pressure.\n\nJapan lost 2.1% of its exports in July-September as trade was impacted by chip shortages and supply chain constraints. Real GDP is not expected to reach pre-pandemic levels until the second half of 2023, and the stimulus package will result in a 1% to 2% growth in the Japanese economy after Q2 2022, since exports remain uncertain.\n\nJapanese analysts expect exports to recover largely by the first three months into 2022, and the auto industry is set for recovery since chip manufacturers have expanded production, supply chains are slowly regaining pre-pandemic momentum, and foot traffic has nearly returned to 2019 levels. It is high time to keep an eye out for Japanese stocks, which are surely recovering yet current valuation might offer attractive entry points into these multinational corporations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe most notable Japanese stocks according to our extensive research include Panasonic Corporation (OTC:PCRFY), Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE:HMC), Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), and Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), among others discussed in detail below.\n\nPhoto by Lenny Kuhne on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWith this context in mind, we selected the top Japanese stocks based on mostly positive news surrounding each company, determining their caliber according to analyst ratings, earnings for the period ending September 2021 and long-term growth catalysts.

"2021-12-03T18:09:40+00:00","7 Japan Stocks to Buy as U.S. Dollar Inflation Soars Higher","When history looks back at the impact of the novel coronavirus, the most apt description of this era will be “surreal.” During the early days of the crisis, major metropolitan areas from Los Angeles to New York fell deafeningly silent. But the economy also suffered its fair share of unprecedented circumstances, one of which is leading to an intriguing case for Japan stocks to buy.\n\nAs you know, inflation has soared, leading many consumers to buy goods and services now since the dollar will likely be worth less in the future. Yet at the same time, dollar strength has only grown more robust. What gives? According to the Wall Street Journal, rising prices have opened the door for the Federal Reserve to end monetary stimulus, presenting a compelling albeit risky argument for Japan stocks to buy.\n\nPrimarily — and all other things being equal — American consumers can purchase more goods from exporting nations. Considering that retail revenge has spurred substantial increases in spending to make up for a lost year in 2020, this narrative bodes well for Japan stocks. Additionally, every nation is eager to bounce back from the pandemic. The rising dollar happens to benefit exporters at just the right time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnother factor to consider is that the Japanese yen presently looks weak. While you shouldn’t put too much emphasis on technical (chart) analysis and ignore other conditions, the yen is currently trending well below multi-year averages. It appears, though this is no guarantee, that the currency is charting a bearish pennant formation, which implies downward action. Cynically, this could benefit Japan stocks.\n\n7 Best Robinhood Stocks to Buy That Pay Monthly Dividends\n\nFurther, the underlying nation has been societally stable, getting a firm grip on the Covid-19 pandemic. Of course, anything can change, especially with the unknowns associated with the omicron variant.

Further, other nations can encounter their own specific issues, which may negative the impact of favorable currency fluctuations. Therefore, due diligence and money management maintain their importance.\n\nJapan Stocks to Buy: Sony (SONY) Sony logo on the side of a building at its offices in Silicon Valley.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis is going to seem self-serving, but I’ve got to go with Sony as the best idea to consider among Japan stocks. No, it doesn’t have anything to do with the fact that I worked there previously. And no, while I do own SONY shares — and probably will hold onto a core position for a very long time — my personal holdings did not factor into my analysis.\n\nRather, amid the general decline in popularity for Japanese consumer electronics over the last several years, Sony has been the rare animal that has gone against the grain. Specifically, its PlayStation video game console continues to churn out impressive sales performances. I’d add that the company’s entertainment unit kept the lights on during Sony’s struggles in other business categories.\n\nBut with the new normal, the urgency to own the latest PS5 console has soared into unprecedented territory. I haven’t had time to play video games in recent years but from what I can tell, these things are flying off the shelves.\n\nAdd in the pressure to buy accessories — you never know when they’ll be back in stock again — and you have in SONY one of the best Japan stocks to hedge the rising greenback (and pretty much anything else).\n\nNintendo (NTDOY) A yellow Switch Lite from Nintendo (NTDOY) sits in front of a bright pink background.\n\nSource: ESOlex / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn my research regarding family friendly gaming giant Nintendo, I came across a story regarding a failed attempt by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to buy out the company. Back in 1999 — two years before the software stalwart launched its Xbox console — Microsoft executives set up a meeting to discuss the buyout deal.\n\nApparently, from one of the witnesses, Nintendo’s team just laugh their you-know-whats off. Per former Microsoft third-party relations head Kevin Bachus, “Like, imagine an hour of somebody just laughing at you. That was kind of how that meeting went.”\n\nTo commemorate the failed effort — but mainly to celebrate the Xbox’s 20-year anniversary — Microsoft shared the letter it sent to Nintendo. I guess folks can laugh about it now but that must have hurt at the time.\n\n7 Stocks to Buy to Hedge Against Rising Oil Prices\n\nOh well, the non-deal gave investors added opportunities to hedge the rising dollar with Japan stocks. With NTDOY, astute gamers understand that Nintendo — while it lacks the sheer branding power of PlayStation — has a tremendous following. That was the case in last year’s holiday season and I don’t see any indicators why this year will be any different.\n\nJapan Stocks to Buy: Toyota (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough I generally have positive sentiment for automotive behemoth Toyota, the Covid-19 pandemic adds a perplexing crosswind to the narrative. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, revenue slipped 8.8% against the prior year’s result. This time around, it only needs a mediocre performance in the fourth quarter to match fiscal year 2020’s tally.\n\nThe issue, of course, is the global supply chain. Through no fault of their own, automakers are incurring gross inefficiencies in their sales. Plenty of buyers exists, as evidenced by still soaring demand for used vehicles. It’s just that with the added headwind of the semiconductor shortage, Toyota (and others) are not able to feed demand.\n\nAgain, that’s not a problem affecting any one automaker. However, the pandemic may also provide a clear advantage for Toyota. Thanks to decades of superior craftsmanship and innovative manufacturing processes, Toyota has earned a reputation for value and reliability. During an unpredictable period, reliability should command a hefty premium.\n\nAlso, the value component is also on everyone’s radar. Once these factors fade away, car valuations should plunge back to normal. But when that happens, Toyotas should retain more of their value, making TM one of the intriguing Japan stocks to buy.\n\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) A sign outside of a Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) Bank shows the company's logo.\n\nSource: Ned Snowman / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the riskier Japan stocks to buy, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group isn’t exactly a bastion of confidence. Sure, MUFG shares are up nearly 24% on a year-to-date basis. Nevertheless, over the trailing five years, the equity unit is down 13%.\n\nTo put this sorry performance into perspective, U.S. counterpart JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is up 95% in the same period. And if what the experts say is true — never bet against America — then JPM could continue moving higher.\n\n7 Tech Stocks That Could Rally In December\n\nOn the flipside, Charles Schwab noted in late September that Japanese firms feature the best upward earnings revisions trend of all major countries. If so, this should augur well for Japan stocks generally and MUFG specifically.\n\nJapan Stocks to Buy: Panasonic (PCRFY) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing/Shutterstock.com\n\nIf Mitsubishi UFJ was a tough proposition for Japan stocks to buy given the longstanding challenges affecting the underlying economy, then you may want to brace yourself with Panasonic’s inclusion. While a generally popular name over the last several years due to its technologies for electric vehicle batteries, Panasonic suffered one of the unfortunate hallmarks of life in the information age — a cyber attack.\n\nPer a press release dated Nov. 26, Panasonic disclosed that its network was “illegally accessed by a third party.” This breach occurred on Nov. 11, which involved the accessing of “some data on a file server.” However, upon further investigation, TechCrunch confirmed through a Panasonic spokesperson that the breach began on June 22 and wasn’t noticed until Nov. 11.\n\nThat’s a lot to digest, but needless to say, investors weren’t happy with the tech firm’s apparently shoddy cybersecurity infrastructure. Over the trailing week, PCRFY is down more than 9%. With the noise from the omicron variant and its global impact, shares could slip further.\n\nThen again, if you have a longer-term outlook, Panasonic remains a leader in EV battery technology. If you want to dial up the risk-reward factor for your Japan stocks, PCRFY might fit the bill.\n\nLasertec (LSRCY) AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept.

However, you might not have heard about Lasertec, which is unfortunate, because it’s been a rocket ship of a performer. Specializing in the design and manufacture of semiconductor inspection and measurement equipment, LSRCY has been a beneficiary of the computer chip boom.\n\nUncharacteristic of many other Japan stocks, LSRCY has gained 119% in the year so far. Over the trailing 365-day period, shares have soared 143%. Economists often talk about a lost decade for Japan. Well, there’s nothing lost with Lasertec, except maybe a lost opportunity in buying shares when they were priced in the teens.\n\nStill, from what I’ve read, it’s quite possible that LSRCY still has more room to grow. According to the Bloomberg, “Lasertec Corp. is the world’s only maker of testing machines required to verify chip designs for the nascent extreme ultraviolet lithography (or EUV) method of chipmaking. In 2017, Lasertec solved a key piece of the EUV puzzle when it created a machine that can inspect blank EUV masks for internal flaws.”\n\n7 Travel Stocks to Pack in Your Portfolio Ahead of Holiday Trips\n\nConsidering the serious geopolitical implications behind EUV-related technologies, LSRCY is a name to watch closely, irrespective of the greenback’s gyrations.\n\nJapan Stocks to Buy: Seiko Epson (SEKEY) A photo of a printer made by Seiko Epson.\n\nSource: Cineberg / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith Seiko Epson, I’m going to leave this list of Japan stocks to buy on a fun note. But to be fair, I’m also leaving on an ambiguous note. Frankly, I’m not sure if the catalyst that drives the fundamental storyline of SEKEF will hold up or not.\n\nBut first, let’s back up for a moment. Seiko Epson, but better known these days as just Epson, specializes in computer printers, scanners and projectors (among other business categories) on the consumer electronics side. On the commercial end, the company provides point-of-sale systems, robots and industrial automation equipment.\n\nSome of these businesses seem destined to struggle with relevancy. For instance, printers risk severe commoditization within a generally declining market. Also, POS systems may struggle if more retail transactions move online.\n\nHowever, Seiko Epson is also known for its watches — and this year, mechanical watches are making a comeback. Among value-seeking horologists, Seiko ranks very highly. Indeed, the New York Times recently promoted the firm’s exceptional craftsmanship.\n\nBut will this consumer trend last? And can Seiko watches benefit? If the Covid-19 omicron variant puts a dent in the global economy, Seiko’s value proposition might rise to the forefront.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a LONG position in SONY.

"2021-11-25T01:19:34+00:00","For Aging Japan, a Cooker That Makes Chicken Soft as Butter","(Bloomberg) -- The $410 DeliSofter pot looks much like the rice cookers ubiquitous in Japanese households and it does prepare rice in 24 minutes. But this invention of two Panasonic Corp. engineers is designed to do more and help people with swallowing difficulties.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBillionaire Family Feud Puts a Century-Old Business Empire in Jeopardy Asia’s Richest Man Looks to Walton Family Playbook on Succession The 24-Year-Old Aiming to Dethrone Victoria’s Secret The Winners and Losers From a Year of Ranking Covid Resilience An Arab City’s Booming Art Scene Is Also a Grab at Soft Power\n\nThe two women led the creation of a spin-off company, Gifmo Co., to sell the specialized steam cooker, which they say can turn fried chicken soft enough to be sliced with a potato chip. The machine works by first cutting into food with a series of blades and then subjecting it to extremely high pressure at a temperature of 120 degrees Celsius, rendering many familiar foods digestible without sacrificing the original shape or texture, Gifmo said. It promises to restore a sense of normalcy to elderly people’s lives and diets, allowing them to mash food with their tongue alone.\n\nThe DeliSofter is the latest in a long line of nursing-care gadgets to arise in Japan, which has the world’s highest proportion of people over 65. From mechanized beds to robots that can converse with lonely retirees to Honda Motor Co. exoskeletons for walking assistance, the country’s tech firms have come up with a slew of innovations to aid the aged. Panasonic spun off Gifmo in 2019 to address that growing market, targeting a food segment estimated to surpass 200 billion yen ($1.7 billion) in Japan alone by 2025.\n\n“We always wanted to stop providing shredded food and have done what we can, but all options were costly and time-consuming,” said Takahiro Koyama, a care home manager in Panasonic’s home town of Osaka, who bought his first unit in the summer and later got a second. “The best part of the pot is it’s pretty much just a button-press away. Our chefs love it as they don’t need to dice food they cooked beautifully. Residents are also happy because it keeps food looking good, improving their appetite.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe DeliSofter struggles with fiber-rich foods and dishes like octopus or mushrooms, but its function addresses an acutely felt need. It was inspired by the experience of Megumi Ogawa, a 32-year Panasonic veteran, as she cared for her father in his final years. Diagnosed with a condition that made him susceptible to inhaling his food, he would complain bitterly about being deprived of his favorite meals. Choices for him were limited to blended liquid preparations.\n\n“I had to commit hours to preparing special dishes or spend $880 a month to buy nursing-care food just for my father,” Ogawa, who was previously a quality assurance officer, said.\n\nShe got the chance to try and solve the problem through her employer’s Game Changer Catapult initiative, an effort to incubate startups from within similar to programs run by other big firms like Sony Group Corp. Ogawa paired with colleague Tokie Mizuno, who joined Panasonic in 1983, and started work on what would become the DeliSofter. Neither had worked in product planning before, but Mizuno was driven to help after seeing how much her grandmother, who lived to 116, was buoyed by being able to eat with her family regularly.\n\nThe duo had their public debut at the U.S.-based SXSW conference in 2017, but Panasonic later reconsidered and tried to stop them. The company deemed a cooking appliance for people with swallowing difficulties too much of a litigation risk and also thought mass production difficult, asking Ogawa and Mizuno to return to their quality assurance duties.\n\n“So many who had encouraged us turned away and ordered us to stop working on the project,” Ogawa said. “I asked why, but they just told us that’s the life of an employee at a large company.”\n\nUnwilling to give up on the idea, Ogawa and Mizuno turned it into a voluntary project, joined by younger colleague Masaru Morizane, who now serves as Gifmo’s chief executive officer. Before Panasonic, he’d had stints at Corning Inc. and Sony, where he was in charge of mass production for the PlayStation 3 game console.\n\n“I love products that feel directly connected to consumers, and DeliSofter was the best example of it that I’ve ever encountered,” Morizane said.\n\nThe creators turned to BeeEdge, a startup funding platform led by Scrum Ventures with participation from INCJ and Panasonic, to set up Gifmo. After the pandemic delayed the product’s release, it went on sale in July last year and has sold more than 1,000 units since then, Gifmo said. The company expects to sell tens of thousands of pots in the years to come and ultimately aims to replace the conventional rice cooker, Morizane said. The DeliSofter is now being mass-produced at Panasonic’s appliance factory in China.\n\nThis is just the first of many hardware variants, Gifmo said, with other designs planned to address eating challenges that the current product is not suited for.\n\n“Just as appliances like washing machine freed women from housework and allowed them to be more active in society, we won’t stop until we liberate people from nursing care,” Mizuno said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMedical Debt Is Crushing Black Americans, and Hospitals Aren’t Helping Wildfires Are Getting Worse, and One Chemical Company Is Reaping the Benefits How Child Care Became the Most Broken Business in America Boeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed\n\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aging-japan-cooker-makes-chicken-011934781.html","GLW.F","GLW.US","HDMA.F","HMC.US","HNDAF.US","MAT1.F","MATA.F","PCRFF.US","PCRFY.US","SNEJF.US","SON1.F","SONA.F","SONY.US","","","","","","BLOOMBERG","MEGUMI OGAWA","PANASONIC","SWALLOWING DIFFICULTIES","TOKIE MIZUNO","","","","","","","","0.996","0.077","0.8","0.123"
"2021-11-23T17:29:12+00:00","7 Stocks to Buy Primed to Profit From a National EV Charging Network","Although many analysts have proclaimed for years that electric vehicles represent the future of transportation, this sentiment carried more narrative appeal than meaningful substance. The problem is, a cleaner, greener methodology for mobility cannot be possible without a robust EV charging network. After all, not everyone is a millionaire with access to their home-based charging solutions. If you’re looking for EV stocks to buy, you need to expand your search to include companies that can solve that problem.\n\nNot everyone has the luxury of a small number of miles in an urban setting. Yes, that’s wonderful if a 100-mile range vehicle is more than enough for you. However, everyone has different schedules and requirements. As well, some folks like to take long trips across city borders. Again, just because you don’t do that doesn’t mean other drivers follow suit, thereby necessitating EV charging networks, if only for inclusivity.\n\nOn a related note, if the electric alternative wishes to lose the alternative tag and become the everyday go-to solution, the infrastructure that is available now simply is not adequate. Consider that even for direct current (DC) fast chargers, you’re talking about an average of 30 minutes to fill to 80% capacity. That’s approximately a 500% increase in time over fueling a combustion car, necessitating robust EV charging networks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFortunately for fans of next-generation transportation solutions, an EV charging network rollout is a priority under the Biden administration’s proposed $2 trillion infrastructure plan, according to a CNBC report earlier this year. Under the plan, the president promises to have at least half a million EV charging devices installed across the U.S. by 2030. That would certainly go a long way in helping the credibility of the underlying sector.\n\n7 Cheap Stocks Under $10 That Are Actually Worth Your Time\n\nRecent dramatic news will have ripple effects for personal mobility as a whole. Therefore, it may be time to consider adding stocks to buy that will benefit from the EV charging rollout:\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Toyota (NYSE:TM) Panasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) Stem (NYSE:STEM) Volta (NYSE:VLTA)\n\nTo be fair, just because the public sentiment for EV charging is strong doesn’t mean that this market is a cakewalk. As The Verge pointed out, the fragmented nature of charging networks is one of the biggest hurdles facing mainstream integration. In addition, the cost to rollout this innovative shift will be massive. Therefore, readers should apply the same vigilance on these stocks as any other sector.\n\nEV Charging Stocks to Buy: Tesla (TSLA) TSLA stock: Tesla Super Charging station on Stockdale Hwy and the 5 fwy. Tesla Supercharger stations allow Tesla cars to be fast-charged at the network within an hour.\n\nSource: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com\n\nI want to be very careful with Tesla. As an equity unit that’s priced 376 times trailing earnings and 141 times forward earnings, I was and am skeptical about TSLA moving higher. At the same time, if we’re talking about the spirit of this article — which stocks can benefit from EV charging network additions — Tesla is a clear winner.\n\nAgain, I’m personally hesitant about TSLA because it seems too much positivity is baked into the share price. However, two factors readily come to mind: number one, I’ve been wrong before about TSLA and more importantly, the recent news that Hertz (OTCMKTS:HTZZ) will purchase 100,000 Tesla vehicles for $4.2 billion was a shocker.\n\nOf course, the deal suggests that Hertz is in a much better place following its catastrophic bankruptcy last year, one of the negative iconic moments of 2020. But the bigger implication for the potential rollout of a national EV charging network is that such a massive acquisition of electric cars suggest consumer demand is strong.\n\nTo use the commonly misquoted line, if you build it, they will come. Plus, the discount relative to its all-time high might appeal to brave investors.\n\nToyota (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a legacy automaker, Toyota does not seem to be a natural beneficiary if the U.S. launches a national EV charging network. Yes, it makes reliable cars at affordable prices, but the company has built its reputation on combustion power. It’s a new paradigm, so TM appears irrelevant.\n\nHowever, like so many other legacy names, Toyota is getting into the EV arena, recently unveiling its first all-electric car. Ultimately, the inclusion of renowned brands will symbiotically help not only the rollout of national EV charging networks but international ones as well. It’s not just Americans that are longing for cleaner, quieter roadways.\n\nJust as significantly, Toyota is a significant player in solid-state battery research and development, along with innovations in other battery formats. While many EV proponents claim that current technology fits in perfectly with their lifestyle, these folks need to remember one thing: Mainstreaming anything requires adaptability to a range of income stratums.\n\n7 Stocks to Watch Now as Consumer Prices Spike\n\nWith improved battery technologies, EV integration will be much more feasible for the modest income spectrum.\n\nEV Charging Stocks to Buy: Panasonic (PCRFY) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing/Shutterstock.com\n\nOnce one of the powerhouse brands in personal consumer electronics, Panasonic faded significantly against superior competition. But that doesn’t mean the company has been condemned to permanent irrelevance. On the contrary, Panasonic is now counted among the heavyweights for EV batteries, supplying the powerplants for Tesla.\n\nFurther, Panasonic made headlines when it unveiled a prototype battery, designed to help its longtime U.S. partner lower EV production costs. And if you want to know where Tesla needs to aim next, it’s in the income strata that can reasonably afford a $40,000 car in a post-pandemic environment where borrowing costs may be higher and where the government is not handing out stimulus checks.\n\nBut it’s not just about Tesla. Any automaker can make an expensive car that appeals to a specific demographic. The reason why Toyota was so successful for decades is because they made cars that almost anybody can afford without sacrificing basic quality and reliability.\n\nFor the equivalent to happen with the electric car, battery costs must come down. Should that happen with Panasonic’s new batteries, you can expect PCRFY to be a beneficiary of the EV charging rollout.\n\nChargePoint (CHPT) EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint (CHPT) charging station.\n\nSource: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarting from the time when shares of ChargePoint soared in late 2020, I’ve been generally cautious about its prospects. While the signs pointed to broader acceptance of electric cars — which in turn bolstered the narrative of EV charging plays like CHPT — it was difficult to ignore the challenges stymieing mainstream integration.\n\nAs I’ve previously stated, the current economics of EVs are problematic. The cheapest fully functional EV (that is, a vehicle with four wheels as opposed to a three-wheeled trike) is priced just under $30,000. And with the pandemic imposing all kinds of tension in the automotive retail market, that could be much higher in reality.\n\nFurther, the fragmented nature of present EV charging networks has imposed problems on drivers. In fact, 18% of California EV drivers between 2015 and 2019 switched back to combustion-powered cars primarily due to the hassles of charging. Obviously, that’s got to change for EV integration to be the new normal.\n\n6 Mega-Cap Stocks That Make Great Stocking Stuffers\n\nWell, if the national EV charging rollout occurs in earnest, ChargePoint may benefit substantially due to wider comfort and acceptance of electric cars.\n\nEV Charging Stocks to Buy: QuantumScape (QS) A sign for QuantumScape (QS).\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong the key reasons why the EV charging rollout has so far encountered obstacles is the broader practicality of what’s being asked. As you probably know, finding an empty pump at the gas station in a busy part of town can be troublesome enough. And that’s with the average refueling time of a mere five minutes.\n\nNow imagine that the vast majority of drivers own EVs. Physical laws and the materials that we’re currently using don’t allow for electric cars to charge adequately within a five-minute time frame. Therefore, unless we have plentiful charging stations, the electric transition will be problematic. But that’s also why QuantumScape as a speculative wager is so intriguing.\n\nAs you probably know, QuantumScape specializes in solid-state batteries. Featuring backing from major investors, QS has always carried massive upside potential. But the idea of converting this fantastical innovation from the laboratory setting into something commercial has long been a roadblock not just to QuantumScape but other organizations.\n\nStill, if you don’t mind speculating, QS could profit handsomely if the federal government gets serious about moving toward broader EV integration.\n\nStem (STEM) A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.\n\nSource: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.com\n\nBilled as the world leader in artificial-intelligence-enabled smart energy storage solutions, Stem is among the most intriguing names in the advanced energy market. Through its microgrid platform, for instance, enterprise-level clients can enjoy energy resilience in case of an unexpected power outage. Since such disruptions impose a severe (and unnecessary) economic cost, many have piled into STEM for its relevant services.\n\nBut with the company’s commercial EV business, there’s now one more important reason to be bullish. While most of the headlines involving electric mobility focuses on personal vehicles, many companies are now feverishly working to develop electric trucks. However, fleets of such transportation vehicles running across the country will require a significant overhaul in our EV charging network.\n\n7 Metaverse Stocks With the Potential to Make You Millions\n\nPotentially, Stem could bridge the gap between theory and actuality with its energy storage system for smart charging. While the business is obviously in its nascent stage, that could change over time if charging networks for personal vehicles are built out, facilitating greater demand for all things electric.\n\nEV Charging Stocks to Buy: Volta (VLTA) A photograph of a Volta (VLTA) charging station.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you want to add some speculation in your EV charging-related stocks to buy, you might want to consider Volta. Recently, the equity unit of the charging station provider — which offers a distinct take through its integrated advertising solution — shot up as the underlying company hit a milestone, delivering 100 million electric miles to drivers.\n\nAs with other sector developments, the news represents optimism on two fronts. First, it’s a great shot in the arm for Volta, which is competing against other rivals in the charging space. Second, the milestone achievement provides even more evidence that American consumers are embracing the gradual electrification of mobility.\n\nTo be fair, not everything about VLTA is encouraging. Because it entered the public market via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, questions naturally arise about the company’s viability. So far this year, SPACs have underperformed benchmark indices. And VLTA itself has been volatile, printing much red ink.\n\nStill, SPACs are improving overall and it seems VLTA is coming along for the ride. Further, with its own sector fundamentals moving in the right direction, Volta could offer something for the risk-tolerant speculator.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

"2021-11-22T16:40:04+00:00","PCRFY vs. DLB: Which Stock Is the Better Value Option?","Investors interested in stocks from the Audio Video Production sector have probably already heard of Panasonic Corp. (PCRFY) and Dolby Laboratories (DLB). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\n\nRight now, Panasonic Corp. is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Dolby Laboratories has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that PCRFY has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\n\nPCRFY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.77, while DLB has a forward P/E of 23.48. We also note that PCRFY has a PEG ratio of 0.50. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. DLB currently has a PEG ratio of 1.81.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for PCRFY is its P/B ratio of 1.15. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

"2021-11-19T08:24:44+00:00","Toyota Eyes North Carolina Site for First U.S. Battery Plant","(Bloomberg) -- Toyota Motor Corp. is planning to invest billions of dollars in a battery plant to be built on the outskirts of Greensboro, North Carolina, as part of the automaker’s efforts to ramp up output of electrified vehicles in the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nStartup Fever Is Gripping the World’s Last Big Untapped Nation A Denser City, But at What Cost? An Oil Company Went Up in Flames, Burning Lenders and the Planet Hong Kong's New Museum Tries to Please Art World — and Beijing Elizabeth Holmes Faces Last-Ditch Chance to Testify at Trial\n\nThe car manufacturer hasn’t made a final decision, but is expected to partner with Panasonic Corp. at the facility, said some of the people, who declined to be named as the discussions are private. No formal commitment has been made and the plan could still evolve, these people said.\n\nWhile details of the ownership and operation of the plant are still unclear, it will likely be via the two Japanese companies’ battery joint venture Prime Planet Energy & Solutions, one of the people said. Toyota spokesman Hideaki Homma said nothing new had been decided regarding the company’s U.S. battery investments. Prime Planet spokesman Masato Tokuhisa said the company is “always considering what’s best in regard to our production,” without commenting on specifics. Panasonic spokeswoman Yayoi Watanabe declined to comment.\n\nThe factory would be the anchor tenant in an industrial park called the Greensboro-Randolph Megasite, which the Randolph County Economic Development Corporation describes as an 1,825-acre parcel of former farmland rezoned for heavy industry and located near several interstate highways at the state’s center. Representatives for the site couldn’t be reached for comment.\n\nThe North Carolina plant would be the latest in a string of announcements by major automakers pivoting to electrified powertrains. Ford Motor Co. and South Korea’s SK Innovation Co. said in September they will spend $11.4 billion on an EV assembly plant and trio of battery factories in Tennessee and Kentucky. Jeep maker Stellantis NV is planning a U.S. battery plant with Samsung SDI Co.\n\nStory continues\n\nBattery JV\n\nPrime Planet is a Japan-based battery manufacturer that formally began operations last year. Toyota owns 51% of the venture, while Panasonic holds 49%. It currently claims the top share -- around 25% -- of the market for hybrid batteries and is looking to grow its presence in the EV battery sector as well.\n\nToyota has been slower than rivals to build an EV presence in the U.S. and embrace tighter vehicle emissions standards. In October, the company pledged to invest $3.4 billion in automotive batteries in the U.S. over the next decade, part of a larger plan to earmark 1.5 trillion yen ($13.1 billion) for battery development and production globally through 2030.\n\nThe Japanese company has been one of the loudest critics of proposed legislation in Congress backed by the Biden administration that favors EVs made in U.S. factories with unionized workforces for the most generous subsidies.\n\nToyota, which operates 10 non-union plants in the U.S., aims to start local production of batteries in 2025. The company said last month it will initially spend around $1.3 billion in conjunction with its trading arm, Toyota Tsusho Corp., to develop land and build facilities, creating 1,750 jobs.\n\nBudget Bill\n\nIn a budget bill signed into law Thursday by Governor Roy Cooper, the state is offering $135 million in aid to an unspecified manufacturer interested in the Greensboro industrial park and which will commit, among other things, to “invest at least one billion dollars in private funds and create at least 1,750 eligible positions.”\n\nAn additional $185 million in funding will be provided if the manufacturer boosts its investment to $3 billion and increases the job creation to at least 3,875 eligible positions at the site, according to the bill.\n\nA spokesman for North Carolina Senate leader Phil Berger said the state doesn’t comment on economic development projects until they’re finalized. Details in the bill about the site subsidies were reported earlier by the Triad Business Journal, a Greensboro-based trade publication.\n\nToyota announced in February that it will introduce two all-electric vehicles in the U.S. starting next year: a mainstream crossover called the bZ4X and an upscale Lexus model built on the same platform. Those will be its first wholly battery-powered vehicles in the U.S. since it stopped producing an all-electric version of its best-selling RAV4 crossover seven years ago.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Child Care Became the Most Broken Business in America Boeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed First Task for the Teamsters’ Next Boss: Take On UPS Google Wants to Save the Planet With Satellite Images Generation Lockdown: Where Youth Unemployment Has Surged\n\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/toyota-eyes-north-carolina-first-082444976.html","005930.KO","005935.KO","8TI.F","9TO.F","F.MX","F.US","FDMO34.SA","FMC1.F","FMC1.XETRA","MAT1.F","MATA.F","PCRFF.US","PCRFY.US","SMSNN.MX","SSNLF.US","SSU.F","SSU.STU","","BATTERY DEVELOPMENT","BLOOMBERG","ELECTRIFIED VEHICLES","GREENSBORO","MASATO TOKUHISA","NORTH CAROLINA","PRIME PLANET","TOYOTA","U.S","YAYOI WATANABE","","","0.991","0.027","0.892","0.081"
"2021-11-16T13:41:01+00:00","Dolby (DLB) Boosts In-Car Audio Experience of NIO ET7 Model","Dolby Laboratories, Inc. DLB recently announced that it has collaborated with a leading automobile manufacturer, NIO Inc. NIO, to incorporate its much-acclaimed Atmos technology in the latter’s smart flagship electric sedan — the ET7. Dolby Atmos will come standard on the latest sedan model and is expected to be delivered from the first quarter of 2022.\r\n\r\nHeadquartered in Shanghai, China, NIO specializes in the manufacture of smart EVs and autonomous vehicles. With research and development facilities based in Beijing, Munich, Shanghai, San Jose, London along with six other locations, the company is also involved in the first single-seater, all-electric racing series — FIA Formula E Championship.\r\n\r\nNIO is known for launching one of the world’s fastest electric cars, the EP9, in 2016. The China-based auto giant had unveiled its ET7 model in early 2021. Backed by avant-garde dimensions, the ET7 is equipped with a futuristic autonomous driving sensing system that offers an improved intelligent connectivity experience.\r\n\r\nWith double-dash daytime running lights, ET7’s revolutionary design creates substantial space for all occupants driven by multi-scenario interactions. Dolby Atmos is a state-of-the-art audio technology that empowers artists and creators to enjoy an immersive listening experience, thereby expanding their creative palette.\r\n\r\nWith more than five decades of industry expertise, the platform’s professional tools are heavily relied upon by content creators. Its intuitive tools are used for editing, mixing, and streamlining sound design workflows. It lets sounds travel in three-dimensional space with greater precision and taps new business opportunities with the creation of accretive movie titles, games, and TV series.\r\n\r\nThe incorporation of Dolby Atmos in NIO’s latest ET7 model comes as a boon especially at a time when the majority of auto companies are transitioning toward providing improved driving experiences with the rising adoption of future-proof automotive innovation technologies amid smart mobility scenarios. With a total output of 1000W, the NIO ET7’s audio system is equipped with 23 speakers. It has four primary channels that feature a mid-tone and bass driver, tweeter, four overhead speakers, and a subwoofer.\r\n\r\nThanks to Dolby Atmos’ best-in-class clarity and active tuning algorithm, the electric vehicle will provide passengers with an enhanced in-car audio experience. Driven by Dolby’s technological prowess, NIO will be able to create a unique value for the ET7 model by emphasizing on the future of car audio to consumers based in China and internationally. Music is a crucial part of the in-car experience and Dolby Atmos’ presence will make the overall experience worthwhile with an extraordinary listening experience. Currently, the vehicle is available for pre-order through the NIO app.\r\n\r\nDolby is well poised to benefit from higher adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos technology with the rising demand for premium-viewing experiences. Its growth strategy stands on three pillars — advancing the science of sight and sound, providing creative solutions, and delivering superior experiences. Diligent capital deployment strategies and robust financials ensure the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s long-term growth. Gradual growth in Dolby Cinema’s footprint, as a result of the post-pandemic market revival, is expected to drive the San Francisco, CA-based company’s business.\r\n\r\nDolby’s shares have lost 10.7% against the industry’s growth of 20.4% in the past three months.
