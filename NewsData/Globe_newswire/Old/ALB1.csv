"2022-07-07T15:23:03+00:00","Endeavour Silver (EXK) Buys Pitarrilla, Boosts Portfolio","Endeavour Silver Corporation EXK announced that it has completed the acquisition of SSR Mining Inc.’s SSRM Pitarrilla Project. Located in Durango, Mexico, it is one of the largest undeveloped silver deposits in the world and adds to EXK’s growth pipeline in a mining-friendly jurisdiction, where the company already has extensive experience and expertise. This move marks a step forward in Endeavour Silver’s goal of becoming a premier senior silver producer.\r\n\r\nEndeavour Silver purchased Pitarrilla by acquiring all the issued and outstanding shares of SSR Durango, from SSR Mining and Silver Standard Ventures Inc. for a total consideration of approximately $70 million. This comprises around $35 million in EXK’s common shares and $35 million in cash and a 1.25% net smelter returns royalty on Pitarrilla. SSR Mining now owns 4.52% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Endeavour Silver. Per the deal, EXK will have matching rights to purchase the net smelter returns royalty in case SSRM intends to sell it.\r\n\r\nThe Pitarrilla property consists of 4,950 hectares across five concessions and has significant infrastructure in place, with direct access to utilities. The buyout elevates Endeavour Silver’s portfolio as a leading mid-tier silver producer, with high-quality silver exposure and significant growth. The company has set forth to verify all historical data to prepare a current mineral resource estimate, drill high-priority exploration targets and define regional targets. Management has earmarked $1.8 million for the same.\r\n\r\nEXK’s current growth pipeline includes the Terronera and Parral projects. Once a current resource is defined, Pitarrilla is expected to be substantially accretive on a silver-equivalent resource per share metric. While Terronera is the next project to be developed, the company stated that it might prioritize the Pitarrilla development over Parral, depending on the further drilling and analysis of economies of various scales and options for production.\r\n\r\nPitarrilla is a strategic fit for Endeavour Silver, which has a successful development, exploration and underground mining track record in the region. The project has been de-risked by SSR Mining, with several key exploration and mining permits obtained and collaboration agreements already in place with the local community. The geology at Pitarrilla is similar to Endeavour Silver’s underground mines — Guanacevi and Bolanitos — which is an advantage.\r\n\r\nPer the Silver Institute, the global silver market realized growth in every demand category in 2021. The total global silver demand has peaked to the highest level since 2015, gaining 19% to 1.05 billion ounces last year. Gains are expected this year as well across all key demand components. Consequently, the global silver demand is expected to attain a record-high of 1.112 billion ounces. The increase will mainly be driven by record silver industrial fabrication, which is expected to be up 5% due to higher demand from both traditional and critical green technologies. Silver being a critical element to decarbonize the economy, its demand is expected to remain strong in the years to come. With the addition of Pitarrilla, Endeavour Silver will be able to capitalize on this demand in the years ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares of EXK have fallen 48.6% over the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 45.4%.\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nEndeavour Silver currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Albemarle Corporation ALB and Cabot Corporation CBT, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

ALB has rallied roughly 17% in a year.\r\n\r\nCabot has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.5% for the current fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CBT's earnings for the current fiscal has been revised 6% upward in the past 60 days.\r\n\r\nCabot's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 16.2%.

"2022-07-07T10:02:20+00:00","7 Best Green Energy Stocks to Buy in July","There are many compelling reasons to invest in the best green energy stocks in July, or in any other month. According to Investopedia, one of the big reasons is a global push toward “Net Zero carbon emissions” by the year 2050. Much of the world is transitioning away from fossil fuels and toward energy sources that emit less carbon. And in order for the world to reach that net-zero goal, we’re going to have to make changes in how we power things.\n\nFor one, current data suggest that investment in renewables will need to triple in order for the net-zero emissions goal to be met. That strongly implies that the recent push for greener energy sources is more than just a fad.\n\nSecular trends in energy use and the push for greener sources will continue in the coming years and decades. That means that the stocks and companies listed above should continue to perform well over the longer term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n7 Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in July 2022\n\nAnd in the shorter term, these best green energy stocks are also likely to receive increasing attraction as the war in Ukraine continues to affect gas and oil prices.\n\nBE Bloom Energy $17.29 ALB Albemarle $198.30 ENPH Enphase $194.93 TAN Invesco Solar ETF $71.06 RUN Sunrun $24.55 XPEV XPeng $30.74 BEP Brookfield Renewable Partners $34.65\n\nBloom Energy (BE) BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) engages in a unique niche within the green energy marketplace. The company manufactures a product called the Bloom Energy server. Bloom Energy servers convert natural gas or biogas into electricity by utilizing an electrochemical process that does not involve combustion.\n\nThat unique process aside, one of the primary reasons to consider investing in Bloom Energy is the current potential returns.\n\nBased on its target stock price of over $24 and current price of under $18, there’s around 38% upside.\n\nAnother of the primary reasons to consider investing in Bloom Energy this month is that it continues to make progress in the European market. The European market itself is noted for being more accepting of green energy overall, and Bloom Energy has proven that to be the case with its  June partnership withFerrari (NYSE:RACE) in Italy. Ferrari is committed to utilizing Bloom Energy servers in order to reach carbon net neutrality by 2030\n\nStory continues\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe general description of Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) as a company and stock is one focused on the development, manufacturing and marketing of chemicals for a variety of consumer markets. But that isn’t the reason that most people are interested in Albemarle currently.\n\nInstead, the interest primarily has to do with the electric vehicle market and Albemarle’s position as a leading producer of lithium.\n\nIt’s difficult to say that ALB stock will necessarily jump in July. However, it’s reasonable to expect that might be the case.\n\nAlbemarle increased its full-year guidance back in May after renegotiating variable price contracts with its customers. That revised guidance means that both net sales and EBITDA figures for 2022 have significantly improved. For example, net sales guidance previously ranged from $5.2 to $5.6 billion. After the revision, that range moved up to between $5.8 to $6.2 billion.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that there’s no immediate signal that the markets will prefer lithium producers in July as opposed to any other month.\n\nHigh-Quality Stocks to Buy That Are Trading Below Fair Value\n\nHowever, if conditions change and lithium has some sort of catalyst then Albemarle will be among the first stocks to rise.\n\nEnphase (ENPH) mobile phone screen with enphase energy logo on it to represent renewable energy stocks\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSimply following the price chart for Enphase (NASDAQ:ENPH) throughout 2022 indicates that ENPH stock is difficult to pin down. Overall, it’s up a very respectable 6% year-to-date. But that ride hasn’t been without serious volatility. Though it now approaches $200, it dipped below $120 in late January, only to move quickly upward, peaking above $215 by early April. It has seesawed back and forth since.\n\nThat might scare many investors away. However, given overwhelming analyst support and a target price of $225.86, meaning upside of over 16%, there’s reason to be positive.\n\nOn top of that, Enphase has produced earnings beats in each of the last four quarters.\n\nWhether it jumps significantly higher in July remains to be seen. But it’s fair to assume that Enphase will trend upward over time. The company is undergoing rapid growth. It should see revenues increase more than 50% in 2022 and before tapering to 30% growth in 2023.\n\nBoth cases imply secular trends that favor Enphase as an investment.\n\nInvesco Solar ETF (TAN)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPicking the winners and losers from any given sector is often difficult. In an industry like green energy, this could be especially difficult, as it’s a relatively young industry and companies that exist now may not exist tomorrow. That’s why Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN) makes sense.\n\nThe Invesco Solar ETF is designed to track the performance of The Mac Global Solar Energy Index. Enphase, which I mentioned above, represents the largest holding in this ETF.\n\nYear-to-date, TAN stock has fallen from the $78 level to around $71 at present. The positive here is that it has a relatively low expense ratio of 0.66%, or 66 cents per $10,000 invested annually.\n\nThe other positive is that the Invesco Solar ETF has performed very well over the prevailing three-year, five-year, and 10-year periods.\n\n7 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next Decade\n\nOver each of those time frames, it has outperformed its benchmark, sometimes significantly.\n\nSunRun (RUN) The Sunrun (RUN) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in front of an American flag.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe reason to buy SunRun (NASDAQ:RUN) stock in July is that Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) had given it the thumbs up in late June.\n\nAnalyst Brian Lee maintains a “buy” rating for SunRun based on what he sees as better execution which is positively affecting growth and margins.\n\nLee simultaneously downgraded his ratings for two of SunRun’s competitors, Sunnova Energy (NYSE:NOVA) and SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR).\n\nThe bullish thesis for SunRun in July, then, is that investor capital could flee from the previous two mentioned shares and into SunRun based on Lee’s advocacy.\n\nRUN stock currently trades below $25 but the Goldman Sachs analyst believes it is worth $36, implying substantial upside over the next year.\n\nThe average target price for RUN stock is an even higher $46.98.\n\nXPeng (XPEV) The Logo of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng (Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors, also known as XMotors.ai) on tablet. XPEV stock.\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock\n\nXPeng (NYSE:XPEV) stock will continue to be volatile. It represents EV stocks, growth and China. Any of those categories are highly sensitive to market news. So when you combine all three, XPEV could logically move up, or down, very quickly.\n\nThe reason to believe it might move upward in July is rooted in reports related to deliveries from May. A Barron’s report from late May suggested that  XPeng is expected to deliver between 31,000 and 34,000 vehicles in the second quarter.\n\nThe company delivered 10,125 in May when all was said and done. There’s reason to believe that sales could be heating up quickly, though, as electrification trends in China are rising quickly. That could mean that EV sales jumped substantially as lockdowns ended.\n\n7 REITs to Buy in July 2022\n\nIf that’s the case, XPeng could be at the higher end of that sales range predicted in May.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) The Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in front of a digital American flag background.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe bullish thesis around Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) stock can be found at the beginning of this article. That is, the notion that investment in green energy will need to triple in order for those 2050 global net-zero carbon goals to be met.\n\nBrookfield is essentially headed toward that goal currently. Its portfolio of projects includes hydroelectric, solar, wind and storage facilities across multiple geographies and totals more than 21,000 megawatts of capacity. Its pipeline of current projects is expected to total roughly 69,000 megawatts of energy when installed.\n\nBEP stock is another analyst favorite with reasonable upside based on price expectations. Its broad-reaching impact and diverse holdings make it a safe bet in green energy for the long-term investor.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

"2022-07-06T17:08:05+00:00","Wheaton (WPM), Hecla Ink Deal to End Keno Hill's Silver Stream","Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. WPM entered into an agreement with Hecla Mining Company HL to terminate its existing silver stream on Alexco Resource Corp.'s AXU Keno Hill Silver property for $135 million. The termination is conditional upon the completion of Hecla's acquisition of Alexco.\r\n\r\nWheaton will have a 5.6% shareholding interest in Hecla’s shares after the Keno Hill silver stream deal ends. The move supports WPM’s focus on boosting shareholders’ value by strategically identifying opportunities inside and outside of its portfolio. \r\n\r\nYesterday, America’s largest silver producer Hecla signed an all-stock deal to buy all of the outstanding shares of Canadian Alexco that Hecla does not already own. Per the deal, Hecla will issue 0.116 shares to Alexco shareholders for consideration of 47 cents per share of Alexco. The figure represents a 23% premium on Alexco’s five-day volume-weighted average price on the New York Stock Exchange on July 1.\r\n\r\nWheaton is focused on adding additional production capacity from high-quality accretive metals. Its business model focuses on reducing risk while leveraging higher commodity prices. The company remains active on the corporate development front and is focused on growing a high-quality portfolio of assets.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter, the company added two new streams and increased interest in a third stream from the existing mine. On Jan 17, 2022, Wheaton entered into a Precious Metals Purchase Agreement (PMPA) with Alliance Metals International, a subsidiary of Adventus Mining Corporation, to acquire gold and silver streams from the Adventus Curipamba Project.\r\n\r\nOn Feb 8, the company entered another PMPA with Sabina Gold & Silver Corp to buy gold stream from its Goose Project. On Mar 21, the company amended its PMPA with Aris Gold Corporation to buy gold and silver streams from Marmato mines. Including these projects, Wheaton has added eight new streams in the past year, which have brought immediate production and medium and longer-term growth to its robust portfolio of assets. Wheaton is committed to deploying more than $1 billion over the next three to five years on streams that will further boost its outlook.\r\n\r\nWheaton anticipates achieving current-year production of between 700,000 GEOs and 760,000 GEOs. It produced 752,958 GEOs in 2021. Gold production is expected in the band of 350,000-380,000 ounces. It produced 342,546 ounces of gold in 2021. Production of other metals is expected in the range of 44,000 to 48,000 GEOs for 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance\n\nShares of Wheaton have lost 9.2% in six months compared with the industry’s fall of 16.6%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nZacks Rank & Stock to Consider\n\nWheaton currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nA better-ranked stock in the basic materials space includes Albemarle Corporation ALB, which flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"2022-07-06T14:57:02+00:00","Hecla (HL) Adds High-Grade Silver Property With Alexco Buyout","Hecla Mining Company HL recently announced that it would acquire all of the remaining outstanding common shares in Alexco Resource Corp. AXU. HL is currently the largest primary silver producer in the United States and the third-largest in the world. Following this buyout, there's a possibility of it becoming Canada's largest silver producer as well.\r\n\r\nAlexco is a Canadian primary silver company that owns and operates the majority of the historic Keno Hill Silver District in Canada's Yukon Territory — one of the highest-grade silver districts in the world.\r\n\r\nWith this buyout, Hecla gains access to a fully permitted property in a premier mining jurisdiction with infrastructure that includes a 400-ton per day mill, on-site camp facility, all-season highway access, and connection to the hydropower grid. It adds to Hecla's significant silver reserves. The company recently reported that its silver reserves increased to 200 million ounces in 2021 — the second highest silver reserves in its 130-year history. The Alexco buyout will increase proven and probable silver reserves by 19% to 237 million ounces, measured and indicated resources by 24% to 257 million ounces and inferred resources by 7% to 523.7 million ounces.\r\n\r\nAlexco had fallen behind its Keno Hill development and production plan and its original estimate of achieving commercial production in early 2022. Being a much larger business and given its organizational expertise and financial strength, Hecla is likely to achieve the full potential of Keno Hill while investing in exploration across the district.\r\n\r\nEach outstanding common share of Alexco will be exchanged for 0.116 of a share of Hecla common stock. This implies a consideration of 47 cents per Alexco common share and a premium of 23% based on the companies' five-day volume-weighted average price on the New York Stock Exchange on Jul 1, 2022. Per the deal, Hecla will provide interim financing to provide working capital and ensure the development and exploration at Keno Hill and subscribe for additional common shares, taking its stake to 9.9%.\r\n\r\nHecla has entered into a deal with Wheaton Precious Metals Corporation WPM. According to the deal, Wheaton Precious Metals will terminate its silver streaming interest in Alexco's Keno Hill property. For this, WPM will receive $135 million of Hecla's common stock. However, this is subject to the completion of Hecla's acquisition of Alexco, which is expected in September 2022.\r\n\r\nPer the Silver Institute, the global silver market realized growth in every demand category in 2021. Total global silver demand peaked at its highest level since 2015, gaining 19% to 1.05 billion ounces last year. Gains are expected this year as well across all key demand components, which will take global silver demand to a record high of 1.112 billion ounces. The increase will primarily be driven by record silver industrial fabrication, which is anticipated to be up 5% on account of higher demand in both traditional and critical green technologies.

Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet’s find out why this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining at the moment.\n\nWhat’s Going in FMC’s Favor?\n\nFMC Corp is benefiting from higher demand for its products, its portfolio strength and contributions of new products. The company is seeing healthy demand for its industry leading products, driven by strong global agricultural market fundamentals. The strong demand environment coupled with the company’s price increase actions is driving its top line. The company is actively taking price increase measures to mitigate the impact of cost inflation.\r\n\r\nThe company is well placed to capitalize on the underlying strength in global crop protection markets thanks to high commodity prices. It is seeing demand strength for diamides and insecticides in North America on higher crop commodity prices. Demand for Rynaxypyr brands continues to grow in the region. Strong demand is also being witnessed in corn, sugarcane and soybean applications in Brazil, aided by higher planted areas and high commodity prices. Demand for herbicides also remains strong in Australia. FMC Corp is also seeing strength in its insecticide portfolio in Asia.\r\n \r\nFMC Corp also remains focused on boosting its market position and strengthening its product portfolio. It is investing in technologies and products as well as new launches to enhance value to the farmers. New products launched in Europe, North America and Asia are gaining significant traction and are contributing to volume growth. Product introductions are expected to support the company’s results this year.\r\n\r\nThe company also remains committed to return value to shareholders leveraging healthy cash flows. It expects to generate free cash flow of $515-$735 million in 2022. FMC Corp also expects to buy back stock worth $500-$600 million and pay dividends worth around $270 million in 2022.\n\nA Few Concerns\n\nFMC Corp faces headwinds from higher logistics and raw materials costs due to the intensified supply disruptions. The supply disruptions, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have resulted in rising costs of some raw materials and active ingredients. Along with higher packaging costs, raw material and logistics costs are likely to remain elevated through 2022. Pandemic-related shutdowns in China and elevated energy costs in Europe are the other concerns. Higher raw materials and logistics costs might impact the company’s performance.\r\n\r\nThe company is also exposed to challenges from unfavorable currency swings. It is particularly challenged by currency headwinds associated with the weakening of European currencies. Currency headwinds are expected to drag the company’s performance in 2022.\n\nFMC Corporation Price and Consensus FMC Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nFMC Corporation price-consensus-chart | FMC Corporation Quote\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nBetter-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include Albemarle Corporation ALB, Cabot Corporation CBT and Nutrien Ltd.

SAND announced preliminary record gold equivalent ounces (GEOs) sold and revenues in the second quarter of 2022.\r\n\r\nThe company sold nearly 19,200 attributable GEOs in the quarter. This marks a 7% increase from 18,004 ounces GEOs sold in second-quarter 2021. The company generated preliminary revenues of $36 million in the quarter under discussion compared with the year-ago quarter's $26.4 million.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary cost of sales, excluding the depletion for the June-end quarter, was $5.3 million, which came in higher than $4.1 million reported in the second quarter of 2021. This led to cash operating margins of approximately $1,590 per attributable GEO in the quarter under review, higher than the prior-year quarter's $1,569 per GEO.\r\n\r\nThe second-quarter 2022 results built on the momentum of the strong performance in the first quarter.

In 2021, Sandstorm Gold had sold approximately a record 67,548 attributable GEOs, up 29% from the prior year's levels. The figure came within the company's guidance of 64,000-69,000 ounces. The company delivered record revenues of $114.9 million for the year.\r\n\r\nPer the company's guidance provided on May 11, attributable GEOs are expected between 80,000 and 85,000 for 2022. This is subject to the closing of the Nomad Acquisition (expected in the second half of this year) and BaseCore Transaction, which is anticipated to be completed in the third quarter. The company had mentioned that it is expecting attributable gold equivalent production to be more than 155,000 ounces in 2025, subject to the conversion of the HodMaden interest into a gold stream.\r\n\r\nSandstorm Gold is a gold royalty company that provides upfront financing to gold miners who are looking for capital. In return, the company receives the right to a percentage of the gold produced from a mine for the life of the mine. It currently boasts a portfolio of 25 royalties, of which 39 of the underlying mines are producing now.

"2022-07-05T13:36:49+00:00","Here's What To Make Of Albemarle's (NYSE:ALB) Decelerating Rates Of Return","If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. However, after investigating Albemarle (NYSE:ALB), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Albemarle is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.073 = US$681m ÷ (US$11b - US$2.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nSo, Albemarle has an ROCE of 7.3%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Chemicals industry average of 12%.\n\nView our latest analysis for Albemarle  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Albemarle's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our freereport for Albemarle.\n\nSo How Is Albemarle's ROCE Trending?\n\nThe returns on capital haven't changed much for Albemarle in recent years. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 7.3% and the business has deployed 51% more capital into its operations. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Albemarle's ROCE\n\nAs we've seen above, Albemarle's returns on capital haven't increased but it is reinvesting in the business. Since the stock has gained an impressive 97% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne more thing to note, we've identified  3 warning signs  with Albemarle and understanding these should be part of your investment process.\n\nWhile Albemarle isn't earning the highest return, check out this freelist of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

It expects sales volumes to exceed 140,000 metric tons this year.\r\n\r\nIodine volumes are also being supported by growing demand following the post-pandemic recovery. The company also expects iodine prices to continue to rise in the coming quarters. Global potassium prices are also have been driven by the shortage of potassium-based fertilizers. This is driving prices in the company’s potassium business lines.\r\n\r\nEarnings estimates for Sociedad Quimica have also been going up over the past two months, reflecting analysts’ optimism. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sociedad Quimica for 2022 has increased around 55%. The consensus estimate for second-quarter 2022 has also been revised roughly 95% upward over the same time frame.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2022 for Sociedad Quimica is currently pegged at $9.49, reflecting an expected year-over-year growth of 362.9%.

Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSherwin-Williams is gaining from favorable demand in domestic markets. It is witnessing strong sales across professional contractor end markets, which is driving sales in the Americas Group segment. The company is benefiting from continued strength in residential repaint, commercial, property maintenance and new residential segments. It expects strong demand to continue in North American architectural end markets. Demand also remains solid in industrial end markets.\r\n\r\nSherwin-Williams’ cost-control initiatives, working capital reductions, supply chain optimization and productivity improvement are also expected to have provided margin benefits. It is also implementing pricing actions to offset cost inflation.\r\n\r\nThe company also remains committed toward expanding its retail operations. It is focused on capturing a larger share of its end-markets, as is evident from increasing number of retail stores. It expects to add 80-100 new stores in 2022.\r\n\r\nSherwin-Williams also has a strong liquidity position and is using its cash strategically. The company repurchased 1.45 million shares of its common stock in the first quarter. It had remaining authorization to repurchase 47.1 million shares through open market purchases at the end of the quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company faces headwinds from higher raw material costs. Raw material inflation had an impact on the company’s performance in the first quarter. Raw material availability negatively impacted all three segments, especially the Americas Group. The impacts of raw material cost inflation are likely to continue in the second quarter. The company sees input cost inflation of low-double-digit to mid-teens percentage this year. Sherwin-Williams is also seeing higher labor and transportation costs.

Tight inventory along with healthy demand is also driving phosphate prices globally. Fertilizer prices are also shooting higher amid supply concerns triggered by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Lower global supply availability stemming from reduced operating rates, strong demand and a spike in energy prices are likely to have also boosted nitrogen prices.  Supply constraints are driving ammonia and nitrate prices. Higher prices are expected to drive the company’s sales and margins for full-year 2022.\r\n\r\nNutrien is also taking actions to boost potash production in the wake of tightening global potash market conditions. The move is in response to strong market fundamentals and is geared to enable its customers have the crop inputs they require to feed a growing population.

"2022-06-30T14:19:02+00:00","Great Panther Mining (GPL) to Divest Silver Mines in Mexico","Great Panther Mining Limited GPL recently announced that it has entered into an agreement with Guanajuato Silver Company Ltd. to sell 100% of its subsidiary Minera Mexicana El Rosario S.A. de C.V. (""MMR""), which comprises the Guanajuato Mine Complex, the Topia mine, and the El Horcón and Santa Rosa projects in Mexico. This is a strategic transaction for GPL as it marks an important step toward becoming a gold company focused on maximizing the potential of the Tucano Gold Mine. By divesting its assets in Mexico, the company intends to pursue growth opportunities in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe sale of the silver mines in Mexico will enable Great Panther to focus on maximizing the full potential of the Tucano Gold Mine in Brazil. According to the company, the mine has the greatest value creation potential for its stakeholders. GPL intends to continue investing in unlocking value from both the underground as well as the regional potential of the district. The company’s long-term objective is to expand further in Brazil, and divesting the Mexican silver assets will help it achieve these goals.\r\n\r\nPer the agreement, Guanajuato Silver will purchase MMR for a total upfront consideration of $14.7 million and up to $2 million in additional payments.\r\n\r\nLast month, Great Panther reported an adjusted loss per share of 2 cents in first-quarter 2022 against earnings of 1 cent per share in the year-ago quarter. Lower metal sales volumes due to decreased production, offset partially by higher realized prices for gold, lead and zinc, led to the loss.\r\n\r\nGreat Panther produced 17,913 gold-equivalent ounces in the first quarter of 2022, 41% lower than the year-ago quarter due to lesser output at the Tucano mine in Brazil and the Topia mine in Mexico. The figure included 14,319 ounces of gold and 173,698 silver ounces.\r\n\r\nThe company stated that it remains on track to return to a normalized production rate in the second half of the year and affirmed its consolidated production guidance at 100,000-119,000 gold-equivalent ounces for 2022. In the second half of 2022, Tucano is expected to contribute at least 65% to the guidance. Significant stripping activity and low production of gold ounces in the quarter resulted in higher unit costs compared with the prior-year quarter. However, these costs are anticipated to normalize in the second half of 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nShare Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company’s shares have plunged 79.5% in a year compared with the industry’s decline of 39.9%.\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nGreat Panther currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Allegheny Technologies Inc.

"2022-06-30T13:54:01+00:00","Vale (VALE) Rides on Solid Demand &amp; Cost Control Efforts","Vale S.A VALE is well-poised to benefit from its efforts to improve productivity, introduce high-quality ore in the market, and control costs. Backed by its solid cash flow, Vale has been lowering debt levels while investing in growth projects. The company's efforts to streamline its portfolio and focus on boosting production from its most profitable businesses are commendable.\n\nIron Ore Demand & Prices to Boost Revenues\n\nDespite a 6% year-over-year decline in iron ore production in the first quarter of 2022 due to high rainfall, Vale maintained iron ore production guidance at 320-335 Mt for 2022. Nickel production declined 5.4% in the quarter on account of unscheduled maintenance in the Onça Puma electric furnace, ramping up at Sudbury mines after the labor disruption and repairs at the Totten mine shaft. With Sudbury reaching pre-strike rates and Totten resuming operations, the company affirmed its nickel production guidance at 175 kt to 190 kt for 2022.\n\nSteel demand from the automotive sector, infrastructure, and housing markets will continue to support demand for iron ore. Vale remains committed to the goal of introducing more high-quality ore into the market. The company ended 2021 with 340 Mt of production capacity and expected it to go up to 370 Mtpy by 2022-end, after the ramp-up of the tailings filtration plants at the Itabira and Brucutu sites and their respective additions in tailings storage capacity during the second half of the year. It is anticipated to increase to 450 Mtpy in the future.\n\nVale remains committed to the goal of introducing more high-quality ore into the market. It strives to deliver the highest possible margins by managing an extensive supply chain and flexible product portfolio. It has been focusing on the product line to capture industry trends, improve quality and productivity, control costs, strengthen the logistics infrastructure of railroads, ports, shipping and distribution centers, and cement relationships with customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nIron ore prices have rebounded to $125 per ton lately, courtesy of solid demand prospects amid easing coronavirus-induced restrictions in Shanghai and other Chinese cities. Several steelmakers are set to restart production amid declining margins and insufficient demand to replenish inventories. Copper prices are expected to gain on a pickup in demand as China eases restrictions. This bodes well for Vale.\n\nSolid Balance Sheet, Investment to Aid Growth\n\nOver 2016-2021, the company's cash flow has witnessed a CAGR of 21%. Backed by solid cash flow, Vale continues to lower its debt position and strengthen its balance sheet. It had a total debt-to-capital ratio of 0.32 at the end of the first quarter of 2022. The company paid $3.5 billion to shareholders as dividends in the first quarter of 2022 and has completed 84% of its current share buyback program so far. Its board of directors has approved a new program of up to 500 million shares (equivalent to around 10% of currently outstanding shares) that will be executed in the following 18 months after the current buyback program is concluded.\n\nVale expects capital spending of $5.8 billion in 2022. The company is investing in the Serra Sul project, which is expected to increase the S11D mine plant capacity by 20 Mtpy (million tons per year) to 120 Mtpy. Investment in solar energy projects like the Sol do Cerrado project will help cut down the company's average energy cost while increasing its share in renewable energy. Vale has plans to spend an average of $5.5 billion in subsequent years. The company has announced investments of $4-6 billion for greenhouse gas emission reduction by 2030.\n\nIt recently announced that it has completed the prefeasibility study for its proposed nickel sulfate project in Quebec, Canada. The project is expected to process 25,000 tons of contained nickel annually into nickel sulfate. This project development is in sync with the company's ongoing endeavors to deliver low-carbon and high-purity nickel products for the promising electric vehicle industry. The project would be the first-of-its-kind fully domestic nickel sulfate facility for the North American market, leveraging current and future production of low-carbon and high-grade nickel from Vale's world-class Canadian operations.\n\nThe company is working toward transforming its base metals business and believes it will attain 500 ktpy (kilo tons per year) with projects already in the pipeline — Salobo III, Alemao and Cristalino. It has taken steps to simplify its portfolio and focus on bolstering production from its most profitable businesses.\n\nPrice Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn the past year, shares of Vale have fallen 31.3%, compared with the industry's decline of 31.2%.\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nVale currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"2022-06-29T16:20:04+00:00","Teck (TECK) Initiates CCUS Project to Reduce Carbon Emission","Teck Resources Limited TECK announced a Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) pilot project at its Trail Operations metallurgical facility in southern British Columbia. This pilot project is likely to start operation in the second half of 2023.\r\n\r\nCCUS pilot project supports Teck’s Net-Zero Climate Change Strategy in addition to the company’s goal to reduce the carbon emission of its operations by 33% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Also, this project will help the company for the application of carbon capture, utilization and storage as an emissions reduction solution.\r\n\r\nCCUS will capture CO2 from the Acid Plant flue gas at Trail Operations at a rate of three tons per day. The company will assess options for the utilization of the captured CO2. TECK is committed to lower greenhouse gas releases across its operations. Moreover, this pilot project will enable its steelmaking coal customers in substantially reducing the carbon exposure of their steel production.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the project can scale up its industrial CCUS plant with the potential to capture more than 100 thousand tons of CO2 annually at Trail Operations, equivalent to the carbon emissions of more than 20,000 cars.\r\n\r\nTeck has a portfolio of world-class assets in stable jurisdictions and a solid pipeline of projects. Higher prices of the company’s principal products and better-than-expected performance of its mine operations contributed to first-quarter 2022 results.  During the quarter, the Steelmaking coal segment benefited from the record increase in FOB Australia steelmaking coal prices, CFR China prices and strong demand from steelmakers. The segment will continue to perform well in the current year with higher mine site steelmaking coal inventories. The company expects steelmaking coal sales of 6.3-6.7 million tons in second-quarter 2022, as it captures deferred sales from the previous two quarters.\r\n\r\nTeck expects the 2022 production of zinc in concentrate (including co-product zinc production from Antamina) to be 630,000-665,000 tons, higher than the 2021 production of 607,400 tons. Contained metal production from the Red Dog mine is expected in the band of 540-570 thousand tons for 2022, up from 2021 production of 503.4 thousand tons.  Sales of Red Dog zinc in concentrate are expected in between 50,000 and 70,000 tons in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting the regular seasonal pattern of Red Dog sales. The refined zinc market continues to strengthen on improving demand for manufacturing, automotive, construction and infrastructure sectors.\r\n\r\nThe company expects 2022 refined zinc production from trail operations to be between 270,000 tons and 285,000 tons. In 2021, it produced 279,000 tons. The trail has major maintenance activities planned from September to November, which are expected to impact production in the current year.\r\n\r\nTeck continues to face inflationary cost pressures, particularly in diesel prices and transportation costs. Increased steel, crude oil and natural gas prices are driving prices for certain key supplies like mining equipment, fuel, tires and explosives. These factors will continue to put pressure on the company’s margin in the second quarter. Copper and steelmaking coal segments are likely to be unfavorably impacted by these factors.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance\n\nTeck’s shares have gained 16.9% in the past six months, against the industry’s loss of 4.5%.

"2022-06-28T16:41:17+00:00","Albemarle Urges US to Cut Red Tape to Boost Lithium Supply Chain","(Bloomberg) -- The world’s largest lithium producer is urging the US government to cut red tape to accelerate a build-out of a domestic supply chain for materials needed for batteries, electric vehicles and cleaner technologies while cutting dependence on China.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nRussia Slips Into Historic Default as Sanctions Muddy Next Steps Michael Burry of ‘The Big Short’ Fame Warns Fed May Alter Course Big Tech Sinks Stocks Bruised by Recession Fears: Markets Wrap A $2 Trillion Free-Fall Rattles Crypto to the Core Anti-Abortion Centers Find Pregnant Teens Online, Then Save Their Data\n\nChina has more than half of all capacity for refining lithium into chemicals that are used to make batteries that power EVs. Its dominance has sparked concerns in the US and with other countries competing to secure supplies of the key battery metals—which also include nickel and cobalt—needed in a global push to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources.\n\nThe only way for the US to have a chance of catching up to China, South Korea and Japan is to make it easier to build a supply chain in the country “and have the government clear the way to make sure that happens quickly,” Eric Norris, lithium president at Albemarle Corp., said in an interview. “It takes more than money,” he said on the sidelines of Fastmarkets Lithium Supply and Battery Raw Materials Conference in Phoenix.\n\nRead more: How a Battery Metals Squeeze Puts EV Future at Risk: QuickTake\n\nThe Biden administration added battery metals including lithium to the list of items covered by the 1950 Defense Production Act, which could help mining companies access $750 million to fund production at existing operations as well as productivity and safety upgrades and feasibility studies. The changes to the act do nothing to streamline the permitting process, which Norris said is vital in helping miners like Albemarle build a domestic supply chain.\n\nCritics worry that streamlining permitting would sacrifice environmental standards. The Biden administration has said it can improve the efficiency of permitting mines in the US while maintaining standards.\n\nStory continues\n\nSteps the government can take include clearing the way around the permit process for miners, creating tax incentives, and making it easier to build a supply chain in the US, Norris said. While there are discussions about reducing red tape and facilitating the permitting process, no concrete actions have been taken so far, according to Norris, who sees the Biden administration as trying to strike a balance between creating a domestic supply chain to enable more sustainable forms of energy with environmental concerns.\n\n“It’s hard to have your cake and eat it too,” Norris said. “If we want to rid the world of CO2, ozone depletion, we want to have EVs to enable that to happen, and we want to have a supply chain that isn’t dependent on a foreign country—which we may have at times of tensions from a geopolitical standpoint, like China—then these are things that have to be done to speed things along.”\n\nAlbemarle is in the process of restarting its Kings Mountain mine in North Carolina, reviving an operation that was idled in the 1980s. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company also plans to build a facility to convert raw lithium into the chemicals that go into EV batteries and is in the process of selecting a location. The site will likely be in southeastern US and a decision will be made later this year, according to Norris.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy You Should Quit Your Job After 10 Years Moving to Ban Juul, the FDA Delivers a Blow to Big Nicotine A Sci-Fi Novel’s Eerily Accurate Predictions About Today’s Tech Can Crypto’s Richest Man Stand the Cold?

"2022-06-27T22:40:19+00:00","Rating the 3 Electric Vehicle Stocks That Pay Dividends","Electric vehicle (EV) stocks have been among the most popular investment options for investors over the last few years. The industry performed extremely well on the back of a higher global EV adoption rate. Approximately 9% of global car sales were EVs in 2021, up from 4.1% in 2020 and 2.5% in 2019. This makes EV stocks a good investment for value investors to look into.\n\nAnother positive for EV stocks is that strong growth is likely to continue. In particular, there is government focus on reducing carbon emissions across nations. In the United States, President Joe Biden aims to have 50% of vehicles electric by 2030.\n\nAs the EV industry is still young and growing, most of the pure-play companies do not pay dividends. Hence, income-seeking investors should look to invest in original equipment manufacturers that are making a major shift toward EVs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n7 Butchered Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold\n\nLet’s take a look at these three EV companies from a value investor’s standpoint:\n\nTicker Company Price F Ford Motor Company $12.08 BYDDY BYD Company Limited $80.14 ALB Albemarle Corporation $227.25\n\nEV Stocks: Ford Motor (F) Ford (F) Go Electric Automobile Exhibition At Genoa, Italy.\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord Motor (NYSE:F) is the third-largest automaker in the U.S. with 13.5% market share as of the first quarter (Q1) of 2022. The company has survived even in the most turbulent times and maintained its dominant share in the industry.\n\nThe management seeks to maintain its position in the industry by investing in innovative technologies. Ford announced its plan to spend $50 billion in expanding its manufacturing capabilities for electric vehicles by 2026. The company aims to produce two million EVs globally. It is expected that Ford will have 50% of its cars electric by 2030.\n\nThe company also announced that it is forming a strategic alliance with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) to modernize Ford production. The partnership will incorporate artificial intelligence to enhance customer experience.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of May 2022, the company’s electric car sales have been doing quite well. EV sales during the month increased four times faster than the overall U.S. EV segment, up 221.5% year-over-year to 6,254 units.\n\nBased on the trailing twelve-month non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS), the company is currently trading at a multiple of 9.59x, which is a discount compared to the sector average of 10x. The average price target on the stock is $18.81, representing an upside potential of 55.07% from the current price. F stock’s dividend yield is 3.56%.\n\nBYD Company Limited (BYDDY) BYD Company Limited logo in front of their website. BYDDY stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nBased in China, BYD Company Limited (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) is one the leading manufacturers of electric and hybrid vehicles. The company also makes lithium-ion batteries and electronics such as smartphones, notebooks, PCs, and medical devices.\n\nMore than 95% of the company’s sales are derived from EVs. Management aims to completely scrap production of internal combustion engine vehicles.\n\nOver the last five years, BYD has been growing at an impressive double-digit compounded annual rate of 18.4%. It is the largest seller of new energy vehicles (NEVs) in the Chinese market, with sales approaching more than 1 million units.\n\nIn 2021, its top-selling electric models include Qin Plus DM, Han, Song DM, Tang SUV, and Yuan. The company’s strategy to offer lower-priced NEV models have made it popular among masses in China.\n\nBYD now intends to enter international markets, especially Europe. Other markets planned include India, Australia, Japan, and Latin America. The company is already manufacturing and selling electric buses in the U.S.\n\nWarren Buffett’s firm Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) holds a 7.7% stake in the company. BYD stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 2.8x, lower than its closest competitors Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) which stands at 11.3x, Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID), which stands at 237.6x, NIO (NYSE:NIO), which stands at 5.3x, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), which stands at 5.9x, and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV), which stands at 5.6x.\n\n7 Retirement Stocks to Buy in Unexpected Sectors\n\nThe company’s consistent track record of solid growth and a dividend yield of of 0.04% combined with a discounted valuation makes it attractive at the current price.\n\nEV Stocks: Albemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) is the largest producer and seller of specialty chemicals. The company’s products include lithium, bromine and catalysts.\n\nRising demand for lithium that helps in production of lithium-ion batteries used for powering EVs has significantly benefited companies like Albemarle. The company has been reporting strong results and has already raised the guidance twice after it Q1 2022, total revenues increased 36%, led by the strength in its lithium and bromine businesses. Full-year sales are expected to increase in the range of 74% to 86% to $5.8 billion to $6.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA should rise between 153% and 187%. Cash from operations are expected to be positive and increase between 60% and 147% to $550 million and $850 million.\n\nThe primary reason for the revised guidance has been Albemarle’s ability to renegotiate variable contracts for higher prices with lithium customers. The lithium business accounted for almost 41% of the company’s total revenue and 55% of its EBITDA. Average realized pricing is now expected to be up 140% from 100% estimated earlier.\n\nGiven Albemarle’s dominant position in the industry, it should be able to maintain its pricing power going forward, which should maintain growth momentum.\n\nI expect demand for lithium products will continue rising given a need for a cleaner and greener environment. The company is cash rich and has been consistently paying a dividend over the last 28 years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Sakshi Agarwalla did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

"2022-06-27T11:45:33+00:00","7 Top Lithium Stocks for the Second Half of 2022","Goldman Sachs just made lithium stocks even more attractive.\n\nJust days ago, the firm said that lithium prices could fall about 10% this year, and as much as 73% next year. But they’re wrong.  For one, as noted by Bloomberg, “Benchmark disputes Goldman’s forecast that a flood of new production is on its way, and that prices will crater as a result.” Benchmark also says the lithium market will remain short until 2025.\n\nMoreover, Bloomberg also noted that “Matt Fernley, the London-based managing director at Battery Materials Review, an industry researcher, said the sell side reports are ‘massively over-estimating’ the ease of adding new supply, and failing to consider the complexity of bringing new assets into production and the qualification requirements.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeanwhile, Time Magazine contributor Emily Barone added that “[w]hile the Earth has plenty of lithium to go around, the supply needs to be extracted from brine pools and underground reserves, and current mining operations aren’t sufficient to keep up with the auto industry’s growing needs.”\n\nSo, if you believe lithium prices are coming down soon, I have a bridge to sell you. With significant demand and little supply, prices won’t come down soon. I’m honestly not sure what Goldman Sachs was thinking. But we should thank the firm for making lithium stocks even more attractive than before.\n\n7 Retirement Stocks to Buy in Unexpected Sectors\n\nTherefore, let’s take a closer look at seven lithium stocks for investors to consider right now.\n\nTicker Company Price LAC Lithium Americas $21.82 SLI Standard Lithium $4.71 LTHM Livent Corp. $24.25 LIT Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF $75.80 BATT Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF $15.36 ALB Albemarle Corp. $224.79 PLL Piedmont Lithium $41.64\n\nLithium Stocks: Lithium Americas (LAC) Mobile phone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the past month, Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) stock has fallen more than 13% to just under $22 per share, where it’s now oversold.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, from current prices, I’d like to see it rally back to about $32 in the long term. Helping the cause is the fact that at its Thacker Pass mine, results of a Feasibility Study on the first phase of Thacker Pass now expects an an increased initial capacity of 40,000 tpa of lithium carbonate. This is up from the previously expected figure of at least 30,000-35,000 tpa of lithium carbonate.\n\nAlso, in April, Deutsche Bank analyst Corinne Blanchar raised the firm’s price target to $40 from $34, with a “Buy” rating. She believes lithium producers are well positioned with pricing improving. And with all of this combined, LAC stock looks like one of the top lithium stocks to consider.\n\nStandard Lithium (SLI) Graphic of Lithium scientific symbol (Li) in the shape of a big white gear with construction equipment and mountain around it\n\nSource: GrAl / Shutterstock.com\n\nSince the beginning of June, Standard Lithium (NYSEAMERICAN:SLI) slipped from just above $6 to now sitting at $4.71 per share. That said, from current prices, I’d like to see the stock retest $5.50 in the near term.\n\nAt the moment, Standard Lithium is working on a 3.14 tonne LCE Indicated Resource, a 150,000-acre joint venture Lanxess Project in Arkansas. “The region is home to North America’s largest brine production fairway with over five decades of commercial production, significant infrastructure, abundant low-cost electricity, access to chemical reagents and water sources. The project is already permitted for extensive brine extraction and processing activities,” the company said.\n\nFurthermore, in the past seven month, three analsysts have reiterated “Buy” ratings on SLI stock. In terms of price targets, the trio of analysts’ estimates range from a low of 13 CAD per share and 14.28 CAD per share.\n\nShould You Buy Apple Stock? Two Key Issues to Consider\n\nThus, investors should pay closer attention to SLI stock moving forward.\n\nLithium Stocks: Livent Corp. (LTHM) Livent Corporation logo on a phone screen. LTHM stock.\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nAnother solid lithium stock to consider is Livent Corp. (NYSE:LTHM), a pure play lithium producer. After dropping from about $34.61 at the end of May to a low of $21.71, LTHM stock became oversold. That said, from current prices, I’d like to see the stock retest at least $31 per share in the near term.\n\nRight now, the company has 16 offices or manufacturing facilities across the world — including its “largest and most diverse manufacturing facility” in North Carolina. It will also soon start phase two of its carbonate expansion in Argentina, with commercial production expected to begin by 2023.\n\nFurthermore, earnings are impressive, too. For the first quarter of 2022, company revenues were up 17% quarter-over-quarter (QOQ) to $143.5 million. Year-over-year (YOY), revenue was up 56%. Also, GAAP net income was 609% higher quarter over quarter at $53.2 million.\n\nIn other words, this is a strong company in a growing industry. And that could mean good things for investors looking for lithium stocks to buy.\n\nGlobal X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) a pile of lithium\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.com\n\nOne of my favorite ways to trade any hot sector is with an ETF, such as the Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:LIT).\n\nNot only does this ETF offer great diversification, but it also does so at a lower cost. At $75.62 per share, and with an expense ratio of 0.75%, the LIT ETF offers exposure to stocks, such as Albemarle (NYSE:ALB), BYD Co. (OTC:BYDDY), LG Chem (OTC:LGCLF), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Livent Corp., Lithium Americas Corp., Quantumscape Corp.

Since topping out around $273, ALB stock dropped to a low of $198. Now, it’s technically oversold and may be overdue for a pivot higher. And from current prices, I’d like to see ALB retest $270 shortly.\n\nIn May, the company boosted its guidance for the second time for the full year. It now expects 2022 sales to come in between $5.8 billion and $6.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to come in between $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion. And adjusted earnings per share (EPS) is expected to fall in between a range of $12.30 and $15.\n\n“Over the past 12 months, we’ve made significant progress in renegotiating more variable-priced contracts with our lithium customers. Implementation of these contracts is a key driver of the expected year-over-year improvement in our financial results,” CEO Kent Masters said. “We now expect full-year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be up more than 160% from prior year based on favorable market dynamics for our Lithium and Bromine businesses.”\n\n7 Stock Bargains Worth a Look After the Most Recent Pullback\n\nOverall, this is a great sign for Albemarle. And thus, is a good sign for ALB stock investors, as well as potential investors of lithium stocks.\n\nLithium Stocks: Piedmont Lithium (PLL) a lithium mine\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPiedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) fell from a high of about $67.50 to $47.50, where it’s starting to pivot higher.

"2022-06-24T15:58:03+00:00","Carpenter Technology (CRS) Down 29% in a Year: What's Ailing It?","Carpenter Technology Corporation’s CRS shares have declined 29.4% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 6.2%. The company is witnessing project delays owing to extended lead times for certain materials and the availability of outside contractors. Additionally, supply chain constraints and logistics disruptions are impairing its ability to meet production targets. These factors are denting the stock’s performance. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFactors Ailing the Stock\n\nCarpenter Technology is witnessing delays in some projects due to outside contractors’ availability and extended lead times for certain materials. Moreover, supply chains continue to see challenges, mainly around longer-than-anticipated lead times and ongoing logistics disruptions. These factors will likely impact the company’s ability to meet production targets.\r\n\r\nCRS is also bearing the brunt of Omicron-led isolations and challenges associated with hiring targeted production positions. Carpenter Technology’s transportation market suffers from chip shortages due to supply chain headwinds.\r\n \r\nThe company’s oil and gas submarket is witnessing a demand-supply imbalance. Supply shortages in this market has been further challenged by recent geopolitical disruptions. The market bore the brunt of reduced drilling activity in North America. Though the oil and gas sub-market activity in the United States is witnessing signs of recovery, the uptick in activity levels will likely remain below the pre-pandemic levels. Carpenter Technology has thus taken several actions to reduce production and selectively produce materials-based customer orders. The company’s decision to lower inventory continues to adversely impact the near-term results.\n\nIs Rebound Possible?\n\nCarpenter Technology is gaining from improved end-market demand, supported by record booking and strong backlog growth in third-quarter fiscal 2022. Management anticipates this momentum will continue through fiscal 2022. The industrial and consumer market is expected to witness continued strong demand for consumer electronics, IoT and semiconductor applications for its ultra-high-purity materials. In the transportation end-use market, demand in the light-duty submarket remains strong on increased customer spending.\r\n\r\nThe company has been witnessing broad-based demand recovery in the aerospace and defense and medical end-use market, which will continue in calendar 2022. Aerospace is gaining from strong lead times coupled with several contract wins. In defense, the company is benefiting from increased investments with customers on the development of the next-gen programs and platforms. Ongoing recovery in elective surgeries from the Omicron variant is driving the medical end-use market.  Medical procedures are expected to rise to pre-pandemic levels in the second half of the calendar year 2022. The company expects these trends will continue in the upcoming quarters.\r\n\r\nCarpenter Technology’s financial position is strong, which gives it the flexibility to strengthen its long-term growth profile by investing in emerging technologies like additive manufacturing and soft magnetics. As electric vehicle demand continues to grow and program activity increases for electrifying short-range air travel, the company is increasing investments in motor technology and soft magnetic solutions.\r\n\r\nThe company has been implementing cost-reduction initiatives and portfolio realignments that are anticipated to drive significant cost savings. It expects to spend nearly $90 million in capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 and prioritize capital investments to target the existing and future growth markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nCarpenter Technology currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Allegheny Technologies Inc.

DOW is benefiting from cost synergy savings and productivity initiatives, strong demand across a number of major markets and investment in high-return projects amid headwinds from higher raw material and energy costs.\r\n\r\nThe company’s shares are down 19.3% over a year, compared with a 14.6% decline recorded by its industry. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet’s find out why this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining at the moment.\n\nWhat’s Favoring DOW?\n\nDow is seeing higher demand across a number of markets including personal care, electronics and construction amid the ongoing economic recovery. It is also benefiting from strong demand for its materials across healthcare and packaging markets, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic has led to a surge in demand for health, hygiene and safety products.\r\n\r\nDow, in its first-quarter call, said that it expects demand strength across its end markets to continue. It sees strong demand across both consumer and industrial end markets in the second quarter of 2022. The company is well-placed to achieve mid-cycle earnings above pre-pandemic levels as it captures higher demand for lower carbon and circular solutions, it noted.\r\n\r\nThe company should also gain from cost synergy savings and productivity actions. It focuses on maintaining cost and operational discipline. The company is realizing a full $300 million EBITDA run rate benefit from restructuring programs being initiated in the third quarter of 2020.\r\n\r\nDow also remains focused on investing in attractive areas through highly accretive projects. It is investing in several high-return growth projects including the expansion of downstream silicones capacity. The company completed its Fort Saskatchewan expansion in 2021, which is expected to support higher polyethylene demand. Its fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation pilot plant in Louisiana is also expected to start up in fourth-quarter 2022 to manufacture propylene for coatings, electronics and durables markets.\r\n\r\nThe company is also committed to return value to its shareholders by leveraging healthy cash flows. It generated cash flow from operating activities of $1.6 billion and returned $1.1 billion to shareholders in the first quarter of 2022 through dividends and share repurchases. The company also announced a new $3 billion share buyback program.\n\nA Few Headwinds\n\nThe company is exposed to challenges from higher raw material costs. Raw material and logistical constraints are likely to persist in the second quarter. The company’s Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment faces headwinds from higher raw material costs and logistical challenges. This is expected to affect results in this segment. Dow also sees an unfavorable impact in the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure unit in the second quarter due to raw material inflation in Europe.\r\n\r\nDow also faces headwinds from higher energy costs. It expects higher energy costs in the second quarter, especially in Europe, which has witnessed a significant spike in costs. The company sees headwinds in the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment in the second quarter stemming from higher energy costs in Europe.\r\n\r\nTurnaround costs are also expected to affect the company’s results. It expects a roughly $125 million headwind in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment in the second quarter associated with a turnaround at its cracker and aromatics facilities in Louisiana. Dow also expects around $100 million headwind in the quarter related to turnarounds at its Stade and Terneuzen alkoxylate facilities.\n\nDow Inc. Price and Consensus Dow Inc.

"2022-06-22T20:42:58+00:00","FOCUS-Piedmont Lithium looks abroad amid North Carolina uncertainty","(Adds details from Piedmont's state filing, share price)\n\nBy Ernest Scheyder\n\nJune 22 (Reuters) - Piedmont Lithium Inc's first steps toward securing lithium supplies will be in Quebec or Ghana, not the United States, as an intensifying North Carolina regulatory review delays the miner's goal of anchoring America's electric vehicle battery renaissance.\n\nThe delay has forced Piedmont to expand its strategy beyond its proposed North Carolina mine - a project it has touted as the best way to help secure American energy independence, but one that now faces a regulatory quagmire - and fund mines abroad.\n\n""We think two of our projects will happen faster than our Carolina Lithium project: Quebec and Ghana,"" said Chief Executive Keith Phillips. ""The (North Carolina) regulators are doing a very good job. It's a rigorous process. It'll happen when it happens.""\n\nPiedmont was founded in 2016 in Australia but moved its headquarters last year to North Carolina, where it hopes to dig a 500-foot-deep (150 m-deep) open-pit mine in a $988 million project that would be one of the largest U.S. lithium mines.\n\nThe relocation was designed to be closer to EV manufacturing plants being built across the U.S. South by Toyota, SK Innovation and others.\n\nPiedmont signed a deal in 2020 to begin supplying Tesla Inc with lithium sometime between July 2022 and July 2023 from the North Carolina mine, but last year delayed the first shipments without a definitive date for when deliveries could begin. (Full story) https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/piedmont-says-has-delayed-timeline-supply-lithium-tesla-2021-08-02\n\nReuters reported last summer that Piedmont's chaotic roll out of that plan - in which it wooed Wall Street and Tesla before local residents - had fueled concerns about levels of dust, noise and vibrations in the area just outside Charlotte. (Full story) https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/push-supply-tesla-piedmont-lithium-irks-north-carolina-neighbors-2021-07-20\n\nStory continues\n\nThose issues are now the focus of the state mining review process that officials and the company itself acknowledge has no clear end date. Piedmont does not have an expectation for when its North Carolina facility will open.\n\nAs opposition to the North Carolina mine grew, Piedmont invested last year in Quebec-focused Sayona Mining Ltd and Ghana-focused Atlantic Lithium Ltd.\n\nMeanwhile, Albemarle Corp, the world’s biggest lithium miner, is hiring staff and buying land in a neighboring North Carolina county as it mulls re-opening a mothballed spodumene lithium mine that would compete directly with Piedmont.\n\nREGULATORY QUESTIONS\n\nNorth Carolina regulators asked Piedmont in January for more detail on 12 points they felt were not adequately explained in the company's mining permit application, according to regulatory filings.\n\nRegulators asked Piedmont to explain how the proposed mine could affect water table levels, as well as how to modify mine site blasting on cloudy days to limit dust that could affect a nearby airport's operations.\n\nThe state additionally has ""many concerns"" about Piedmont's plans to discharge chemicals into the public sewer system, according to the filings, and archaeologists have recommended that Piedmont erect a 25-foot buffer around four cemeteries at the mine site, a step that could force the company to change its development plans.\n\nPiedmont responded to the queries with more than 1,000 pages of data, charts and other information that was posted to the state regulatory website on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nShares of Piedmont fell 5.5% to close Wednesday at $46.38.\n\nWhile investor appetite for lithium stocks has been high in recent years, Piedmont has outperformed even among peers, hitting a record high near $80 this past spring before softening. In March, it booked $130.8 million in a secondary stock offering.\n\nSeven analysts rate Piedmont stock a ""buy"" with all expecting it to trade higher, according to Refinitiv Eikon.\n\nPiedmont said it has applied for U.S. Department of Energy loans, although the company would need to have its North Carolina permits before it would receive government support. The funds could not be used to dig mines in Quebec or Ghana.\n\nIn January 2021, Piedmont bought a roughly 20% stake in Sayona and its Quebec lithium projects. First production is expected next year.\n\nPiedmont also took a 9% stake in Ghana-focused Atlantic Lithium, and committed to spending $17 million on a feasibility study and $70 million on building Atlantic's Ewoyaa lithium project.\n\nThe market value of both investments has surged in the past year due in part to rising lithium prices. Piedmont will not operate the mines in Quebec or Ghana but has agreed to buy at least half of each company's production of a lightly processed type of lithium known as spodumene concentrate.\n\n""The potential for Piedmont to generate cash flow as early as 2023 is being overlooked by the market,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Reg Spencer, referring to Quebec.\n\nALBEMARLE LOOMS\n\nPushback from residents and regulators is not Piedmont's only problem in North Carolina.\n\nAlbemarle, which supplies Tesla, appears set to reopen its Kings Mountain, North Carolina, mine in a mining-friendly county near Piedmont's proposed site.\n\nIn March, it bought 60 acres (25 hectares) that abut that mine site, hinting at the company's future expansion plans. Albemarle has also recently posted job openings to help run the facility.\n\nAlbemarle is conducting initial geological tests and the project could open by 2027, spokesperson Kim Ronkin Casey said.\n\nLithium produced from spodumene rock can be used to make lithium hydroxide, which is prized by EV battery manufacturers partly because it holds a charge longer than the more-common lithium carbonate.\n\nThe United States does not have an active lithium spodumene mine, so the first one to open will garner huge interest from the country's nascent battery sector.\n\nAlbemarle said it has been sharing its plans widely with the local community, taking the opposite tack from Piedmont, which purposefully did not approach local residents with its plans for years.\n\n""There's a lot of work we're doing also with the community,"" said Eric Norris, head of Albemarle's lithium division. ""We've engaged them very early on.""\n\n(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Amran Abocar and Marguerita Choy)","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-piedmont-lithium-looks-abroad-204258767.html","ALB.US","AMC.F","PLL.AU","PLL.US","","","","","","","","","","","","","ALBEMARLE CORP","NORTH CAROLINA","PIEDMONT","QUEBEC","","","","","","","","0.995","0.024","0.9","0.076"

The new store will mark its first location in the city and the company’s 64th store location in the United States. The new store will open on Jun 27, 2022.\r\n\r\nGrowGeneration has also signed two store leases in North Chesterfield, VA and Hazelwood, MO, which will strengthen the company’s footprint in new and emerging markets. These stores are expected to be opened in the second half of the current year, taking the number of states the company operates to 16. These new stores will help growers with vertical farming demonstrations and educational support to set up and maintain state-of-the-art grow operations that will support them maximize their investments in vertical farming.\r\n\r\nThe new 40,000-square feet Mississippi store will help capture the Southeast’s emerging markets. Like Oklahoma, Mississippi is an ideal market for GrowGeneration’s one-stop shop as it provides unlimited medical cultivation licenses and new and existing cultivators seed to harvest solutions.\r\n\r\nGrowGeneration opened more than 9,000 licensed farms in Oklahoma City in the past three years since the city legalized medical cannabis production.

Full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance is expected to be within $10 million, down from the prior range of $30-$35 million. GRWG expects to open 10-15 stores this year. The company trimmed its target from the earlier planned 15-20 locations. The move supports its intention to refrain from building new stores in states where it already has a physical retail presence.\r\n\r\nGrowGeneration’s earnings and revenues in the March-end quarter were impacted by weakness in the cannabis industry. Comparable store sales in the quarter slumped 35.5% from the prior year’s levels at its 48 retail locations and e-commerce operations.\r\n\r\nThe company anticipates the ongoing revenue and gross profit headwinds to intensify in the second quarter.

ASH is benefiting from strong demand across its end markets and disciplined pricing actions amid supply-chain and logistics headwinds.\r\n\r\nShares of Ashland, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, have gained 10% over the past year against the 24.4% decline of its industry. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAshland’s restructuring actions have provided it with a profitable, high-margin portfolio focused on high-quality markets and better positioned it for future growth. It is benefiting from solid demand in most consumer end markets. Its industrial businesses are witnessing strong demand recovery. Ashland is seeing higher demand across core personal-care end markets. The company, in its fiscal second quarter call, noted that it expects underlying demand to remain strong for its focused ingredients and additives product portfolio. The company is also gaining from the contributions from the Schulke & Mayr acquisition.\r\n\r\nThe company is also taking a number of actions including reduction of operating costs to boost profitability. Cost-reduction measures are expected to support its margins in fiscal 2022. The company’s pricing measures are also contributing to its top line growth. It expects its pricing and mix improvement actions to cover the current inflation.\r\n\r\nAshland also remains committed to boosting its cash flows and returning value to shareholders. The company remains focused on expanding margins and improving free cash flow conversion. It recently raised its quarterly cash dividend by 12% to 33.5 cents per share. The company’s board also authorized a new, evergreen $500-million common stock repurchase program. The new authorization discontinues and replaces Ashland’s 2018 $1-billion share buyback program.\r\n\r\nHowever, tight raw material supply conditions are a concern. The company faces challenges from availability of raw materials. It is seeing a significant inflation in raw material and energy costs. Raw material and supply chain tightness are expected to continue in the short haul.\r\n\r\nThe company also faces headwinds from global logistics and shipping constraints. Ashland continued to witness higher freight and logistics costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The supply chain and logistics challenges are expected to persist over the near term. This might result in higher costs and weigh on the company’s margins. Pandemic-related lockdowns in China and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict are other concerns.\n\nAshland Global Holdings Inc. Price and Consensus Ashland Global Holdings Inc.

Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFMC Corp, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, is gaining from higher demand for its products, its portfolio strength and contributions of new products. The company is seeing healthy demand for its industry leading products, driven by strong global agricultural market fundamentals. The strong demand environment coupled with the company’s price increase actions is driving its top line. The company is actively taking price increase measures to mitigate the impact of cost inflation.\r\n\r\nThe company is well placed to capitalize on the underlying strength in global crop protection markets thanks to high commodity prices. It is seeing demand strength for diamides and insecticides in North America on higher crop commodity prices. Demand for Rynaxypyr brands continues to grow in the region. Strong demand is also being witnessed in corn, sugarcane and soybean applications in Brazil, aided by higher planted areas and high commodity prices. Demand for herbicides also remains strong in Australia. FMC Corp is also seeing strength in its insecticide portfolio in Asia.\r\n\r\nMoreover, FMC remains focused on boosting its market position and strengthening its product portfolio. It is investing in technologies and products as well as new launches to enhance value to the farmers. New products launched in Europe, North America and Asia are gaining significant traction and are contributing to volume growth. Product introductions are expected to support the company’s results this year.\r\n\r\nFMC also remains committed to return value to shareholders leveraging healthy cash flows. It expects to generate free cash flow of $515-$735 million in 2022. FMC Corp also expects to buy back stock worth $500-$600 million and pay dividends worth around $270 million in 2022.\r\n\r\nHowever, FMC Corp is exposed to headwinds from rising logistics and raw materials costs due to the intensified supply disruptions. The supply disruptions, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have resulted in rising costs of some raw materials and active ingredients. Along with higher packaging costs, raw material and logistics costs are likely to remain elevated through 2022. Pandemic-related shutdowns in China and elevated energy costs in Europe are the other concerns. Higher raw materials and logistics costs might impact the company’s performance.\r\n\r\nThe company also faces challenges from unfavorable currency swings. It is particularly challenged by currency headwinds associated with the weakening of European currencies. Currency headwinds are expected to drag the company’s performance in 2022.\n\nFMC Corporation Price and Consensus FMC Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nFMC Corporation price-consensus-chart | FMC Corporation Quote\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nBetter-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include Nutrien Ltd.

In this time frame, it has delivered an earnings surprise of 4.6%, on average.\n\nUpbeat Prospects\n\nElement Solutions is benefiting from strategic acquisitions, cost management measures and strong demand in its end markets. It is seeing continued strength in its high-end electronics business. The company benefited from strong demand across many of its major end-markets in the first quarter, leading to a 24% year-over-year rise in its top line. It is also seeing strong demand in general industrial and energy markets. It is benefiting from strength in construction, general manufacturing and aerospace end markets, which is offsetting weakness in automotive.\r\n\r\nThe company also stands to benefit from strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of H.K. Wentworth is expected to boost growth in its electronics portfolio. The buyout of Coventya also expands its offerings across industrial surface treatment markets and offer significant synergies. The recently completed HSO buyout also adds technology to the company’s industrial surface treatment business.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Kester acquisition has added capabilities and scale to the company’s existing electronics assembly materials business. The acquisition of DMP has also expanded Element Solutions’ investment in technology to offer innovative solutions. The cash proceeds from the divestment of its Agricultural Solution Unit have also enabled Element Solutions to invest in strategic markets and pursue mergers and acquisitions.\r\n \r\nElement has been executing various reorganization and cost management measures that have contributed to cost savings and profits. Continued cost discipline and other strategic actions are expected to support margins and act as tailwinds in 2022.\r\n\r\nThe company is also using its cash strategically and remains committed to boosting shareholders' returns. It deployed $43 million of capital in the first quarter. The remaining availability under its current stock buyback authorization was $713 million at the end of the first quarter. The company also anticipates generating free cash flow of between $310-$325 million for 2022. It continues to look for opportunities to deploy excess capital.\n\nStory continues\n\nElement Solutions Inc. Price and Consensus Element Solutions Inc.

Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nReliance Steel, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, is optimistic about the business environment in 2022 and sees robust underlying demand in the majority of its end markets. Demand in non-residential construction, the company’s biggest market, improved in the first quarter of 2022 after being affected by typical year-end seasonality in the fourth quarter. The company expects non-residential construction activities to strengthen through 2022, aided by strong booking trends.\r\n\r\nReliance Steel is also witnessing strength in semiconductors and continued recovery in the energy (oil and natural gas) market. Demand in the heavy industry for both agricultural and construction equipment also continued to improve in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company is also seeing healthy demand for the toll processing services that it provides to the automotive market despite the impact of global microchip shortages on production levels. Additionally, demand in commercial aerospace is improving on higher activities.\r\n\r\nThe company has also been following an aggressive acquisition strategy for a while as part of its core business policy to drive operating results. Its latest acquisitions of Rotax Metals, Admiral Metals and Nu-Tech Precision Metals are in sync with its strategy of investing in high-quality businesses.\r\n\r\nRotax Metals diversifies the company's products by widening its portfolio of specialty bronze, brass and copper products. Massachusetts-based Admiral Metals’ strong reputation in the metal industry with high levels of customer service and next-day delivery flexibility promises to further solidify Reliance Steel’s position.\r\n\r\nNu-Tech’s reputation in the key markets that it serves through its proprietary processes and quality certifications and its support for Reliance Steel’s customer, product and geographical diversification strategies make it a solid choice. RS anticipates the acquisition to aid its growth in the nuclear, aerospace and other industries.\r\n\r\nHigher metals prices are also driving the company’s performance and will likely continue to support the top line and margins. Average prices per ton sold in the first quarter went up roughly 58% year over year to $3,186. The company anticipates its average selling price per ton sold to be flat to up 2% sequentially in the second quarter of 2022 driven by its diverse product mix and strength in demand and pricing.\n\nReliance Steel & Aluminum Co.

The bottom line surged 151% year on year thanks to strong end-market demand and exceptional operational execution.\r\n\r\nIncluding one-time items, the company achieved EPS of $2.54 in the fiscal third quarter compared with the prior-year quarter’s $1.07.\r\n\r\nNet sales in the reported quarter came in at $2,516 million compared with the year-ago quarter’s $1,845 million.

"2022-06-17T12:45:17+00:00","7 Lithium Stocks to Sell if You Believe the Boom Is Over","Top investment bank Goldman Sachs believes that the bull market for lithium is over. The bank sees prices on a downward trajectory for the next couple of years, with a substantial correction from today’s levels.\n\nMoreover, it is of the view that today’s lithium prices are a “fundamental mispricing [that] has, in turn, generated an outsized supply response well ahead of the demand trend in focus.” Consequently, the report led to a selloff in lithium stocks with massive losses across the board.\n\n7 Tempting Tech Stocks to Pull the Trigger on Now\n\nIt is imperative to understand that the macro-economic elements weakening the outlook on stocks will subside at some point. However, with lower demand, the demand for materials needed, including lithium, is dropping at an incredible pace. Therefore, here are seven lithium stocks you should probably avoid now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPLL Piedmont Lithium $49.27 CBAT CBAK Energy Technology $1.03 SLI Standard Lithium $3.9 LIACF American Lithium $1.415 TSLA Tesla $628.84 ALB Albemarle Corporation $199.33 SQM Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile $87.57\n\nPiedmont Lithium (PLL)  Graphic of Lithium scientific symbol (Li) in the shape of a big white gear with construction equipment and mountain around it\n\nSource: GrAl / Shutterstock.com\n\nPiedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) aims to become an integrated lithium producer but might wind up being nothing more of a lithium processor.\n\nIts primary project is located in Gaston County, North Carolina, where it expects to produce roughly 30,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide from more than 200,000 tons of spodumene each year. However, Piedmont’s regulatory troubles have gotten it in hot water, which cast a shadow of uncertainty on its future.\n\nThe company doesn’t have permits for its project from either the state or the local government. Moreover, it faces strong opposition from the Gaston County Board, which is responsible for granting permission to develop the mine. Despite everything hanging in the balance, PLL stock trades at a lofty valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nCBAK Energy Technology (CBAT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for CBAK Energy Technology (CBAT)\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nCBAK Energy Technology (NASDAQ:CBAT) is an EV lithium-ion battery producer in Mainland China. The market is remarkably competitive, full of smaller competitors that continue gobbling up CBAK’s market share.\n\nMoreover, the company’s clientele market share is limited to a few customers, which account for over 50% of its sales. Hence, losing one customer will result in a huge blow to its fundamentals. Additionally, our stock has fallen out of favor with its investors, having shed over 70% of its value in the past 12 months.\n\nRecently, CBAK announced its acquisition of a troubled battery materials supplier in Hitrans Lithium Battery Technology. CBAK claims that Hirans generated roughly four times its revenues during the first nine months of last year.\n\n7 Unstoppable Stocks to Own in 2022\n\nHowever, filings have shown that the acquired company’s financials are extremely weak, with large cash deficits. Hence, with plenty of uncertainties surrounding its business, CBAK stock remains a highly risky bet in its sector.\n\nLithium Stocks: Standard Lithium (SLI) a pile of lithium. Lithium Stocks\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.com\n\nStandard Lithium (NYSEAMERICAN:SLI) develops extraction technologies that can effectively utilize bromine extraction infrastructure to produce battery-ready lithium salts.\n\nThough it’s still early days in the development of its plant, there is significant potential for creating a massive lithium source down the line.\n\nStrong evidence supports the need for Lithium due to the proliferation of EVs and battery storage. Therefore, the risk lies in its execution abilities and production process. SLI expects a whopping $1 billion in capital expenditures based on $4 billion in project returns.\n\nFeasibility information is lacking, which has led to massive uncertainty surrounding the stock. Moreover, it only has $100 million in cash at this time, which points to future dilution and debt increases.\n\nAmerican Lithium (LIACF) lithium (LI) on the periodic table. Lithium Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Lithium (OTCMKTS:LIACF) focuses on developing leading lithium projects in the Americas. It’s a penny stock that gained incredibly in 2020 from multiple catalysts.\n\nHowever, the movement in stock price wasn’t related to the company fundamentals. The company is a pre-revenue business that needs constant cash flow injections to stay afloat. Naturally, it could pay off in the long run if it hits big in the coming years. However, the chances of its success seem minimal at this time.\n\nLithium demand is expected to rise at a staggering pace over the next several years. Analysts at McKinsey report that demand for lithium could rise from an estimated 500,000 metric tons in 2021 to three to four million metric tons by 2030.\n\n7 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever\n\nHence, American Lithium and other lithium producers will continue to float up and down regardless of their competencies and quality of fundamentals.\n\nLithium Stocks: Tesla (TSLA) Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) logo displayed on a phone in front of a blurred image of Elon Musk\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an O.G. in the EV sector which has also been the most successful business in the burgeoning niche.\n\nUnlike several EV start-ups that have emerged over the past couple of years, it’s a business that continues to thrive and is delivering real cars to real people. Its fundamentals are impressive from top to bottom, and have kicked into overdrive of late.\n\nWith the rising metal prices, Elon Musk recently tweeted about Tesla getting into the lithium mining and refining business. Musk said that though there is no shortage of lithium, the pace of refinement is slow. Moreover, the “Price of lithium has gone to insane levels.” It remains to be seen how successful the business might turn out to be in terms of improving supply and limiting costs.\n\nNevertheless, TSLA stock’s meteoric price remains a bone of contention, with it trading over 50 times enterprise value to EBITDA.\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) is a leading lithium conglomerate business that has been one of the most consistent performers in its niche. Its operations are highly diversified from a geographic standpoint, which gives it the edge over its competition.\n\nMoreover, the variety of locations it operates in gives it a unique advantage in dealing with different governments.  The stability of its business is linked to the stability of its mines, which has plenty to do ALB’s relationship with various governments.  Nevertheless, it has established itself as a juggernaut in the sector, and it’s in the best position to capitalize on the demand for lithium.\n\n7 Great Dividend Stocks Under $25\n\nThere are, however, plenty of risks to consider with ALB stock. Firstly, it trades at a nosebleed valuation of 4.70 times forward sales estimates. Moreover, it is always at the mercy of governments and institutions, which could significantly hamper its business.\n\nLithium Stocks: Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM) Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's web page on it. Lithium Stocks\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) is a specialty chemicals company involved in producing and distributing plant nutrients and derivatives. Its nutrients and minerals are in use for various applications, including batteries and lithium derivatives. Moreover, it’s been a top performer in the sector, growing sales and EBITDA by over 100% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThough there’s plenty to like about SQM, Chilean lithium faces immense political risks. Social Convergence, a left-leaning party, recently won the elections in Chile, and the parliament subsequently voted to repeal the current constitution.\n\nSQM enjoyed a privileged position under the old constitution. The consensus is that the new Chilean government will be looking to nationalize the production of copper and lithium. If that’s the case, then SQM and its stockholders could be in a world of trouble.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\n$200 Oil Sooner Than You Think – Buy This Now Stock Prodigy Who Found NIO at $2… Says Buy THIS Early Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air” It doesn’t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

"2022-06-17T11:40:45+00:00","Are Albemarle Corporation's (NYSE:ALB) Mixed Financials The Reason For Its Gloomy Performance on The Stock Market?","Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) has had a rough week with its share price down 16%. We, however decided to study the company's financials to determine if they have got anything to do with the price decline. Fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes so it makes sense to study the company's financials. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Albemarle's  ROE today.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Albemarle\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Albemarle is:\n\n6.0% = US$364m ÷ US$6.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nAlbemarle's Earnings Growth And 6.0% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Albemarle's ROE doesn't look very promising. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 17%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. Accordingly, Albemarle's low net income growth of 3.5% over the past five years can possibly be explained by the low ROE amongst other factors.\n\nWe then compared Albemarle's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 7.8% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is ALB worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether ALB is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs Albemarle Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nWhile Albemarle has a decent three-year median payout ratio of 36% (or a retention ratio of 64%), it has seen very little growth in earnings. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.\n\nAdditionally, Albemarle has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 9.7% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 18% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.\n\nSummary\n\nIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Albemarle's performance. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

CF is well-positioned to capitalize on the rising nitrogen fertilizer demand in major markets and higher nitrogen prices amid headwinds from a spike in natural gas costs.\r\n\r\nCF Industries, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, is gaining from strong nitrogen fertilizer demand. Global demand for nitrogen is expected to remain strong in 2022. Higher crop commodity prices are contributing to healthy demand globally. Industrial demand has also recovered from the pandemic-related disruptions. In 2022, demand for nitrogen is expected to be driven by favorable industrial and economic activities and high levels of corn planted acres in the United States. Demand for urea imports from Brazil and India is also expected to be strong this year. Higher crop prices, high levels of planted corn acres and improved farm economics are likely to increase demand in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe company, on its first-quarter call, said that it sees strong global nitrogen industry dynamics for the foreseeable future with robust global nitrogen demand along with tight nitrogen supply worldwide and wide energy differentials between North America and marginal production in Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nThe company is also benefiting from higher nitrogen prices on the back of lower supply resulting from reduced operating rates across Europe and Asia due to higher energy prices. Higher nitrogen prices are driving its sales as witnessed in the last-reported quarter. The positive pricing environment is expected to continue moving ahead. Global nitrogen supply is expected to remain challenged due to higher energy prices in Europe and Asia along with export restrictions across certain countries.\r\n\r\nCF Industries also remains committed to boosting shareholders’ value by leveraging strong cash flows. It generated cash flow from operations of $1,391 million in the first quarter, up around 141% year over year. The company repurchased around 1.3 million shares for $100 million during the quarter. Its board also raised its quarterly dividend by 33% to 40 cents per share.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company is facing headwinds from higher natural gas costs, stemming from an increase across Europe and Asia. The average cost of natural gas reflected in its cost of sales increased to $6.48 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in the first quarter of 2022 from $3.22 per MMBtu in the year-ago quarter. Gas costs are expected to remain elevated in Europe through the end of 2022 due to the uncertainties over the supply from Russia. High natural gas costs are expected to increase the company’s cost of sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nCF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

"2022-06-15T12:18:12+00:00","Why You Should Retain Air Products (APD) Stock in Your Portfolio","Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. APD is expected to benefit from its investments in high-return industrial gas projects and productivity measures amid headwinds including higher energy costs.\r\n\r\nThe company’s shares are down 20.3% over a year, compared with a 12.5% decline recorded by its industry.\r\n\r\nLet’s find out why this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining at the moment. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat’s Aiding APD?\n\nAir Products is well-positioned to gain from its project investments, new business deals, acquisitions and cost and productivity initiatives. It remains committed to its gasification strategy and is executing its growth projects. The company has a total available capacity to deploy (over fiscal 2018-2027) around $34.2 billion in high-return investments aimed at creating significant shareholder value. It has already spent or committed roughly 74% of the capacity. These projects are expected to be accretive to the company’s earnings and cash flows.\r\n\r\nThe company, in October 2021, completed the asset acquisition and project financing transactions of the $12-billion Jazan project in in Saudi Arabia. It expects to close the Phase Two of this project in 2023. Last year, Air Products also announced the $4.5 billion world-class clean energy complex in Louisiana. The project, the company’s largest-ever investment, is expected to produce more than 750 million standard cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen for local and global markets by 2026.\r\n\r\nAir Products, in Apr 2022, also purchased Air Liquide's industrial gases business in the United Arab Emirates (""UAE""), including liquid bulk, packaged gases and specialty gases. APD also acquired Air Liquide's majority share in MECD, which owns and operates a liquid CO2 manufacturing site in Bahrain. By purchasing these businesses, Air Products broadened its footprint and regional presence in the UAE and Bahrain\r\n\r\nThe company also has also been benefiting from higher pricing. Higher merchant demand is also driving its volumes. Moreover, it is boosting productivity to improve its cost structure. It is seeing the positive impacts of its productivity actions. Benefits from additional productivity and cost improvement programs are likely to support its margins this year.\n\nA Few Headwinds\n\nAir Products is exposed to challenges from cost inflation. It is witnessing higher power costs in its merchant business. The company is seeing significantly higher energy costs, especially in EMEA due to the considerably high natural gas and electricity costs. It is expected to continue to face headwinds from the power cost inflation moving ahead. As such, higher power costs are likely to weigh on margins over the near term.\r\n\r\nThe company also faces volume pressure in the Americas segment due to maintenance outages. Hydrogen volumes fell on a sequential comparison basis in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 due to outages. The company expects high levels of planned outages in the fiscal third quarter. As such, volumes are expected to remain under pressure over the near term. Maintenance outages have also pushed up costs in this segment.\n\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc.

"2022-06-15T12:17:12+00:00","Here's Why You Should Buy Methanex (MEOH) Stock Right Now","Methanex Corporation’s MEOH stock looks promising at the moment. The company is benefiting from higher demand and pricing for methanol, aided by strong industry conditions. We are positive on the company’s prospects and believe that the time is right for you to add the stock to the portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.\r\n\r\nMethanex carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best investment opportunities for investors.\r\n\r\nLet’s take a look into the factors that make Methanex an attractive choice for investors right now.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nShares of Methanex have gained 26.2% over the past year against the 12.5% decline of its industry. It has also outperformed the S&P 500’s roughly 11.9% decline over the same period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEstimates Northbound\n\nOver the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Methanex for 2022 has increased around 31%. The consensus estimate for second-quarter 2022 has also been revised 37% upward over the same time frame. The favorable estimate revisions instill investor confidence in the stock.\n\nSolid Growth Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2022 for Methanex is currently pegged at $7.90, reflecting an expected year-over-year growth of 31%. Earnings are also expected to register a 61.3% growth in second-quarter 2022.\n\nValuation Looks Attractive\n\nMethanex’s shares are currently trading at a level that is lower than the industry average, suggesting that the stock still has upside potential.\r\n\r\nGoing by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, which is often used to value chemical stocks, Methanex is currently trading at trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 4.04, cheaper compared with the industry average of 6.26.\n\nGrowth Drivers in Place\n\nMethanex is gaining from healthy demand for methanol on the back of the ongoing economic recovery. The strong fundamentals of the methanol industry are driving its results. The company is seeing healthy demand for methanol from traditional chemical applications.\r\n\r\nThe company is also benefiting from an upswing in methanol pricing. Strong methanol demand coupled with ongoing industry supply challenges and high global energy prices is driving methanol prices. The company’s average realized price for methanol rose roughly 17% year over year in the first quarter of 2022. Higher demand and strong prices are driving its top line.\r\n\r\nMethanex also remains committed to strengthen its balance sheet and maintain its strong liquidity position. It is well placed to maintain its business, execute attractive growth opportunities and continue the long track record of returning excess cash to shareholders through dividend payouts and share repurchases.\r\n\r\nThe Geismar 3 project is also expected to bolster the company's portfolio and support its future cash generation. The construction of the project is progressing according to plan and is on track to be completed on-time and within budget by late 2023 or early 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nMethanex Corporation Price and Consensus Methanex Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nMethanex Corporation price-consensus-chart | Methanex Corporation Quote\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nOther top-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include Nutrien Ltd.

"2022-06-14T15:02:03+00:00","Here's Why Commercial Metals (CMC) is an Attractive Bet Now","Commercial Metals Company CMC looks attractive at the moment, aided by solid finished steel demand stemming from robust construction and infrastructure activities and higher steel prices. The company’s Europe segment is benefiting from solid growth in the Polish construction market while new contract wins and strong construction backlog continue to support the North America segment. The company’s network optimization efforts and ramping up of new steel mills will continue to drive growth.\n\nFactors Detailing\n\nPositive Earnings Surprise History: Commercial Metals, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 15.9%, on average.\r\n\r\nPositive Growth Expectations: The company’s earnings estimate for fiscal 2022 is pegged at $8.75, suggesting year-over-year growth of around 147.8%.\r\n\r\nStrong Financials: The company’s strong liquidity, financial position and focus on reducing debt by a strategic capital allocation approach will stoke growth. The company’s net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio is pegged at 0.5 at the end of the fiscal second quarter, while net debt to capitalization is just 14%. This further underscores the company's ability to meet debt obligations. It had total liquidity of $1.5 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter.\r\n\r\nPrice Performance: The company’s shares have gained 12.4% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 10.4%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth Drivers\n\nCommercial Metals will continue to benefit from robust finished steel demand across most of its product lines, supported by its growing downstream backlog and solid levels of new construction work entering the project pipeline. Solid highway infrastructure activities and healthy construction markets in North America are driving strong rebar and wire rods demand.\r\n\r\nDemand conditions within Central Europe remain strong. The Polish construction market continues to grow, while consumption of merchant and wire rod products is supported by expanding manufacturing activity in Poland. The company believes that seasonal factors, new contract wins, strong construction backlog in North America and strength across the key end markets in North America and Europe will continue supporting the solid steel shipment volumes in third-quarter fiscal 2022.\r\n\r\nCMC will benefit from higher steel prices, thanks to demand upsurge in major end-use markets and tight supply conditions partly due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and hefty Section 232 tariffs on steel imports.\r\n\r\nCommercial Metals continue to gain from its network optimization efforts, generating additional margin and reducing costs in the near future. The company is progressing with constructing a third micro mill Arizona 2, which will be the world's first mill to produce merchant bar quality (MBQ) steel products. The new mill will provide the company with 400 thousand tons of rebar capacity to serve incremental infrastructure demand and about 150 thousand tons of merchant bar. The company ramped up the construction of its fourth new micro mill, MM4, which will enhance its position in the Eastern United States and boost its ability to serve markets in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. Both MM4 and Arizona projects will receive 1.2 trillion in funding over the five years under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed last November.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Stocks to Consider\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Allegheny Technologies Inc.

Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat’s Favoring KRO?\n\nForecast-topping earnings performance in the first quarter and upbeat prospects have contributed to the run-up in the company's shares.

Based on strong demand, TiO2 selling prices are projected to increase through the balance of the year. Kronos Worldwide also expects its sales and income from operations for 2022 to be higher on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nKronos Worldwide is expected to benefit from higher demand for TiO2. Higher demand in European and North American markets are likely to drive its TiO2 sales volumes. New product development, a solid customer base and effective marketing strategies are also working in the company’s favor.\r\n\r\nThe company is also gaining from higher selling prices. Its average TiO2 selling prices rose 7% on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter. The company is expected to continue to benefit from higher TiO2 selling prices in the second quarter of 2022 on strong consumer demand.\r\n\r\nEarnings estimates for Kronos Worldwide have also been going up over the past two months, reflecting analysts’ optimism.

Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat’s Going in CE’s Favor?\n\nCelanese is benefiting from its cost and productivity actions, investments in high-return organic projects and synergies of acquisitions. The company is also gaining from higher demand in most of its end markets.\r\n\r\nThe company continues to actively pursue acquisitions, which are providing it opportunities for additional growth, investment and synergies. The acquisitions of SO.F.TER., Nilit and Omni Plastics are expected to contribute to earnings expansion in the company's Engineered Materials segment. The Elotex acquisition also strengthened the company’s position in the vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions space. The buyout is expected to contribute to volumes in the Acetyl Chain segment.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of Exxon Mobil's Santoprene business also broadens the company’s portfolio of engineered solutions and enables it to offer a wider range of functionalized solutions to targeted growth areas, including future mobility, medical and sustainability. Celanese expects the acquisition to be accretive to its 2022 adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow.\r\n\r\nCelanese, in Feb 2022, also entered into an agreement with DuPont to acquire the majority of the latter’s Mobility & Materials segment for cash proceeds of $11 billion. Through this deal, Celanese will be able to enhance its growth in high-value applications. It expects to achieve run-rate synergies of around $450 million within the first four years following the completion of the deal. The buyout is expected to be immediately accretive to the company’s adjusted earnings per share.\r\n\r\nCelanese also remains focused on executing its productivity programs that include the implementation of a number of cost reduction capital projects. Productivity actions are expected to support to its margins.\r\n\r\nThe company also continues to generate strong cash flows and is focused on boosting shareholders’ value. It returned $73 million to shareholders through dividend payouts during the first quarter of 2022.\n\nA Few Concerns\n\nThe company faces headwinds from raw material cost inflation due to supply constraints as witnessed in the last reported quarter. It is witnessing sustained inflation across many key raw materials as well as supply chain costs. Tight availability is expected to keep raw material costs elevated over the near term. Higher input costs are expected to affect margins in the second quarter of 2022. Celanese also expects continued moderation in the Acetyl Chain pricing conditions.\r\n\r\nThe semiconductor shortage is also hurting automotive OEM production around the world. The chip crisis has been exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Weaker automotive production is likely to affect the company’s automotive order patterns over the near term.\n\nCelanese Corporation Price and Consensus Celanese Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nCelanese Corporation price-consensus-chart | Celanese Corporation Quote\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nBetter-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include Nutrien Ltd.

"2022-06-08T13:00:01+00:00","Want Better Returns? Don't Ignore These 2 Basic Materials Stocks Set to Beat Earnings","Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Commercial Metals (CMC) earns a Zacks Rank #2 eight days from its next quarterly earnings release on June 16, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.20 a share.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $2.20 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Commercial Metals has an Earnings ESP of 10%.\n\nCMC is part of a big group of Basic Materials stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Albemarle (ALB) as well.\n\nAlbemarle is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on August 3, 2022. ALB's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.81 a share 56 days from its next earnings release.\n\nAlbemarle's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 6.24% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.65.\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, CMC and ALB could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nStory continues\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

"2022-06-08T12:32:12+00:00","US Chemicals Set for Solid Growth Despite Supply Chaos: 5 Picks","The American chemical industry is poised to have its best year in more than a decade in 2022 notwithstanding the ongoing supply-chain snafus, according to the newly released “Mid-Year 2022 Chemical Industry Situation and Outlook” by the American Chemistry Council (“ACC”). The industry is expected to deliver solid growth this year riding on firm demand across several end markets, inventory rebuilding and the competitive advantage in natural gas-based chemistries.\r\n\r\nThe Washington, DC-based chemical industry trade group said that the solid expansion in chemical output in 2022, which follows several years of weak growth associated with trade tensions, the coronavirus pandemic and disruptive weather events, will be driven by growth across all chemistries.\r\n\r\nThis scenario bodes well for U.S. chemical stocks. Companies like Huntsman Corporation HUN, Albemarle Corporation ALB, Kronos Worldwide, Inc. KRO, The Chemours Company CC and Univar Solutions Inc. UNVR are poised to benefit from the positive outlook.\n\nThe ACC envisions total domestic chemical output to rise 4.1% in 2022, following a 1.6% growth last year. Basic chemicals production is also forecast to climb 4.3% with bulk petrochemicals and organics, plastic resins and inorganic chemicals are expected to rack up the biggest gains. Specialty chemicals output is projected to expand 6.2% driven by strong demand and restocking. Capital spending is projected to climb 12.3% to $34.5 billion in 2022.\r\n\r\nWhile the global economy remains hamstrung by supply chain issues and inflation, made worse by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and pandemic-related lockdowns in China, slower growth in consumer spending and shifting consumption patterns away from goods will help ease some pressure, the ACC noted.  The trade group expects industrial production to increase 3.9% in 2022.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, U.S. chemical trade witnessed a strong rebound in 2021, increasing 26.8% year over year to $281.4 billion. Chemical exports climbed 22.3% while imports went up 32.7% last year, driven by petrochemicals trade. The ACC expects nominal chemical exports to rise 13.3% to $173.5 billion in 2022. Imports are predicted to climb 19.7% this year.\r\n\r\nOn the chemical end-use market front, vehicles sales are projected to tick up to 15.1 million units in 2022. Light vehicles remain challenged by the semiconductor shortage. Notwithstanding the recovery in vehicle assemblies, shipping constraints and disruptions to supply chains for vehicles and parts are limiting supply, the ACC noted. The trade group expects pent-up demand to support sales once supply-chain bottlenecks ease.\r\n\r\nThe ACC also sees housing starts to rise to 1.65 million in 2022 after increasing to 1.60 million in 2021. While higher prices and mortgage rates are headwinds to further expansion, gains in employment, wages, and household formations are supportive factors. Notably, light vehicles and housing are major end markets for chemicals.\n\nStory continues\n\n5 Chemical Stocks Worth a Wager\n\nThe U.S. chemical industry is poised for an upswing this year on strong end-market demand despite the headwinds from supply-chain disruptions. Amid such a backdrop, it would be prudent to invest in chemical stocks with compelling growth prospects.\r\n\r\nWe highlight the following five stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that are good options for investment right now. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nHuntsman: Texas-based Huntsman remains focused on growing its downstream specialty and formulation businesses. The company's Polyurethanes segment is well positioned for strong upside in the long term on the back of its focus on ramping up its high-value differentiated downstream portfolio. HUN should also gain from significant synergies of acquisitions. Its strong liquidity and balance sheet leverage gives it adequate flexibility to continue to develop and expand its core businesses through acquisitions and internal investments.\r\n\r\nHuntsman has an expected earnings growth rate of 26.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HUN's current-year earnings has been revised 11.7% upward over the last 60 days. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters at an average of 12.6%.\r\n\r\nAlbemarle: North Carolina-based Albemarle is benefiting from higher volumes in its lithium business on continued recovery in global economic activities. Healthy customer orders and plant productivity improvements are supporting volumes. Higher lithium prices due to tight market conditions are also supporting its performance.

The company has also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 22.5%.\r\n\r\nKronos Worldwide: Texas-based Kronos is gaining from higher demand for titanium dioxide (TiO2). Higher demand in European and North American markets are likely to drive its TiO2 sales volumes. KRO is also gaining from an uptick in TiO2 selling prices, supported by strong consumer demand and rising costs. New product development, a solid customer base and effective marketing strategies are also working in the company’s favor.\r\n\r\nKronos has an expected earnings growth rate of 110.2% for the current year. The consensus estimate for KRO's current-year earnings has been revised 60.9% upward over the last 60 days.\r\n\r\nChemours: Based in Delaware, Chemours is benefiting from a rebound in demand from the coronavirus-led downturn, strong execution and its cost-cutting actions. It is witnessing increasing adoption of the Opteon platform. Demand for Opteon remains strong in mobile and stationary applications. CC’s cost-reduction program along with its productivity and operational improvement actions across its businesses are also expected to support margins.\n\nChemours has an expected earnings growth rate of 30.5% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the current year has been revised 15.2% upward over the last 60 days. CC beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters. In this time frame, it has delivered an average earnings surprise of roughly 28.7%.\r\n\r\nUnivar: Illinois-based Univar is benefiting from market share gains, operational execution, acquisitions, cost minimization and a robust liquidity position. UNVR remains committed to cost-cutting, expense management and productivity actions that are helping it minimize operational costs and boost margins. The acquisition of Nexeo Solutions has also further enhanced the company’s capabilities and accelerated its ability to create significant value for customers, supplier partners, employees and shareholders. The buyout of Brazilian ingredients and specialty chemicals distributor Sweetmix is also anticipated to drive growth for the company’s Food Ingredients portfolio in Brazil and generate growth and cost synergies.\r\n\r\nUnivar has a projected earnings growth rate of 46.9% for the current year. UNVR's consensus estimate for the current year has been revised 23.9% upward over the last 60 days.
