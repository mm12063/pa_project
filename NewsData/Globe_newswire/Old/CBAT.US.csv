"2022-06-17T12:45:17+00:00","7 Lithium Stocks to Sell if You Believe the Boom Is Over","Top investment bank Goldman Sachs believes that the bull market for lithium is over. The bank sees prices on a downward trajectory for the next couple of years, with a substantial correction from today’s levels.\n\nMoreover, it is of the view that today’s lithium prices are a “fundamental mispricing [that] has, in turn, generated an outsized supply response well ahead of the demand trend in focus.” Consequently, the report led to a selloff in lithium stocks with massive losses across the board.\n\n7 Tempting Tech Stocks to Pull the Trigger on Now\n\nIt is imperative to understand that the macro-economic elements weakening the outlook on stocks will subside at some point. However, with lower demand, the demand for materials needed, including lithium, is dropping at an incredible pace. Therefore, here are seven lithium stocks you should probably avoid now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPLL Piedmont Lithium $49.27 CBAT CBAK Energy Technology $1.03 SLI Standard Lithium $3.9 LIACF American Lithium $1.415 TSLA Tesla $628.84 ALB Albemarle Corporation $199.33 SQM Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile $87.57\n\nPiedmont Lithium (PLL)  Graphic of Lithium scientific symbol (Li) in the shape of a big white gear with construction equipment and mountain around it\n\nSource: GrAl / Shutterstock.com\n\nPiedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) aims to become an integrated lithium producer but might wind up being nothing more of a lithium processor.\n\nIts primary project is located in Gaston County, North Carolina, where it expects to produce roughly 30,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide from more than 200,000 tons of spodumene each year. However, Piedmont’s regulatory troubles have gotten it in hot water, which cast a shadow of uncertainty on its future.\n\nThe company doesn’t have permits for its project from either the state or the local government. Moreover, it faces strong opposition from the Gaston County Board, which is responsible for granting permission to develop the mine. Despite everything hanging in the balance, PLL stock trades at a lofty valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nCBAK Energy Technology (CBAT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for CBAK Energy Technology (CBAT)\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nCBAK Energy Technology (NASDAQ:CBAT) is an EV lithium-ion battery producer in Mainland China. The market is remarkably competitive, full of smaller competitors that continue gobbling up CBAK’s market share.\n\nMoreover, the company’s clientele market share is limited to a few customers, which account for over 50% of its sales. Hence, losing one customer will result in a huge blow to its fundamentals. Additionally, our stock has fallen out of favor with its investors, having shed over 70% of its value in the past 12 months.\n\nRecently, CBAK announced its acquisition of a troubled battery materials supplier in Hitrans Lithium Battery Technology. CBAK claims that Hirans generated roughly four times its revenues during the first nine months of last year.\n\n7 Unstoppable Stocks to Own in 2022\n\nHowever, filings have shown that the acquired company’s financials are extremely weak, with large cash deficits. Hence, with plenty of uncertainties surrounding its business, CBAK stock remains a highly risky bet in its sector.\n\nLithium Stocks: Standard Lithium (SLI) a pile of lithium. Lithium Stocks\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.com\n\nStandard Lithium (NYSEAMERICAN:SLI) develops extraction technologies that can effectively utilize bromine extraction infrastructure to produce battery-ready lithium salts.\n\nThough it’s still early days in the development of its plant, there is significant potential for creating a massive lithium source down the line.\n\nStrong evidence supports the need for Lithium due to the proliferation of EVs and battery storage. Therefore, the risk lies in its execution abilities and production process. SLI expects a whopping $1 billion in capital expenditures based on $4 billion in project returns.\n\nFeasibility information is lacking, which has led to massive uncertainty surrounding the stock. Moreover, it only has $100 million in cash at this time, which points to future dilution and debt increases.\n\nAmerican Lithium (LIACF) lithium (LI) on the periodic table. Lithium Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Lithium (OTCMKTS:LIACF) focuses on developing leading lithium projects in the Americas. It’s a penny stock that gained incredibly in 2020 from multiple catalysts.\n\nHowever, the movement in stock price wasn’t related to the company fundamentals. The company is a pre-revenue business that needs constant cash flow injections to stay afloat. Naturally, it could pay off in the long run if it hits big in the coming years. However, the chances of its success seem minimal at this time.\n\nLithium demand is expected to rise at a staggering pace over the next several years. Analysts at McKinsey report that demand for lithium could rise from an estimated 500,000 metric tons in 2021 to three to four million metric tons by 2030.\n\n7 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever\n\nHence, American Lithium and other lithium producers will continue to float up and down regardless of their competencies and quality of fundamentals.\n\nLithium Stocks: Tesla (TSLA) Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) logo displayed on a phone in front of a blurred image of Elon Musk\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an O.G. in the EV sector which has also been the most successful business in the burgeoning niche.\n\nUnlike several EV start-ups that have emerged over the past couple of years, it’s a business that continues to thrive and is delivering real cars to real people. Its fundamentals are impressive from top to bottom, and have kicked into overdrive of late.\n\nWith the rising metal prices, Elon Musk recently tweeted about Tesla getting into the lithium mining and refining business. Musk said that though there is no shortage of lithium, the pace of refinement is slow. Moreover, the “Price of lithium has gone to insane levels.” It remains to be seen how successful the business might turn out to be in terms of improving supply and limiting costs.\n\nNevertheless, TSLA stock’s meteoric price remains a bone of contention, with it trading over 50 times enterprise value to EBITDA.\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) is a leading lithium conglomerate business that has been one of the most consistent performers in its niche. Its operations are highly diversified from a geographic standpoint, which gives it the edge over its competition.\n\nMoreover, the variety of locations it operates in gives it a unique advantage in dealing with different governments.  The stability of its business is linked to the stability of its mines, which has plenty to do ALB’s relationship with various governments.  Nevertheless, it has established itself as a juggernaut in the sector, and it’s in the best position to capitalize on the demand for lithium.\n\n7 Great Dividend Stocks Under $25\n\nThere are, however, plenty of risks to consider with ALB stock. Firstly, it trades at a nosebleed valuation of 4.70 times forward sales estimates. Moreover, it is always at the mercy of governments and institutions, which could significantly hamper its business.\n\nLithium Stocks: Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM) Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's web page on it.

Its nutrients and minerals are in use for various applications, including batteries and lithium derivatives. Moreover, it’s been a top performer in the sector, growing sales and EBITDA by over 100% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThough there’s plenty to like about SQM, Chilean lithium faces immense political risks. Social Convergence, a left-leaning party, recently won the elections in Chile, and the parliament subsequently voted to repeal the current constitution.\n\nSQM enjoyed a privileged position under the old constitution. The consensus is that the new Chilean government will be looking to nationalize the production of copper and lithium. If that’s the case, then SQM and its stockholders could be in a world of trouble.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\n$200 Oil Sooner Than You Think – Buy This Now Stock Prodigy Who Found NIO at $2… Says Buy THIS Early Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air” It doesn’t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

"2022-05-31T11:00:00+00:00","Effective Growth Strategy To Counter Raw Material Price Hikes Challenges With Supply Chain Integration Supported By Strong Market Demands &amp; Increased Production Capacity","NEW YORK, May 31, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- On May 19, 2022, CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: CBAT), a leading China-based lithium-ion battery manufacturer and electric energy solution provider released its first quarter earnings ended March 31, 2022.\n\nMomentous Revenue Growth\n\nCBAT kicked off 2022 with net revenues in 1Q-2022 surging more than eight-fold year-over-year to reach $80.2 million; of which, $65 million was from lithium battery cells materials business acquired from Hitran's merger completed in 4Q-2022. Nevertheless, demand for CBAT's high power lithium batteries has continued to prove robust.\n\nSales of the Company's high-power lithium-ion batteries increased ~70% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2022, especially driven by the Light Electric Vehicle end-product application, as well as by the continued momentum in its Uninterruptible Supplies products, achieved even when CBAT was still ramping up production capacity at its Nanjing battery manufacturing facility.\n\nCBAK Energy's production facilities, both in Dalian and Nanjing, currently have a total battery production capacity of 2GWh, and its Nanjing facility is ramping towards a maximum capacity of 18GWh. Based on the strong lithium batteries sales registered in 1Q-2022, CBAT has tremendous potential to multiply its battery sales once the facility has reached its maximum production capacity, supported by strong market demand from the EV and LEV battery ecosystem.\n\nStrong Order Backlog with More Larger Orders Expected in The Near Term\n\nOwing to the positive market feedback on the Company's products, CBAT has an order backlog of approximately $69 million as of May 9, 2022, including the order for lithium-ion batteries supply worth of ~$29.3 million from a leading European provider of heating, cooling and renewable energy systems company, to be met by the full capacity at its main factory in Dalian, together with increased production at its Nanjing plant.\n\nCBAT also expects to receive more orders in the coming quarters, and some in bigger orders starting in the 3rd quarter of 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecent Product Development & 2022 Operating Focus\n\nCBAT continued to develop Large Cylindrical batteries targeting at the LEV and passenger-grade EV markets. The design and R&D for model 42140 battery were completed, and its model prototype production is being worked on catered to the robust market demand.\n\nThe Company's main focus in the second quarter is to maintain stable revenues from its uninterruptible supplies and raw material businesses, and will also continue to expand its large-cylindrical batteries through signing new contracts with the LEV and EV manufacturer customers.\n\nParticularly benefiting from the rapidly rising global commodity prices, the new raw material business resulting from Hitran's acquisition has now accounted for a major stream of the Company's total revenues. With reliable product quality, Hitran is able to develop and accumulate a number of strategic customers, and is now in full production and expected to further make high nickel, cathode materials used for EV safety and driving range improvement.\n\n3-Step Strategic Plan to Counter Material Price Hikes and Improve Margins\n\nIn order to combat the impact of rising raw material costs which decreased the profitability of its downstream battery production, CBAT management is proactively taking measures in three main aspects:\n\nStep 1. Sign long-term supply agreements with major suppliers to secure major materials supplies.\n\nStep 2. Expand into the upstream raw material business and use material price inflation to offset the decrease in gross margins of battery plants.\n\nStep 3. Renegotiate prices with downstream customers to successfully raise product prices for the Company's key customers.\n\nManagement expects the gross margin to improve once its raw-material production capacity and downstream price increases are implemented through the 3-step strategic plan, and subsequently becomes a leading lithium-ion battery and electric energy solutions provider, with secured raw materials and augmented downstream battery production capacity, despite the short-term pressure on the Company's cash flow by the rising material prices.\n\nThe Company also plans to actively search for quality assets for value-add acquisitions, aiming at stabilized supply chain and enhanced investment returns.\n\nFirst Quarter 2022 Financial Highlights\n\nNet revenues were $80.2 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 752%, and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 188%. The increases were mainly driven by incremental revenues from integrating lithium battery materials business post Hitran acquisition, as well as by ~70% year-over-year growth in high power lithium batteries sales.\n\nAdditionally in terms of net revenues by end-product applications, revenues from high power lithium batteries used in LEV grew 329% YoY in the quarter.\n\n1Q-2022 gross profit margin was 6.6%, down from 19.5% in 1Q-2021 while up from 3.7% in 4Q-2021, primarily due to the increase in raw material costs, which are expected to abate when new capacity is being added by the overall industry.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased 256% YoY, primarily due to growing headcount and consolidation of Hitran; among which, R&D expense in particular increased 585% YoY, coupled with 290% YoY increase in Sales & Marketing expenses. Despite the increases, operating expenses was limited to 8.3% of revenues in the quarter, down significantly from 19.8% from a year ago.\n\nNet income attributable to CBAT shareholders was $0.4 million, compared to $29.6 million in 1Q-2021 when the fair value of its warrant's liability decreased significantly due to lower stock prices, which in turn led to higher GAAP earnings. Change in CBAT warrant's fair value was merely $1.6 million in 1Q-2022, compared to $28.4 million in the same period of 2021. Basic and fully-diluted net income per share were both $0.01 in the quarter, compared to a net income per share of $0.35 in 1Q-2021.\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $5.6 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $7.4 million as of December 31, 2021.\n\nDISCLOSURES AND DISCLAIMERS\n\nStone Street Group LLC (""Stone Street"") publishes research reports on publicly-traded companies.

If you want to skip reading about how and why lithium prices are skyrocketing, you can go directly to 5 Best Lithium Stock To Buy Now.\n\nLithium prices are rallying during the EV boom. As concerns about climate change and global warming alarm governments to take action, and the global economy transitions to electrified transport and abandons combustion engines, the demand for lithium is bound to skyrocket. The biggest industrial application of lithium as of now is its use in powertrains of electric vehicles. Every big player in the automobile manufacturing industry has announced its plans to go all-electric at some point in the future, with some targeting achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2035, and others planning all-electric fleets by 2050. Lithium manufacturers and miners are looking at lucrative days ahead, as the demand for lithium grows catalyzed by global EV adoption.\n\nGlobal EV Adoption\n\nAccording to Statista, even though a semiconductor shortage resulted in a rough year for the automobile industry in 2021, global electric vehicle sales saw a two-fold increase compared to 2020, peaking at 6.6 million up from 3 million. According to the EV volumes data, cited by the International Energy Agency, all net growth in global car sales in 2021 can be attributed to EVs. China was leading in 2021 having almost tripled electric car sales from 1.2 to 3.4 million. Europe was the runner-up region that reported new car registrations up by 70% from 2020, hitting 2.3 million, roughly half of which had electric powertrains. For the first time in history, new car sales crossed 1 million in the United States, and more than half of which were electric cars.\n\nStrong Demand For Lithium Ahead\n\nAccording to S&P Global Commodity Insights, the demand for lithium is expected to further strengthen in 2022. S&P Global Platts data shows that seaborne lithium carbonate prices went up by 413% in 2021 and hit $32,600 per metric ton last December. Lithium hydroxide prices gained 254% over the same period to reach $31,900 per metric ton. Lithium chemical supply is expected to hit 636,000 metric tons, up from roughly 497,000 metric tons in 2021. The demand for lithium is forecasted to grow to 641,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2022, up from 504,000 metric tons in 2021. This creates a deficit of 5,000 metric tons, down from a deficit of 8,000 metric tons in 2021, and according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, this deficit is expected to drive lithium prices to record highs in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoaring lithium prices have resulted in EV manufacturers pondering about creating their own lithium power plants. This April, a tweet highlighted the exponential growth of the price of lithium from $4,450 per tonne in 2012 to $78,032 per tonne as of April 2022. Shortly after, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), was reported to be talking about exploring opportunities for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to get into mining and refining lithium on its own unless prices for the commodity relax.\n\nProminent names in the lithium industry include Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS), and Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo determine the 10 best lithium stocks to buy now we looked for companies that are continually making progress with expansions of their facilities and are racing to become the go-to suppliers for major EV companies.

"2022-04-21T15:20:00+00:00","CBAT - 2021 Marked A Year of Turnaround, Backed By Strong Market Demands, Increasing Production Capacity &amp; Integrated Supply of Lithium-Battery Materials","NEW YORK, April 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- CBAK Energy (Nasdaq: CBAT) released its fourth quarter and full year earnings ended Dec. 31, 2021 on April 14, 2022.\n\n2021 marked a major year for CBAK Energy as the Company gained significant traction across its product lines, powered by strengthened technology and product competitiveness, and amplified by further expanded production capacity catered to increasing battery demands for light electric vehicles (""LEV"") and electric vehicles (""EV"").\n\nAccording to press release, CBAT turned profitable in 2021 on GAAP basis, with revenues growing 80% and 40% year-over-year to $27.8 million and $52.7 million in the fourth quarter and the full year, respectively. Sales of high power lithium batteries grew 92% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2021. Among which, revenues from high power lithium batteries used in LEV increased 3631% and 1779% year-over-year in 4Q-2021 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe demonstrated strong financial and operational performance was also attributed to the stable supply of lithium-ion batteries raw materials, secured by CBAT's acquisition of majority stake in Zhejiang Hitrans Lithium Battery Technology Co. in November 2021, allowing the Company to build out its battery product ecosystem and scale the business. Having stable raw materials supply is especially crucial in an environment of rising commodity prices.\n\nWith the growth momentum in LEVs and EVs expected to remain strong in the foreseeable future, the Company has been mindful of the rising battery demands, and will continue to focus on scaling its battery production capacity, as well as expanding its battery material business to drive growth and cement its industry position as a frontrunner and leader in lithium-ion battery production and electric energy solutions.

For the full year of 2021, net revenues increased 40% YoY to $52.7 million from $37.6 million in 2020.\n\nIn terms of net revenues by end-product applications, revenues from high power lithium batteries used in LEV were $485,000 and $733,000, representing a YoY increase of 3631% and 1779% in 4Q-2021 and 2021, respectively.\n\nGross margin down from 6.8% 4Q-2020 to 3.7% in 4Q-2021, primarily due to the increase in raw material costs; while for the full year of 2021, gross margin expanded to 9.7%, an increase of 250 bps from 2020, mainly driven by the increased quality passing rate of products resulting from the Company's product quality control.\n\nNet income attributable to CBAT shareholders increased to $9.2 million in 4Q-2021, compared to a net loss of $4.3 million in 4Q-2020. For the full year of 2021, GAAP net income was $61.5 million, compared to a net loss of $7.8 million in 2020, primarily driven by change in fair value of warrants liabilities from lower CBAT stock share prices.\n\nBasic and fully-diluted net income per share were both $0.1 in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to a net loss per share of $0.07 in 4Q-2020.

We continued to strengthen our competitive advantages through innovative technology and product developments. We also expanded our production capacity as scheduled to address increasing battery demands for light electric vehicles (""LEV"") and electric vehicles (""EV""). Moreover, we brought in materials for lithium-ion batteries with an acquisition of a majority stake in Zhejiang Hitrans Lithium Battery Technology Co. to build out and enhance our battery product ecosystem as we seek stable raw material supply and drive greater revenue for our business.""\n\nStory continues\n\nMr. Li continued: ""As 2022 evolves, LEVs and EVs will maintain their strong growth momentum and we will continue to focus on scaling up capacity and expanding our battery material business. Looking forward, we believe these growth drivers and strategies will cement our competitive strengths and empower us to become a frontrunner and leader in lithium-ion battery production and electric energy solutions.""\n\nXiangyu Pei, Interim Chief Financial Officer of the Company, noted: ""We continued to expand revenue and gross margin levels that are driven by stronger sales of high power lithium batteries as well as the addition of the material business brought by the acquisition of Hitrans. Notably, our revenues grew 40% year-over-year to $52.7 million in 2021 while gross margin increased by 250 basis points to 9.7%. We also turned to profitability in 2021 with net income of $61.5 million attributable to shareholders of CBAK Energy, from a loss of $7.8 million in the previous year. Importantly, we continued to invest in new headcounts, new business as well as research and development to drive further growth. We believe these investments, combined with our sound financial position and powerful battery product ecosystem, will enable us to sustain long-term, profitable growth.""\n\nFourth Quarter 2021 Business Highlights & Recent Developments\n\nIn March 2022, the Company announced that revenues of Zhejiang Hitrans Lithium Battery Technology Co. (""Hitrans""), a leading lithium-ion battery material supplier in China, reached almost $100 million in the first nine months of 2021 before the acquisition of its majority stake closed, four times CBAK Energy's revenues in the same period. In December 2021, CBAK Energy announced an agreement with AZAPA R&D China (""AZAPA"") to develop a customized battery pack for the Sino-Japan joint venture that designs and produces electronic and battery control systems for electric vehicles. In November 2021, Dalian CBAK Power Battery Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBAK Energy, completed its previously announced acquisition of 81.56% equity interests in Hitrans. In November 2021, CBAK Energy announced it has begun operations at its lithium battery manufacturing plant in the city of Nanjing in China'sJiangsu province with an initial capacity of 0.7 GWh. The Company has also started operating a new production line at its Dalian facility with a capacity of 0.4 GWh.\n\nFourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results\n\nNet revenues were $27.8 million, an increase of 80% from $15.4 million in the same period of 2020. This was driven mostly by strong sales of high power lithium batteries, and additional revenues from lithium battery materials brought by the acquisition of Hitrans from Nov. 26, 2021 to Dec. 31, 2021.\n\nNet Revenues by End-product Applications\r\n($ thousands) 2021\n\nFourth\n\nQuarter 2020\r\nFourth\n\nQuarter % \r\nChange\r\nYoY Segment 1\n\nHigh power lithium batteries used in: Uninterruptable supplies $9,308 $5,641 65 Light electric vehicles 485 13 3631 Electric vehicles 142 -483 -129 Segment 2 (Hitrans)\n\nMaterials for use in manufacturing of lithium battery \r\ncell\n\nPrecursor\n\nNiCoMn 9,139\n\n8,726 -\n\n- -\n\n- Trading of raw materials used in lithium batteries 2 10,249 -100 Total  $27,802 $15,420 80\n\nCost of revenues was $26.8 million, an increase of 86% from $14.4 million in the same period of 2020. This was primarily due to increased net revenues.\n\nGross profit was $1.0 million, similar to that in the same period of 2020. Gross margin was 3.7%, compared to 6.8% in the same period of 2020. The change in gross margin was primarily due to the increase in raw material costs\n\nTotal operating expenses were $6.8 million, a decrease of 3% from $7.0 million in the same period of 2020, as we recovered certain doubtful accounts and there's no impairment charge on property, plant, and equipment, which offsets the impact from increased expenses related to research and development, sales and marketing, and general administration.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $1.9 million, an increase of 252% from $0.5 million in the same period of 2020. Sales and marketing expenses were $1.0 million, an increase of 197% from $0.3 million in the same period of 2020.

Most of the increase in all expense categories was due to growing headcount and the acquisition of Hitrans.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $5.3 million, an increase of 214% from $1.7 million in 2020. The increase was mainly due to the increase in salaries, and the acquisition of Hitrans. Sales and marketing expenses were $2.3 million, an increase of 228% from $0.7 million in 2020. The increase was mainly due to the increase in salaries, the acquisition of Hitrans, and expanded sales and marketing efforts. General and administrative expenses were $10.0 million, an increase of 168% from $3.7 million in 2020. The increase was mainly due to Nasdaq listing expenses, the increase in salaries resulting from the Hitrans' acquisition and the new facility in Nanjing as well as the increase in consultancy fees. Recovery of doubtful accounts was $0.8 million, compared to provision for doubtful accounts of $0.7 million in 2020.\n\nOperating loss was $11.7 million, compared to $8.5 million in 2020.\n\nFinance income, net was $0.8 million, compared to finance expenses of $1.4 million in 2020, representing an improvement of $2.2 million as a result of lower loan balances in 2021 and interest income generated from security deposit to finance for the issuance of bills payable.\n\nChange in fair value of warrants was $61.8 million, compared to $2.1 million in 2020.

(NASDAQ: CBAT) (""CBAK Energy,"" or the ""Company""), a leading lithium-ion battery manufacturer and electric energy solution provider in China, today announced financial highlights of Zhejiang Hitrans Lithium Battery Technology Co. (""Hitrans""), a leading lithium-ion battery material supplier in China that CBAK Energy has completed an acquisition of 81.56% of its equity stake, for the first nine months of 2021.\n\nHitrans's revenues were $97.9 million in the first three quarters of 2021, roughly four times CBAK Energy's revenues in the same period. Hitrans generated a gross profit of $11.0 million, about 2.7 times the gross profit of CBAK Energy in the same period. Its operating profit was $4.2 million. More detailed financial data of Hitrans can be accessed on the 8K filing filed by the Company to the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 17, 2022.\n\nFirst Nine Months of 2021 ($) Hitrans Revenues 97,875,308 Gross Profit 10,963,386 Operating Profit (Loss） 4,229,511\n\nConsidering the transaction was closed on November 29, 2021, Hitrans's financial performance before the closing date will not be incorporated into CBAK Energy's financial results for the 2021 fiscal year. Hitrans's results for the first nine months of 2021 are provided for a better understanding of its financial performance, and its excellent results are expected to significantly increase CBAK Energy's financial results in 2022 and beyond.\n\nAfter the acquisition, CBAK Energy just replaced some financial and administration personnel of Hitrans while other team members, including technical and sales personnel, remained the same to continue their support for the business growth of the unit. Hitrans mainly focuses on the production and sales of NCM precursors and cathode materials for lithium batteries. Building upon its superior performance and cutting-edge technologies, Hitrans has become one of small and medium-sized enterprises that dominate major markets in niche sectors with increased financial and tax support and enhanced credit policies from the government, which allows such companies to further innovate and grow into ""little giants."" Such a small and medium-sized enterprise with a considerable amount of government support is therefore a factor that numerous Chinese investors will evaluate when selecting investment targets of great potential growth.

"2021-12-28T10:18:25+00:00","Is CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBAT) Popular Amongst Insiders?","The big shareholder groups in CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBAT) have power over the company. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. Warren Buffett said that he likes ""a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people."" So it's nice to see some insider ownership, because it may suggest that management is owner-oriented.\n\nCBAK Energy Technology is a smaller company with a market capitalization of US$148m, so it may still be flying under the radar of many institutional investors. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about CBAK Energy Technology.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for CBAK Energy Technology  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About CBAK Energy Technology?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in CBAK Energy Technology. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see CBAK Energy Technology's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nStory continues earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in CBAK Energy Technology. The company's CEO Yunfei Li is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.8% and 9.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. We're not picking up on any analyst coverage of the stock at the moment, so the company is unlikely to be widely held.\n\nInsider Ownership Of CBAK Energy Technology\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of CBAK Energy Technology, Inc.. Insiders own US$44m worth of shares in the US$148m company. We would say this shows alignment with shareholders, but it is worth noting that the company is still quite small; some insiders may have founded the business. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a substantial 54% stake in CBAK Energy Technology, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability.\n\nPrivate Company Ownership\n\nWe can see that Private Companies own 9.5%, of the shares on issue. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand CBAK Energy Technology better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for CBAK Energy Technology (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nOf course this may not be the best stock to buy.

Overall, CBAT management envisions the Company's total annual production capacity to grow to 30 GWh in 2025 respectively to tackle the growing market size.\n\nClear growth roadmap with diverse product rollout and industry applications. The launch of special 26650 batteries built for ultra-low temperature and the rollout of upgraded model 26700 batteries, coupled with production capacity expansion in model 32140 and 46800 batteries to be complemented by Solid-State batteries, are collectively positioning CBAT as the top cylindrical Lithium-ion battery producer to capitalize the growing market demand from across energy storage, light-electric-vehicle and electric-vehicle markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrong partnerships and solid client base. The consistent high product quality has enabled CBAT to form strong strategic partnership and build a solid client base globally, including strategic partnerships with VIESSMANN as its sole supplier in China, and with Schneider and Haier as the first step into the energy storage sector.\n\nSynergistic vertical acquisition secured stable raw material supply and incremental revenues. CBAT completed its acquisition of 81.56% of equity interests in Zhejiang Hitrans Lithium Battery Technology Co., a critical supply chain partner to CBAT and a developer/producer of ternary precursor and cathode materials. With Hitrans' annual production capacity of 12,000 tons of NCM precursors and 8,000 tons of cathode materials, both expected to expand to 50,000 tons by 2023, this acquisition will add raw materials, operational services and material recycling capabilities to CBAT's existing production processes, and support the Company's production capacity expansion with reliable raw materials supply, meanwhile expanding its topline revenues to include raw materials sales starting as early as December 2021, and further strengthening CBAT's strategic position within the high-power lithium battery market and new-energy vehicle ecosystem.\n\nHigh product quality with great consistency. CBAT applies superb quality control systems, and is certified by ISO9001, OHSAS18001, ISO TS16949, ISO14000 and China Quality Certification Centre. CBAT has built a track record where the average return-rate of goods delivered in 2020 was significantly below a threshold of 0.03%, the average monthly defect rate of key products delivered in 2020 was approximately 4.5%, below the goal of lower than 7%, and no safety incidents reported by its major clients for battery supply to EV projects. Such consistency of high product quality has enabled CBAT to build a solid client base, including SIEMENS, Haier, VIESSMANN, Dongfeng Motor, LEVDEO, Han Tang Electric Vehicle, and many others.\n\nTechnical advanced special battery launch built for ultra-low temperature. CBAT has launched its special 26650 lithium-ion battery, specifically designed for the ultra-low temperature environment ranging from -40 to -50°C, while the regular lithium-ion batteries cannot be recharged below 0℃, nor can the power be properly discharged below -20℃. With the launch of this special battery, CBAT can showcase its leading technical advantage in the global markets. This special 26650 battery is ideal for base station, unmanned aerial vehicle, aerospace vehicle and even military usage. CBAT's customers have been testing the samples, and the management is seeing growing demand for this special battery from China's Northern region, as well as from the aviation and aerospace industries.\n\nDemonstrated high efficiency and price-to-performance ratio. CBAT's cylindrical lithium iron phosphate batteries have distinct advantages over prismatic batteries and ternary lithium batteries. Relative to prismatic cells batteries, cylindrical batteries are safety, easier to radiate heat and control temperatures, and enjoy higher production automation leading to 10-20% lower production costs; while compared to ternary lithium batteries, lithium iron phosphate batteries have higher temperature resistance, greater safety and stability, lower production price and better cycle performance.\n\nProven product innovation driven by strong R&D. CBAT invests in R&D, materials, production equipment and processes targeting to improve product safety and quality. The Company entered a three-year strategic agreement in January 2021 with JAC Motors, a top PRC vehicle manufacturer, to jointly develop certain cylindrical lithium-ion batteries catered to the auto industry, including model 46800 batteries, and entered partnership with Changxing Sino-Russian New Energy and Material Technology Research Institute (NEMTRI) to co-develop solid-state batteries. Built on the mature technology of 32140 large cylindrical batteries, CBAT already started the R&D of 46800 batteries in the 2nd half of 2021.\n\nBusiness Overview\r\nCBAK Energy Technology, Inc., formerly China BAK Battery, Inc., together with its subsidiaries are engaged in the manufacture, commercialization and distribution of a range of standard and customized lithium ion (Li-ion) rechargeable batteries, for the use in an array of applications across LEV (light electric vehicles such as electric bicycles, electric motors and sight-seeing cars,) EV (e.g. electric cars, electric buses, hybrid electric cars and buses), energy storage, uninterruptible power supply, electric tools and other high power quality control applications.\n\nProducts & Solutions\r\n26650 Battery is CBAT's matured model with reliable performance Ideal for energy storage solution, currently the key cash flow generator for CBAT. With continued innovations, 26650 batteries specially designed for the ultra-low temperature environment has paved the way for CBAT's geographic expansion.\n\n32140 Battery offers great solutions for the Light Electric Vehicles market, featuring 4X the capacity of regular batteries (Model 26650) and 20% lower in cost. 32140 Production line has completed, ready to partner with Chinese OEMs for new products.\n\n46800 battery is the next-gen model targeting the Passenger EV market, able to power faster acceleration, reduce battery loss and prolong driving range at lower cost. This model is currently under testing, with production expected to start in 2023.\n\nProduct Comparisons\r\nModel 26650 - The 26650 battery is developed on the basis of the 18650 battery, where ""26"" and ""18"" refer to the outer diameter of the battery. The 26650 battery has an electric charge capacity of 4-6Ah (depending on the type of chemical systems) and power energy of 10-20Wh, and given its small size and flexibility for battery-pack assembly, is particularly suitable for household solar battery energy storage devices (required 4-10KW) and domestic electric bicycle market (48-60V 10-20Ah), while not suitable for EV as it demands much higher energy power (usually 40-100KWh) which is better met with the Prismatic batteries (185-740Wh). If 26650 batteries were to be used for the EV, it would require a battery-pack comprised of many more single batteries and corresponding structural parts that that of the Prismatic batteries. Meanwhile the BMS (Battery Management System) involving more components would also increase accordingly, resulting in higher costs.\n\nThe Energy Storage market is mainly divided into three types: home, power station and base station energy storage. Although CBAT's 26650 battery is mainly used for household energy storage, the specially designed ultra-low temperature 26650 battery can operate efficiently in low temperature environments, work normally at a temperature of -40°C to -50°C, and can discharge at a rate of 60C at room temperature, and hence can be used in base stations, unmanned aerial vehicles, aerospace, and military industries in ultra-low temperature environments, making CBAT's strong technical advantages and manufacturing capabilities of ultra-low temperature batteries extremely competitive as the market's demand for ultra-low temperature batteries increases.\n\nModel 32140 – The battery volume of a single 32140 battery is 3.2 times, while the power energy is 4 times that of a single 26650 battery, meaning that the energy density is increased. Compared to 26650 model, 32140 battery has better heat dissipation and a lower manufacturing cost (less structural parts and less complicated BMS than a battery-pack using 26650 batteries), more suitable for low-speed electric vehicles which typically require a battery with electric charge of 72V 100-120Ah.\n\nModel 46800 - Compared with the 26650, the large cylindrical 46800 battery has higher energy density and lower battery-packing cost. It adopts CTC technology (Cell to Chassis) in integrating the battery directly into the chassis, with reduced number of battery cells and corresponding structural parts needed in the whole battery-pack to create higher energy density, simply the BMS and lower the overall packing cost.\n\nGiven that the height of the EV chassis is generally below 100mm, and the height of the 46800 battery is 80mm, the battery can be placed vertically on the EV chassis, which is the most suitable battery size for CTC technology. On the other hand, as the 32140 battery has a height of 140mm, it can only be placed flat on the EV chassis, where not only the packing design is complicated, the energy density is lower, and the cost is consequently higher.\n\nCylindrical 46800 vs. Prismatic Battery – Under the same type of chemical system, the energy density of Cylindrical 46800 batteries is 3-10% higher than that of Prismatic batteries. It is easier to automate the production and assembly of the battery-pack using 46800 batteries with higher consistency and longer service-life than using Prismatic batteries. And in terms of cost, since the degree of automation is high, the production cost is 10-20% lower than that of the Prismatic battery. The steel shell used in the 46800 is far stronger than the aluminum shell of the prismatic battery, 46800 batteries are also safer than the Prismatic batteries, by avoiding the leakage caused by the rupture of the aluminum shell and other potential problems.\n\n46800 model adopts the CID safety design, where the circuit can be disconnected by itself under conditions such as external short circuit, while the Prismatic battery has no such safety design embedded. By using CTC technology in battery-packing process, the energy density of the whole pack can reach or even exceed that of the battery-pact using the Prismatic batteries.\n\nTwo Production Facilities\n\nDalian Facility - Focused on energy storage solutions:\n\nBuilt in 2013 and covers 154,000 square meters, this facility primarily focuses on manufacturing CBAT's mode 26650 batteries catered to the energy storage sector.\n\nAs of Q3 2021, the facility has a production capacity of 1GWh, and gradually grow to 10GWh by 2025.\n\nA new production line with an initial annual capacity of 0.4GWh for its new 26700 battery model was added and started operation in Q3-2021.\n\nNanjing Facility – Focused on the EV/LEV markets\n\nPhase 1 - Subsidized by the Nanjing government, this facility covers 10,000 square meters and is on track to complete construction by the end of 2022 to reach a total annual production output capacity of 2 GWh. Production line and manufacturing equipment with an initial annual capacity of 0.7GW were already installed and tested, and had started the commercial production and deliveries of 32140 batteries in Q4-2021, while simultaneously ramping up the output to its full capacity by adding additional 1.3 GWh in 2022.\n\nPhase 2 – This phase of construction will cover an area of 73,000 square meters, with design work completed and expected to commence construction by the end of 2021. CBAT originally planned for an annual capacity of 6 GWh, which was raised to 18 GWh for a mixture of 32140 and 46800 batteries production to accommodate growing demands, according to the Company's press release on November 19.\n\nLithium Battery and EV market Growth Projections\n\nThe global and China market size for Li-ion Batteries used in Energy Storage is expected to grow at a respective CAGR of 45% and 53% from 2020 to 2025.\n\nSales volume of new energy vehicles from outside-of-China and China is expected to grow at a respective CAGR of 41% and 35% from 2020 to 2025.\n\nCompared with the traditional batteries, lithium batteries have the characteristics of complete charge and discharge, high capacity, energy saving and environmental protection, light weight, and no memory effect.\n\nCurrently, the lithium battery industry has three major markets:\n\nDigital products, such as computers, mobile phones, earphones, and electronic watches. Energy Storage, such as household energy storage, energy storage power stations, etc. Electric vehicles, such as electric cars and electric power stations, bicycles, electric trucks.\n\nEnergy Storage customers have put forward stringent requirements on battery life and capacity, demanding the battery capacity of no less than 80% of the normal capacity after a service life of 10 years or following 8000 cycles. In 2016, customers demanded even higher requirements for battery capacity. For example, in 2016, customers demanded 3Ah for 26650, but this year, customers demanded 4Ah, but battery life is still the above-mentioned requirement.\n\nElectric bicycle customers, electric vehicle customers, and low-speed electric vehicle customers also pay attention to battery temperature, and generally require that the 1C rate discharge battery pack's temperature does not rise above 60°C.\n\nBesides battery energy density and costs, battery customers also pay attention to how the battery's discharge capacity performs under different temperatures, and how fast the capacity decay during the storage.\n\nCylindrical versus Prismatic Batteries\n\nThe degree of automation for cylindrical batteries is high, and the production cost is 10-20% lower than that of prismatic batteries. The cylindrical steel shell is far more resistant to deformation than the aluminum shell of the prismatic battery, avoiding liquid leakage and squeezed wiring harness leakage caused by the rupture of the prismatic shell during use. Additionally, as the CID safety design is adopted in cylindrical battery production, the battery can be disconnected by itself under conditions such as external short circuit, whereas the prismatic battery has no relevant safety design. Under safety failure conditions, such as a single battery exploding for some reason, a cylindrical battery does not necessarily cause the entire pack of batteries to explode, and even it does, it would take a long while for a single explosion to cause the entire pack to explode or burn, allowing the driver to escape, versus the case in prismatic-battery pack, the single explosion could cause explosion or burning of the whole pack quickly, given prismatic battery's larger energy (185Wh-740Wh). Prismatic battery also does not perform well under the low-temperature environment.\n\nOn the flip side, cylindrical batteries are disadvantaged compared to prismatic batteries. Due to the low capacity of cylindrical batteries, more batteries and structural parts are required for the battery pack, compared to the prismatic batteries. At the same time, the battery management system BMS will have more complex algorithms owing to the increased number of batteries needed.\n\nIn addition, as China domestic BMS algorithm is still below the level of Tesla, the battery life of cylindrical battery-pack is shorter than that of prismatic battery pack, despite that cylindrical battery has higher consistency. Meanwhile, due to the low energy density of the small cylindrical battery cells and the low utilization rate of the pack space, the energy density of the cylindrical battery pack is lower.\n\nThe use of prismatic batteries has become the mainstream in China, as the national subsidy policy is mainly based on the energy density of the battery pack. Nevertheless, with the advancement of material technology, large cylindrical battery technology and packing technology, the energy density of large cylindrical batteries has now reached or even surpassed that of prismatic batteries, and is expected to gain more adoption and traction in China and globally.\n\nTesla have been in favor of cylindrical batteries in recent years. Cylindrical batteries have achieved a large number of applications and developments, from 18650 at the beginning, to 21700 three years ago, and to 46,800 in the next few years. Similar to the development of prismatic batteries, cylindrical batteries development is also gradually towards larger sizes.\n\nCompetitors\n\nCurrently, Guoxuan Hi-Tech and Anchi Technology are two main 32140 batteries producers in China.\n\nAs to 46800, many domestic companies have deployed a plan to produce 46800 batteries; however only BAK Battery (BAK) has officially released the battery cell so far. BAK plans to build a new large cylindrical battery production line at its Zhengzhou plant, with mass production expected to achieve in the second half of 2022, and reach the planned maximum battery production capacity of 15 GWh each year.\n\nYiwei Lithium Energy stated that it has completed the strategic layout of large cylindrical batteries and will gradually promote large cylindrical batteries in 2023. Yiwei Lithium Energy plans to deploy two large cylindrical batteries, namely 46800 and 46950, expected to release a production capacity of 20 GWh in 2023, and reach 40 GWh in 2024.\n\nThird Quarter 2021 Financial Highlights\n\nStrong high power lithium batteries sales year-over-year growth. Absence of any opportunistic raw material trading gain, Q3-2021 revenue of approximately $9.6 million was almost entirely from the sales of high power lithium batteries (uninterruptable power supplies), representing a 51% year-over-year growth from high power battery sales in 2020. The notable year-over-year revenue growth is a testament to the strong demand for the Company's high-performance products, enabling CBAT to charge higher selling prices to pass on higher production costs.\n\nSlightly lower gross margin due to price inflation in raw materials. Gross profit was $1.1 million, a decrease of 17% from $1.4 million in the same period of 2020. Nevertheless, efforts made to lock in certain raw materials supply previously has helped avoid a bigger blow from commodity price hikes in the quarter, and gross margin only declined by 1% to ~12% from the same period of 2020, mainly due to the increase in raw materials prices from inflation.\n\nOperating expenses increased 339% year-over-year due to R&D and headcount investment geared for Nanjing facility expansion. CBAT registered an operating loss of $3.2 million, compared to operating profit of $0.4 million in the same period of 2020, mainly due to growing headcount and R&D expenses (up 307% Year-over-year) associated with the Company's Nanjing production facility, as well as the expiration of government's COVID-19 relief policy.\n\nNet Income benefited from change in the fair value of outstanding warrants, where market price was lower than the exercise price, leading to reduced warrant expenses. GAAP net income increased to $20.0 million in the quarter, or $0.23 per ADS from $41,715 in the same period of 2020. The huge jump was attributable to the change in fair value of warrants of $23 million in the 3rd quarter.\n\nCash and cash equivalents were US$2 million as of September 30, 2021, down from $33.3 million as of June 30, 2021, mainly due to higher R&D spending of ~$2 million and Hitrans acquisition cash payment (deposit of ~$8 million and loans to Hitrans of ~$20 million as part of acquisition price.)\n\nProduction expansion as planned. Targeting to augment the Company's ability to supply and address growing and diversified batteries demands, CBAT's production capacity expansion went ahead as scheduled, despite the global energy shortage and commodity price hikes, meanwhile making important progress in R&D to further extend its product portfolio.\n\nIn the third quarter, CBAT added and started operating a new production line with an annual capacity of 0.4GWh of its new 26700 battery model, an upgrade of the original product 26650 batteries at Dalian facility. Compared to model 26650, 26700 battery has a bigger unit capacity while at a significantly lower cost, particularly suitable for the light-electric-vehicles. With the completion of a shakedown test for model 26700 batteries, CBAT is seeing positive responses from two-wheel light electric vehicle producers and energy storage sectors. Output from this new production line was ramped up in November, and the production in Dalian facility was supposed to last until Q2-2022 fulfilling the orders already received. However due to the new contamination measures adopted by the city Dalian due to Covid-19 variant, operation of this new line, along with its existing production lines in Dalian have been suspended for the time being.\n\nProduction capacity expansion in model 32140 and 46800 batteries was also being executed as planned. Together with the launch of special 26650 batteries built for ultra-low temperature and the upgraded model 26700 batteries are strategically positioning CBAT as the top Lithium-ion battery producer to capitalize on emerging opportunities in a broader market across energy storage and EV/LEV applications.\n\nSpecial ultra-low temperature batteries secured certification. Dalian CBAK Power Battery is the world's first company to receive certification for the ultra-low temperature battery. In August 2021, CBAT secured the performance certification from the world's leading testing, inspection and certification company SGS for its special 26650 lithium-ion battery specifically designed for use in ultra-low temperatures, paving the road for the Company to expand into different markets and new applications. This model is already completed testing, ready for commercial production.\n\nAcquired battery raw material supplier Hitrans Lithium Battery Technology Co. Following the closing of previously announced acquisition on November 29, 2021 upon completing asset transfer, CBAT now owns 81.56% equity stake in Zhejiang Meidu Hitrans, which has been a critical supply chain partner to the Company. With the acquisition closed, CBAT will start combining Hitrans' financials statements as early as December, 2021, further easing supply chain challenges while adding to the Company's topline revenues. Hitrans' capabilities in scientific innovation and new technology application will enable CBAT to lead new business developments and support R&D of high-performance products, together to seize growing opportunities in the burgeoning electric vehicle industry.\n\nWith increased production capacity, management is confident that the Company is on track for solid business growth through enhanced and expanded product offerings.\n\nExperienced Management Team\n\nYunfei Li/Chairman, President & CEO\n\n20 years of management experience in real estate development, battery, and new energy industries.\n\nServed on management positions for several new energy and real estate development companies.\n\nWeneu Wang, VP & Nanjing Facility General Manager since 2018\n\nFormer CFO of CBAK from 2014 - 2019.\n\nServed as financial director of BAK Tianjin from 2013 to 2014.\n\nPreviously in charge of auditing, accounting, and consolidation of BAK India since 2010.\n\nXiujun Tian, Deputy General Manager & General Engineer\n\n15 years of experience in Li-ion battery R&D and technical management.\n\nFormer technical director of Weltmeister.\n\nPreviously in charge of the establishment of Dalian BAK and its production lines.\n\nDISCLOSURES AND DISCLAIMERS\n\nStone Street Group LLC (""Stone Street"") publishes research reports on publicly-traded companies.

Our gross margins were 18.6% in the second quarter and 19.2% in the first half year, representing significant improvements year over year driven by higher capacity utilization. We raised $70 million in February that provides good liquidity to support our production expansion and investments in new product launches. Looking ahead, we are on the right path for accelerated growth.""\n\nFirst Half 2021 Business Highlights & Recent Developments\n\nIn July, the Company announced it will acquire 81.56% of equity interests in Zhejiang Meidu Hitrans Lithium Battery Technology Co., a leading developer and manufacturer of ternary precursor and cathode materials in China. This acquisition aims to integrate a supply chain of critical raw materials to the Company's portfolio to support future expansion. In February, the Company announced production capacity expansion at the Nanjing and Dalian plants in anticipation of increasing customer orders. For the Nanjing plant Phase I project, the Company plans to invest RMB70 million to develop a production line with an annual capacity of 0.7 GWh. The plant will start operating in the second half of 2021 to produce 50,000 model 32140 batteries per day. For the Dalian plant, the Company plans to invest RMB50 million to add another production line with an annual capacity of 0.4 GWh to produce an additional 100,000 model 26650 batteries per day. In February, the Company completed a direct offering of $70 million to fund its business expansion plan, repay outstanding debt, and to fund additional working capital needs. In February, the Company announced that it developed the model 26650 battery for ultra-low temperature applications and delivered satisfactory test performance results. This new battery is designed to operate in temperatures as low as minus 40 to minus 50 degrees Celsius and can discharge at a maximum C-rate of 60C at room temperature. In January, the Company announced a cooperation agreement with Chengdu Raja New Energy Automotive Technology Co., Ltd. to jointly develop a battery swapping project for the food delivery and logistics industries as well as an uninterruptible power supply (""UPS"") project for traffic lights.\n\nSecond Quarter 2021 Financial Results\n\nNet revenues were $5.9 million, an increase of 27% from $4.6 million in the same period of 2020.

"2021-07-01T06:03:29+00:00","CBAK Energy Technology's (NASDAQ:CBAT) Wonderful 504% Share Price Increase Shows How Capitalism Can Build Wealth","CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBAT) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 11% in the last quarter. But that cannot eclipse the spectacular share price rise we've seen over the last twelve months. Indeed, the share price is up a whopping 504% in that time. So we wouldn't blame sellers for taking some profits. Of course, winners often do keep winning, so there may be more gains to come (if the business fundamentals stack up).\n\nIt really delights us to see such great share price performance for investors.\n\nView our latest analysis for CBAK Energy Technology\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring the last year CBAK Energy Technology grew its earnings per share, moving from a loss to a profit.\n\nWhen a company is just on the edge of profitability it can be well worth considering other metrics in order to more precisely gauge growth (and therefore understand share price movements).\n\nHowever the year on year revenue growth of 68% would help. Many businesses do go through a phase where they have to forgo some profits to drive business development, and sometimes its for the best.\n\nYou can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our freereport on CBAK Energy Technology's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's nice to see that CBAK Energy Technology shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 504% over the last year.

"2021-07-01T06:03:29+00:00","CBAK Energy Technology's (NASDAQ:CBAT) Wonderful 504% Share Price Increase Shows How Capitalism Can Build Wealth","CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBAT) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 11% in the last quarter. But that cannot eclipse the spectacular share price rise we've seen over the last twelve months. Indeed, the share price is up a whopping 504% in that time. So we wouldn't blame sellers for taking some profits. Of course, winners often do keep winning, so there may be more gains to come (if the business fundamentals stack up).\n\nIt really delights us to see such great share price performance for investors.\n\nView our latest analysis for CBAK Energy Technology\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring the last year CBAK Energy Technology grew its earnings per share, moving from a loss to a profit.\n\nWhen a company is just on the edge of profitability it can be well worth considering other metrics in order to more precisely gauge growth (and therefore understand share price movements).\n\nHowever the year on year revenue growth of 68% would help. Many businesses do go through a phase where they have to forgo some profits to drive business development, and sometimes its for the best.\n\nYou can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our freereport on CBAK Energy Technology's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's nice to see that CBAK Energy Technology shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 504% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 12%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

When available, the annual report can be accessed on the Company's investor relations website at https://ir.cbak.com.cn and on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov.\n\nFiscal Year 2020 Financial Highlights\n\nTotal net revenues increased by 69.3% to US$37.6 million from US$22.2 million in fiscal year 2019. Gross profit increased to US$2.7 million from US$0.6 million in fiscal year 2019. Gross margin improved to 7.2% from 2.8% in fiscal year 2019. Net loss decreased to US$7.8 million from US$10.9 million in fiscal year 2019.\n\nMr. Yunfei Li, Chief Executive Officer of CBAK Energy, commented, ""Despite macro challenges in 2020, we grew our top-line by 69.3% year over year. Such robust growth was mainly due to the increased market recognition of our R&D capabilities as well as our higher brand awareness in the energy storage market. With our competitive advantages in R&D and expanded global presence, we remain confident in our future growth prospects. Moreover, our 46800 battery model, 32140 battery model, and special 26650 battery model designed for application in ultra-low temperature environments should enable us to augment our development in the markets for light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, and energy storage to ensure the long-term and sustainable growth of our enterprise value going forward.""\n\nMs. Xiangyu Pei, Interim Chief Financial Officer, further commented, ""In the full year of 2020, we grew our total net revenues while also significantly reducing our net loss. This healthy performance was mainly due to our effective corporate strategy, resilient business model, and operating leverage improvements. As a result of our increased financial capacity from our recent equity offering, we are confident in our ability to continue capitalizing on those opportunities which will emerge going forward to accelerate our development in the post-pandemic world.""\n\nStory continues\n\nFiscal Year 2020 Financial Results\n\nTotal net revenues increased by 69.3% to US$37.6 million in fiscal year 2020 from US$22.2 million in fiscal year 2019.\n\nNet revenues from sales of batteries for electric vehicles decreased to US$259,955 in fiscal year 2020 from US$4.5 million in fiscal year 2019. The decrease was mainly attributable to changes of the Chinese government's new energy vehicle subsidy policies. Net revenues from sales of batteries for light electric vehicles increased by 144.2% to US$39,428 in fiscal year 2020 from US$16,147 in fiscal year 2019. The increase was mainly attributable to the increased market recognition of the Company's brand and products. Net revenues from sales of batteries for uninterruptable supplies increased by 28.7% to US$22.7 million in fiscal year 2020 from US$17.7 million in fiscal year 2019. The increase was mainly attributable to the Company's strategic decision to shift its focus to its development within the market for uninterruptable supplies in 2020. Net revenues from sales of raw materials used in lithium batteries were US$14.5 million in fiscal year 2020, as compared with nil in fiscal year 2019. The increase was mainly attributable to the Company's improved bargaining power with certain suppliers.\n\nCost of revenues increased by 61.6% to US$34.9 million in fiscal year 2020 from US$21.6 million in fiscal year 2019. The increase was in line with the increase in total net revenues, which was partially offset by the cost control improvements and enhancements made by the Company to its production lines in Dalian.\n\nGross profit increased to US$2.7 million in fiscal year 2020 from US$0.6 million in fiscal year 2019. Gross margin improved to 7.2% in fiscal year 2020 from 2.8% in fiscal year 2019.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased to US$11.2 million in fiscal year 2020 from US$10.7 million in the fiscal year 2019.\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased by 11.9% to US$1.7 million in fiscal year 2020 from US$1.9 million in fiscal year 2019. The decrease was primarily a result of the decrease in employees' salaries and social insurance expenses, as the Company suspended its operations in the first quarter of 2020 in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the Chinese government announced a policy to relieve corporations' social security burdens. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 31.3% to US$0.7 million in fiscal year 2020 from US$1.0 million in fiscal year 2019. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in provision for warranty expenses as well as decrease in provisions for employees' salaries and social insurance expenses, as the Company suspended its operations in the first quarter of 2020 in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the Chinese government announced a policy to relieve corporations' social security burdens. General and administrative expenses decreased by 15.1% to US$3.7 million in fiscal year 2020 from US$4.4 million in fiscal year 2019. The decrease was primarily a result of the same reasons which led to a decrease in R&D expenses, partially offset by the Company's continuous efforts to improve its cost management. Property, plant and equipment impairment charge was US$4.3 million in fiscal year 2020, as compared to US$2.3 million in fiscal year 2019. Provision for doubtful accounts decreased to US$0.7 million in the fiscal year 2020 from US$1.0 million in the fiscal year 2019.\n\nOperating loss declined to US$8.5 million in the fiscal year 2020 from US$10.1 million in the fiscal year 2019.\n\nFinance expense, net remained stable at US$1.4 million in the fiscal year 2020, as compared to US$1.4 million in the fiscal year 2019.\n\nOther expenses were US$0.04 million in the fiscal year 2020, as compared to other income of approximately US$0.6 million in the fiscal year 2019.\n\nNet loss declined to US$7.8 million in the fiscal year 2020 from US$10.9 million in the fiscal year 2019.\n\nBasic and diluted net loss per share in fiscal year 2020 were both US$0.10. In comparison, basic and diluted net loss per share in fiscal year 2019 were both US$0.28.\n\nCash and cash equivalents were US$11.7 million as of December 31, 2020, as compared to US$1.6 million in the fiscal year 2019.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nOn February 19, 2021, the Company announced that it has started the trial production of its special 26650 lithium battery (the ""Special 26650 Battery""). Different from the Company's regular 26650 batteries that it is currently manufacturing and selling, the Special 26650 Battery is a self-developed battery model specifically designed for application in ultra-low temperature environments. The Special 26650 Battery has delivered satisfactory test performance results to date, while the trial's production yield rate has also been very close to the Company's required level for mass production. The Company believes that it will be capable of achieving mass delivery for its Special 26650 Battery by the second half of 2021.\n\nOn February 10, 2021, the Company announced that it closed a registered direct placement of approximately $70 million of its common stock, priced at the market under applicable Nasdaq rules with a price of US$7.83 per share, and the concurrent private placement.\n\nOn February 3, 2021, the Company provided additional details for its plans to expand its production capacity in Nanjing and Dalian in anticipation of increasing client orders. For its Nanjing manufacturing plants, the Company plans to attain a total capacity of 8 GWh per year to produce lithium batteries for the light electric vehicle, electric vehicle, and energy storage industries. The Company is currently developing a production line with an annual capacity of 0.7 GWh for its new model 32140 batteries. This production line is expected to be operational by the second half of 2021 and capable of producing 50,000 model 32140 batteries per day.\n\nAbout CBAK Energy\n\nCBAK Energy Technology, Inc. is a leading high-tech enterprise engaged in the development, manufacturing, and sales of new energy high power lithium batteries.

"2021-03-15T13:15:00+00:00","CBAK Energy Partners with a European Hydrogen Energy Giant to Promote Hydrogen Fuel Cell Development","DALIAN, China, March 15, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: CBAT) (""CBAK Energy,"" or the ""Company""), a leading lithium-ion battery manufacturer and electric energy solution provider, today announced that it has signed a memorandum of cooperation (the ""Cooperation"") with a leading European hydrogen energy group with 100 years of operation history (the ""Hydrogen Energy Company"") to promote the development of hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nAs part of the Cooperation, both parties will be able to capitalize on each other's competitive advantages in technological innovation and industrial resources as well as exchange ideas on industry development. At the same time, both parties will be able to actively explore more opportunities to collaborate on high-quality projects going forward, including but not limited to such areas as hydrogen fuel cell production, hydrogen fuel cell stack, hydrogen transportation, hydrogen storage, hydrogen refueling stations, and more. The signing of the Cooperation reflects the mutual belief between both parties that it is a win-win arrangement which will help to advance the broader technological and industrial development of society over the long run.\n\nCompared to diesel fuel, the advantages of hydrogen fuel cells include low noise, zero emissions, and high energy conversion rates. Such advantages help to improve the energy structure, reduce pollution, decrease the greenhouse effect, and contribute to the sustainable development of society. In recent years, as the Chinese government has placed a greater emphasis on the development of hydrogen fuel cells for the automobile industry, hydrogen fuel cells have become an increasingly important part of the Chinese government's strategy to transform automobile power systems and upgrade new energy vehicles. According to an analysis by the China Hydrogen Energy and Fuel Cell Industry Alliance, hydrogen energy will become an increasingly important component of China's overall energy system. As such, by 2050, it is expected that the demand for hydrogen will reach 60 million tons, the number of hydrogen refueling stations will be more than 10,000, and the number of fuel cell vehicles produced annually will reach 5 million. According to research on China's hydrogen fuel cell industry by the Intelligence Research Group, the hydrogen fuel cell industry is still at the early stage of commercial operations. In addition, over the next ten years, as unit costs continue to fall, the industry is expected to grow by more than one hundred times its current size. By 2030, the size of the market for fuel cell vehicles is expected to reach RMB500 billion, while the size of the market for automotive fuel cells is expected to reach RMB120 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nMr. Yunfei Li, Chief Executive Officer of CBAK Energy, commented, ""As a result of the great importance placed upon the transition to more sustainable forms of energy and carbon neutrality by the Chinese government, there is currently an unprecedented number of development opportunities in the market for hydrogen fuel cells. By working together closely, the Hydrogen Energy Company and CBAK Energy will enhance their industry leadership positions as well as attain new achievements in terms of providing basic research, tackling core technologies, and aggregating industrial resources. We are confident that this Cooperation will become a benchmark case study on hydrogen fuel cell cooperation in China, further promoting the low-carbon revolution in energy usage, transformation and upgrade of China's energy structure, and sustainable development of the country's larger economy.""\n\nAbout the Hydrogen Energy Company\n\nThe Hydrogen Energy Company is viewed as a global leader in gases, healthcare, electronics, engineering and construction, and industry.

Smart Electricity Grids\n\nSmart grid is one of the 10 emerging energy technologies you can invest in today. The grid refers to network transmission lines and their stations from the power plant to your houses or business. What makes a grid smart is that the technology provides two-way communication from the utility to its customers. Smart grid controls and measures electric demand and allows automation to work together with the whole system.\n\nThere are several benefits of smart grid systems to business and customers such as efficient transmission, reduced peak demand, increased integration of large-scale renewable energy systems and better integration of customer-owned renewable energy systems.\n\nNowadays, there are some applications that allow EV car owners to sell electricity to the grid during high electricity price cycles. The role of distributed energy resources(DERs) is also increasing. DERs include small and large solar generation facilities, combined heat and power facilities, and energy storage systems.\n\nEven though grid companies are now facing some challenges, they invest a great deal of money in smart grid systems and this inevitably pushes the energy sector higher. Some smart grid companies include:\n\n- Eaton Corporation (NYSE: ETN)\n\nEaton Corporation is an American Irish-domiciled multinational power management company that focuses on the electric grid. With $21.4 billion sales in 2019, the business provides electrical power distribution and control equipment, truck drivetrain systems, engine components, and a wide variety of controls.\n\nThe stock is up over 19% over the last 12 months.\n\n- Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH)\n\nEnphase Energy is a US-based large-cap global company that energy technology company and supplier of solar microinverters besides smart energy systems.\n\nthe stock is up 400% over the last 12 months.\n\n- Quanta Services Inc (NYSE: PWR)\n\nQuanta Services is an American corporation that provides fully integrated infrastructure solutions for the utility, pipeline, energy, and communications industries. One of the business areas is electric power and its distribution including transmission.\n\nThe stock is up 92% over the last 12 months.\n\n- SolarEdge Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: SEDG)\n\nSolarEdge Technologies makes one of the 10 emerging energy technologies you can invest in today. It provides power optimizers, solar inverters, and monitoring systems for photovoltaic arrays besides grid services.\n\nThe stock is up over 197% over the last 12 months\n\n8. Energy Storage\n\nEnergy storage market is thriving globally. The battery technology remains at the focus of this industry.\n\nIn order to compensate for energy imbalances, electricity storage devices manage the amount of power required to supply customers at peak load times. Additionally, these storage devices help make renewable energy smooth by controlling the grid system.\n\nLithium-ion technology continues to be most widely used. But more importantly, the EV sector dominates the sector as EV batteries are ten times greater than grid-scale batteries.\n\nSome top energy storage companies include:\n\n- Eos Energy Enterprises (NASDAQ: EOSE)\n\nEos Energy Enterprises, Inc. designs, manufactures and deploys battery storage solutions for utility, commercial and industrial, and renewable energy markets in the United States. The company’s main focus is on aqueous zinc battery in which was designed to overcome the limitations of conventional lithium-ion technology.\n\nThe stock is up about 192.4% over the last 12 months\n\n- Sunnova Energy International Inc (NYSE: NOVA)\n\nSunnova Energy International Inc is a US-based large-cap company that provides residential solar and energy storage services, with customers across the US and its territories. With home solar systems, battery storage, roof replacement, monitoring, maintenance, and financing options, the company has more than 100k customers.\n\nThe company has a compound YoY revenue growth rate of 27%.\n\n- China BAK Battery (NASDAQ: CBAT)\n\nCBAK Energy Technology is a high-tech enterprise based in Mainland China that is engaged in the R&D, manufacture, and sales of high-power lithium batteries.\n\nCBAT stock is up 891.3% over the last 12 months.\n\n- Flux Power Holdings (NASDAQ: FLUX)\n\nFlux Power, Inc., designs, develops, manufactures, and sells rechargeable lithium-ion energy storage systems for electric forklifts, airport ground support equipment, and other industrial motive applications in the United States.\n\nThe stock is up 96.4% annually over the last 12 months.\n\n7. Innovative Heat Pumps\n\nHeat pump technology and systems cannot be classified as new technologies but can be considered as the future of heating and cooling systems for residential and commercial projects. The heat pump market is likely to see a significant rise in coming years as the EU is looking for technologies to rapidly increase electrification and decarbonization. According to IEA, nearly 20 million households purchased heat pumps in 2019 worldwide. The market’s average annual growth rate has seen a 12% increase since 2015 in Europe.\n\n6. Solar CSP\n\nThe solar boom got a lot of attention worldwide, but apparently the solar technology did not come up to the expectations amid rising costs and declining efficiencies.\n\nThis technology, which is one of the 10 emerging energy technologies you can invest in today, uses a bunch of mirror configurations to concentrate the sunlight energy onto a receiver and convert it to heat. By using the heat, steam is produced, and either a turbine produces electricity or industrial process heat is obtained. The difficulty is having a limit to reach the desired temperature with current exchange fluids. In case it achieves the 1000 degrees Celsius levels with some new technologies, the sector will thrive. It is expected that CSP will see an upward trend through lower installation costs, attractive financing. It is expected that this energy technology capacity could reach up to 9.2 GW through 2025.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Emerging Energy Technologies You Can Invest In Today.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 Biggest Money Transfer Companies In The World 15 Fastest Growing Engineering Fields 15 Biggest Tech Hardware Companies In The World\n\nDisclosure: None. 10 Emerging Energy Technologies You Can Invest In Today is originally published on Insider Monkey.","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-emerging-energy-technologies-invest-163120312.html?.tsrc=rss","APD.US","BBSCX.US","BE.US","BLDP.US","CBAT.US","CMI.US","ENPH.US","EOSE.US","EQNR.US","ETN.US","FCEL.US","","","","","","","","BLOOM ENERGY","CONCENTRATED SOLAR ENERGY","EMERGING ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES","ENERGY MARKET","ENERGY STORAGE","ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES","ENPHASE ENERGY","HYDROGEN ENERGY","HYDROGEN GENERATION","HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGIES","RENEWABLE ENERGY","RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS","RENEWABLE SOURCES","","","1","0.011","0.815","0.174"
