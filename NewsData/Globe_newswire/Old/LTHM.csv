If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member.\n\nAccording to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Livent’s supply contract with Nemaska Lithium Inc. was terminated. As a result, the Company was forced to fulfill customer contracts using different vendors with unfavorable terms, reducing revenues and lowering margins. Livent had a long-standing contract to supply lithium hydroxide to a customer at a significantly lower price than its existing contacts. When the customer increased its orders, the Company’s margins were further squeezed. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the IPO period. When the market learned the truth about Livent, investors suffered damages.\n\nJoin the case to recover your losses.\n\nThe Schall Law Firm represents investors around the world and specializes in securities class action lawsuits and shareholder rights litigation.\n\nThis press release may be considered Attorney Advertising in some jurisdictions under the applicable law and rules of ethics.\n\nCONTACT:\n\nThe Schall Law Firm\r\n Brian Schall, Esq.,\r\nwww.schallfirm.com\r\nOffice: 310-301-3335\r\nCell: 424-303-1964\r\ninfo@schallfirm.com\n\nSOURCE:\n\nThe Schall Law Firm","https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/07/22/1885761/0/en/MONDAY-DEADLINE-ALERT-The-Schall-Law-Firm-Announces-the-Filing-of-a-Class-Action-Lawsuit-Against-Livent-Corporation-and-Encourages-Investors-with-Losses-in-Excess-of-100-000-to-Con.html","LTHM.US","","","","CLASS ACTION","LIVENT","LTHM","SCHALL LAW","SCHALL LAW FIRM","","","","","","-0.926","0.113","0.816","0.071"

On this news, Livent’s share price fell $0.57, over 4%, to close at $12.55 per share on February 12, 2019.\n\nOn May 8, 2019, Livent announced disappointing financial results for first quarter 2019, citing further customer issues.

You can also reach us through the firm's website at www.schallfirm.com or by email at brian@schallfirm.com.\n\nThe class, in this case, has not yet been certified, and until certification occurs, you are not represented by an attorney. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member.\n\nAccording to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Livent’s supply contract with Nemaska Lithium Inc. was terminated. As a result, the Company was forced to fulfill customer contracts using different vendors with unfavorable terms, reducing revenues and lowering margins. Livent had a long-standing contract to supply lithium hydroxide to a customer at a significantly lower price than its existing contacts. When the customer increased its orders, the Company’s margins were further squeezed. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the IPO period. When the market learned the truth about Livent, investors suffered damages.\n\nJoin the case to recover your losses.\n\nThe Schall Law Firm represents investors around the world and specializes in securities class action lawsuits and shareholder rights litigation.\n\nThis press release may be considered Attorney Advertising in some jurisdictions under the applicable law and rules of ethics.\n\nCONTACT:\n\nThe Schall Law Firm\r\n Brian Schall, Esq.,\r\nwww.schallfirm.com\r\nOffice: 310-301-3335\r\nCell: 424-303-1964\r\ninfo@schallfirm.com\n\nSOURCE:\n\nThe Schall Law Firm","https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/06/24/1873288/0/en/INVESTOR-ACTION-REMINDER-The-Schall-Law-Firm-Announces-the-Filing-of-a-Class-Action-Lawsuit-Against-Livent-Corporation-and-Encourages-Investors-with-Losses-in-Excess-of-100-000-to-.html","LTHM.US","","","","CLASS ACTION","LAWSUIT","LIVENT","LTHM","SCHALL LAW","SCHALL LAW FIRM","SHAREHOLDERS","","","","-0.926","0.113","0.816","0.071"

In particular, the Registration Statement failed to disclose that the Company was experiencing material construction delays. These construction delays would cause system deployments (or “acceptances” as Defendants referred to them) to fall significantly below even the low end of the Company’s previously announced guidance. While the Registration Statement purported to warn of risks that “may arise,” which could materially affect the Company, in actuality these material negative events were already occurring. As a result, the representations and purported risk disclosures were false and misleading because, by the time of the IPO, construction delays had already impacted or would soon impact Bloom Energy’s ability to deliver acceptances in line with its guidance.\n\nGet additional information about the BE lawsuit: http://www.kleinstocklaw.com/pslra-1/bloom-energy-corporation-loss-submission-form?wire=3\n\nIndivior PLC (OTCMKTS: INVVY)\r\n Class Period: March 10, 2015 to April 9, 2019\r\n Lead Plaintiff Deadline: June 24, 2019\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Indivior PLC made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose during the class period that: (1) Indivior and its executives engaged in an illicit nationwide scheme to increase prescriptions of Suboxone Film; (2) Indivior illegally obtained billions of dollars in revenue from Suboxone Film prescriptions by deceiving health care providers and health care benefit programs; (3) as a result of the aforementioned misconduct, Indivior would face felony charges; and (4) due to the foregoing, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.\n\nGet additional information about the INVVY lawsuit: http://www.kleinstocklaw.com/pslra-1/indivior-plc-loss-submission-form?wire=3\n\nDynagas LNG Partners LP (NYSE: DLNG)\r\n Class Period: February 16, 2018 to March 21, 2019\r\n Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 16, 2019\n\nThe complaint alleges that throughout the class period Dynagas LNG Partners LP made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: the terms of the Company’s long-term contracts on its liquid natural gas ships, Arctic Aurora and Ob River, were unfavorable and resulted in the Company's inability to sustain its quarterly distributions. As a result of the Defendants’ false and misleading statements and omissions, Dynagas securities traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period. Such inflation was removed when it was revealed that the Arctic Aurora and the Ob River were commencing employment under new extended charter contracts which were at lower rates compared to the previous charter contracts, thereby undermining the Company’s ability to make future distributions.\n\nGet additional information about the DLNG lawsuit: http://www.kleinstocklaw.com/pslra-1/dynagas-lng-partners-lp-loss-submission-form?wire=3\n\nLivent Corporation (NYSE: LTHM)\r\n Class Period: on behalf of persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Livent securities pursuant and/or traceable to initial public offering on or around October 11, 2018.\r\n Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 22, 2019\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Livent Corporation made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose: (1) that a supply contract with Nemaska Lithium Inc. had been terminated; (2) that, as a result, the Company would be forced to fulfill its customer contracts using alternative vendors at reduced revenues and lower margins; (3) that the Company had a long-standing contract to supply lithium hydroxide to a customer at a much lower price than any of the Company's existing contracts; (4) that the Company's margins were squeezed due to the customer's increased orders; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects, were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.\n\nGet additional information about the LTHM lawsuit: http://www.kleinstocklaw.com/pslra-1/livent-corporation-loss-submission-form?wire=3\n\nYour ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

As a result, the Company was forced to fulfill customer contracts using different vendors with unfavorable terms, reducing revenues and lowering margins. Livent had a long-standing contract to supply lithium hydroxide to a customer at a significantly lower price than its existing contacts. When the customer increased its orders, the Company’s margins were further squeezed. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the IPO period.
