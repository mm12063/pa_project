"2022-06-24T15:30:03+00:00","Why Is EnerSys (ENS) Down 15.2% Since Last Earnings Report?","A month has gone by since the last earnings report for EnerSys (ENS). Shares have lost about 15.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is EnerSys due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nEnerSys Q4 Earnings and Revenues Surpass Estimates\n\nEnerSys reported better-than-expected results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 31, 2022). EnerSys’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.4% while sales beat the same by 2.9%.\r\n\r\nENS’ earnings in the quarter under review were $1.20 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15. However, the bottom line declined 7.7% from the year-ago figure of $1.30 as higher costs and expenses more than offset the positive impacts of revenue growth.\r\n\r\nIn fiscal 2022, EnerSys’ earnings came in at $4.47, down 0.4% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nRevenue Details\n\nIn the quarter under review, EnerSys’ revenues were $907 million, up 11.5% from the year-ago quarter’s level. Organic sales in the quarter grew 8% on the back of strengthening markets. Pricing positively impacted sales by 6% while forex woes left a negative impact of 2%.\r\n\r\nOn a sequential basis, ENS revenues increased 7.5%.\r\n\r\nExiting the reported quarter, EnerSys had a backlog of $1.3 billion.\r\n\r\nENS’ revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $881 million.\r\n\r\nGeographically, ENS' net sales increased 16% year over year to $643 million in the Americas, while the metric witnessed growth of 1% to $204 million in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Sales in Asia were $59 million, reflecting an increase of 9% from the year-ago quarter’s level.\r\n\r\nIts segmental performance for the fiscal fourth quarter is briefly discussed below:\r\n\r\nEnergy Systems' sales were $410 million, contributing 45.2% to net revenues in the quarter under review. On a year-over-year basis, the segment's revenues increased 18%. Volume was up 13% while pricing had a positive impact of 6%. Adverse foreign currency translations hurt 2%.\r\n\r\nThe Motive Power segment generated revenues of $365 million, contributing 40.2% to net revenues in the reported quarter. The figure increased 10% year over year based on 6% growth in volumes and a 6% positive contribution from pricing. Forex woes left a negative impact of 3%.\r\n\r\nSpecialty's sales were $132 million, contributing 14.6% to net revenues in the quarter under review. On a year-over-year basis, the segment's revenues remained flat. Pricing had a positive impact of 3% on the quarter, while volumes and foreign currency translations had negative impacts of 2% and 1%, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn fiscal 2022, EnerSys’ net sales came in at $ 3,357.3 million, up 12.7% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMargin Profile\n\nIn the reported quarter, EnerSys' cost of sales increased 15.6% year over year to $712.4 million. The cost of sales was 78.5% of the quarter's net sales. The gross profit in the quarter decreased 1.4% year over year to $194.6 million, while the gross margin fell 280 basis points (bps) year over year to 21.5%.\r\n\r\nOperating expenses increased 12.3% year over year to $140.3 million. ENS represented 15.5% of net sales in the reported quarter compared with 15.4% in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating earnings were $66.8 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 14.8%. Margin decreased 220 bps year over year to 7.4%.\r\n\r\nENS' performance in the quarter suffered cost inflation and supply-chain constraints. However, pricing actions were a relief.\n\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\n\nExiting fiscal 2022, EnerSys had cash and cash equivalents of $402.5 million, down 10.9% from $451.8 million recorded in the last reported year. Long-term debt increased 4.1% sequentially to $1,243 million.\r\n\r\nIn fiscal 2022, ENS repaid a term loan of $161.4 million and revolving credit borrowings of $88.4 million. However, proceeds for revolving credit borrowings were $523.4 million in fiscal 2022.\r\n\r\nEnerSys used net cash of $65.6 million for its operating activities in fiscal 2022 against a net cash generation of $358.4 million in fiscal 2021. Capital expenditure totaled $74 million compared with $70 million in the previous year.\r\n\r\nEnerSys rewarded its shareholders with a dividend payout of $29.4 million in fiscal 2022. Share repurchased amounted to $156.4 million. ENS is left to buy back shares worth $163 million.\n\nOutlook\n\nEnerSys anticipates gaining from healthy demand, effective pricing and technological expertise in the quarters ahead. Cost inflation is worrisome. Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 are expected to be $1.10-$1.20 per share.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, EnerSys has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, EnerSys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"2022-06-22T14:54:15+00:00","Are Investors Undervaluing EnerSys (NYSE:ENS) By 29%?","Does the June share price for EnerSys (NYSE:ENS) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for EnerSys\n\nThe calculation\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  -US$14.9m US$241.7m US$242.2m US$243.9m US$246.5m US$249.8m US$253.6m US$257.7m US$262.1m US$266.8m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x3 Analyst x3 Analyst x3 Est @ 0.71% Est @ 1.07% Est @ 1.33% Est @ 1.51% Est @ 1.63% Est @ 1.72% Est @ 1.78% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2%  -US$13.8 US$206 US$191 US$178 US$166 US$156 US$146 US$137 US$129 US$121\n\n(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.4b\n\nStory continues\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2031 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$267m× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (8.2%– 1.9%) = US$4.3b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.3b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$2.0b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.4b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$59.2, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nImportant assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at EnerSys as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.478. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For EnerSys, there are three essential factors you should assess:\n\nRisks: For instance, we've identified  2 warning signs for EnerSys (1 shouldn't be ignored)  you should be aware of.

"2022-06-10T19:09:07+00:00","EnerSys (ENS) Exhibits Strong Prospects Despite Headwinds","EnerSys ENS is likely to gain from its presence in the diverse end markets, which allows it to nullify risks associated with a single market. In the quarters ahead, improving demand environment across defense, transportation and lithium-based battery technology end markets is likely to benefit ENS in the quarters ahead. Its organic volumes increased 8% and pricing had a favorable impact of 6% on fourth-quarter fiscal 2022. Also, ENS’ technological expertise and focus on product innovation are likely to drive its performance over time.\r\n\r\nENS intends to become more competent on the back of its solid product portfolio over time. EnerSys is a leading provider of NexSys Thin Plate Pure Lead product in the market. In the long term, ENS stands to benefit from favorable trends, including EV charging, home energy storage, rural broadband and 5G buildout products.\r\n\r\nEnerSys focuses on rewarding its shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. ENS paid out dividends worth $29.4 million and bought back shares worth $156.4 million in fiscal 2022. ENS also launched a share buyback program in March 2022 with no expiration date. Through this program, management intends to buy back shares worth $150 million.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenges related to supply chain and cost woes pose a concern. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, ENS’ cost of sales and operating expenses increased 15.6% and 12.3%, respectively, while the gross margin decreased 280 basis points (bps) and the operating margin fell 220 bps. High freight costs, shortages of product components and labor constraints might be concerning for EnerSys in the quarters ahead.\r\n\r\nEnerSys’ global presence exposes it to various environmental laws and regulations in its operating countries. Also, ENS remains vulnerable to foreign-currency and geopolitical issues. Forex woes hampered sales by 2% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter. In the quarters ahead, ENS’ overseas business might be depressed by a stronger U.S. dollar.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn the past three months, this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has dropped 10.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 7.6%.\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nSome better-ranked companies from the industrial products sector are discussed below:\r\n\r\nApplied Industrial Technologies, Inc.

Demand across all segments continued to surge, with fourth quarter net sales of $907 million eclipsing $900 million for the first time in our company’s history and our backlog growing to $1.3 billion, breaking new records for the third consecutive quarter. Our pricing actions are continuing to catch up with our significant cost increases, driving a 19% sequential increase in adjusted diluted EPS despite ongoing and mounting supply chain headwinds, labor shortages, and historic inflation levels. While pricing has not yet caught up with the persisting inflation endured this fiscal year, we are pleased with the trajectory our teams are making to recapture our underlying financial potential. For reference, the inflation and supply chain disruptions created nearly $3 per share of sequential pressure in fiscal 2022. Approximately two-thirds of this pressure was offset in the fiscal year as we continue to chase these pressures with price and mix.\n\nWe achieved several key milestones in fiscal 2022, including the launch and UL safety listing of our high-performance NexSys® lithium iON batteries which feature an integrated Battery Management System (BMS) that performs auto-diagnosis, voltage limitation, and communication of performance data. We also exceeded our capacity goal for our Thin Plate Pure Lead (TPPL) batteries. Customer demand for this proprietary technology across all of our business segments continues to outpace our ability to supply. We expect to benefit further from the strength of this demand as we make progress toward increasing capacity by an additional $200 million in fiscal 2023. I am also pleased to note we made significant progress on our ESG goals, including several sustainability and environment updates that culminated in the publication of our first comprehensive sustainability report in April 2022. The report highlights the critical role our power and energy solutions play in building a resilient, low-carbon future and are a key component to decarbonization globally.\n\nAs we enter fiscal 2023, we expect to face ongoing challenges with continued supply chain constraints and inflation exacerbated by the senseless conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the resurgence of Covid in China. We remain focused on what is in our control, catching inflation with ongoing price increases, navigating supply disruptions, and improving manufacturing cost performance. I am proud of our employees’ resilience and proven ability to address these challenges head on. Despite these near-term headwinds, we are optimistic about our ability to persevere and capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us. We believe we are well positioned for accelerated growth once the current macro headwinds subside. We are committed to being good corporate citizens and delivering long-term value to our shareholders through profitable growth and a disciplined capital allocation strategy.\n\nDavid M. Shaffer, President and Chief Executive Officer, EnerSys\n\nSummary of Results\n\nFourth Quarter 2022\n\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 were $907.0 million, an increase of 11.5% from the prior year fourth quarter net sales of $813.5 million and increased 7.5% sequentially from the third quarter of fiscal 2022 net sales of $844.0 million. The increase compared to prior year quarter was the result of an 8% increase in organic volume resulting primarily from strong demand arising from robust markets and the easing of the pandemic and a 6% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. The sequential increase was due to a 6% increase in organic volume and a 2% increase in pricing.\n\nNet earnings attributable to EnerSys stockholders (“Net earnings”) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $28.1 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $22.0 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nNet earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was $33.8 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $22.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nExcluding these highlighted items, adjusted Net earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, on a non-GAAP basis, were $1.20, compared to the guidance of $1.11 to $1.21 per diluted share for the fourth quarter given by the Company on February 9, 2022. These earnings compare to the prior year fourth quarter adjusted Net earnings of $1.30 per diluted share. Please refer to the section included herein under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the Company’s use of non-GAAP adjusted financial information, which includes tables reconciling GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021.\n\nSummary of Results\n\nFiscal Year 2022\n\nNet sales for the twelve months of fiscal 2022 were $3,357.3 million, an increase of 12.7% from the prior year twelve months net sales of $2,977.9 million. This increase was due to a 10% increase in organic volume resulting primarily from strong demand and a 3% increase in pricing.\n\nNet earnings for the twelve months of fiscal 2022 was $143.9 million, or $3.36 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $47.1 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nNet earnings for the twelve months of fiscal 2021 was $143.3 million, or $3.32 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $50.8 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nAdjusted Net earnings per diluted share for the twelve months of fiscal 2022, on a non-GAAP basis, were $4.47. This compares to the prior year twelve months adjusted Net earnings of $4.49 per diluted share. Please refer to the section included herein under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the Company’s use of non-GAAP adjusted financial information.\n\nFirst Quarter 2023 Outlook\n\nMacro headwinds from supply chain constraints, increasing interest rates and increased inflationary challenges have only been fueled by geopolitical events of the past quarter, and we anticipate these will not dramatically subside this calendar year. We will continue to take necessary pricing actions and expect to see ongoing mix benefits of our product redesign and re-sourcing efforts continuing throughout the year. We remain well-positioned to capitalize heavily on robust market demand in exciting end-markets, our strong order book, and price stickiness once the current macro environment normalizes, and we are tracking to our strategic plan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.10 to $1.20, with our pricing keeping pace with mounting inflation and FX gains in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 not repeating. We expect our gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to be in the range of 21% - 23%. For the full year of fiscal 2023 we expect capital expenditure to be approximately $100 million.\n\nConference Call and Webcast Details\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results at 9:00 AM (EST) Thursday, May 26, 2022.

EnerSys' management uses the non-GAAP measures “adjusted Net earnings”, “adjusted Diluted EPS”, “adjusted operating earnings” and “adjusted EBITDA” as applicable, in their analysis of the Company's performance. Adjusted Net earnings and adjusted operating earnings measure, as used by EnerSys in past quarters and years, adjusts Net earnings and operating earnings determined in accordance with GAAP to reflect changes in financial results associated with the Company's restructuring initiatives and other highlighted charges and income items. Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure as an overall assessment of our performance, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and for business planning purposes. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest income, interest expense, other (income) expense net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude restructuring and exit activities, impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and other assets, acquisition activities and those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance. EBITDA is calculated as net income before interest income, interest expense, other (income) expense net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management believes the presentation of these financial measures reflecting these non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results and overall business performance; in particular, those charges that the Company incurs as a result of restructuring activities, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and other assets, acquisition activities and those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, such as significant legal proceedings, amortization of Alpha and NorthStar related intangible assets and tax valuation allowance changes, including those related to the AHV (Old-Age and Survivors Insurance) Financing (TRAF) in Switzerland. Because these charges are not incurred as a result of ongoing operations, or are incurred as a result of a potential or previous acquisition, they are not as helpful a measure of the performance of our underlying business, particularly in light of their unpredictable nature and are difficult to forecast. Although we exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles from these non-GAAP measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.\n\nIncome tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated using the applicable statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the charges (benefits) are incurred, while taking into consideration any valuation allowances. For those items which are non-taxable, the tax expense (benefit) is calculated at 0%.\n\nThese non-GAAP disclosures have limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for operating earnings, Net earnings or net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Management believes that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding the Company's ongoing operating results. This supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to Net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted operating earnings is set forth in the table below, providing a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted operating earnings to the Company’s reported operating results for its business segments.\n\nBusiness Segment Operating Results\n\nQuarter ended ($ millions) March 31, 2022 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Net Sales $ 410.4 $ 364.9 $ 131.7 $ 907.0 Operating Earnings  $ 4.7 $ 29.8 $ 10.0 $ 44.5 Inventory adjustment relating to exit activities 0.2 1.4 — 1.6 Restructuring and other exit charges 1.4 4.2 — 5.6 Impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles 0.5 0.7 — 1.2 Loss on assets held for sale — 3.0 — 3.0 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 5.8 — 0.5 6.3 Other 3.3 1.0 0.3 4.6 Adjusted Operating Earnings  $ 15.9 $ 40.1 $ 10.8 $ 66.8\n\nQuarter ended ($ millions) March 31, 2021 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Net Sales $ 348.8 $ 332.8 $ 131.9 $ 813.5 Operating Earnings  $ 3.1 $ 31.9 $ 16.7 $ 51.7 Restructuring and other exit charges 0.5 20.0 0.2 20.7 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 5.5 — 0.5 6.0 Adjusted Operating Earnings  $ 9.1 $ 51.9 $ 17.4 $ 78.4\n\nIncrease (Decrease) % from prior year quarter Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Net Sales 17.6 % 9.7 % (0.2 )% 11.5 % Operating Earnings 51.4 (6.4 ) (40.2 ) (13.9 ) Adjusted Operating Earnings 74.0 (22.7 ) (38.0 ) (14.8 )\n\nTwelve months ended ($ millions) March 31, 2022 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Net Sales $ 1,536.6 $ 1,361.2 $ 459.5 $ 3,357.3 Operating Earnings  $ 15.1 $ 146.5 $ 44.6 $ 206.2 Inventory adjustment relating to exit activities 0.2 2.4 — 2.6 Restructuring and other exit charges 2.8 17.1 (1.1 ) 18.8 Impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles 0.5 0.7 — 1.2 Loss on assets held for sale — 3.0 — 3.0 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 23.6 — 1.8 25.4 Other 5.1 1.0 0.3 6.4 Adjusted Operating Earnings  $ 47.3 $ 170.7 $ 45.6 $ 263.6\n\nTwelve months ended ($ millions) March 31, 2021 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Net Sales $ 1,380.2 $ 1,163.8 $ 433.9 $ 2,977.9 Operating Earnings  $ 63.8 $ 106.7 $ 45.9 $ 216.4 Restructuring and other exit charges 3.1 36.9 0.4 40.4 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 23.5 — 1.8 25.3 Acquisition activity expense 0.2 — 0.1 0.3 Other 1.5 0.3 — 1.8 Adjusted Operating Earnings  $ 92.1 $ 143.9 $ 48.2 $ 284.2\n\nIncrease (Decrease) over prior year Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Net Sales 11.3 % 17.0 % 5.9 % 12.7 % Operating Earnings (76.3 ) 37.4 (2.7 ) (4.7 ) Adjusted Operating Earnings (48.8 ) 18.8 (5.2 ) (7.2 )\n\nReconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures \r\n(Unaudited)\n\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of Net Earnings to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n\nQuarter ended  Twelve months ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 Net Earnings $ 28.1 $ 33.8 $ 143.9 $ 143.3 Depreciation 15.3 15.8 62.6 60.9 Amortization 8.2 8.1 33.2 33.4 Interest 9.4 9.1 37.8 38.5 Income Taxes 10.8 9.4 30.0 26.8 EBITDA 71.8 76.2 307.5 302.9 Non-GAAP adjustments 16.0 20.7 32.0 42.5 Adjusted EBITDA $ 87.8 $ 96.9 $ 339.5 $ 345.4\n\nThe following table provides the non-GAAP adjustments shown in the reconciliation above:\n\nQuarter ended  Twelve months ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 Inventory adjustment relating to exit activities $ 1.6 $ 0.0 $ 2.6 $ — Restructuring and other exit charges 5.6 20.7 18.8 40.4 Impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles 1.2 — 1.2 — Loss on assets held for sale 3.0 — 3.0 — Acquisition activity expense — — — 0.3 Other 4.6 — 6.4 1.8 Non-GAAP adjustments $ 16.0 $ 20.7 $ 32.0 $ 42.5\n\nIncluded below is a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted Net earnings to reported amounts.

Demand across all segments continued to surge, with fourth quarter net sales of $907 million eclipsing $900 million for the first time in our company’s history and our backlog growing to $1.3 billion, breaking new records for the third consecutive quarter. Our pricing actions are continuing to catch up with our significant cost increases, driving a 19% sequential increase in adjusted diluted EPS despite ongoing and mounting supply chain headwinds, labor shortages, and historic inflation levels. While pricing has not yet caught up with the persisting inflation endured this fiscal year, we are pleased with the trajectory our teams are making to recapture our underlying financial potential. For reference, the inflation and supply chain disruptions created nearly $3 per share of sequential pressure in fiscal 2022. Approximately two-thirds of this pressure was offset in the fiscal year as we continue to chase these pressures with price and mix.\n\nWe achieved several key milestones in fiscal 2022, including the launch and UL safety listing of our high-performance NexSys® lithium iON batteries which feature an integrated Battery Management System (BMS) that performs auto-diagnosis, voltage limitation, and communication of performance data. We also exceeded our capacity goal for our Thin Plate Pure Lead (TPPL) batteries. Customer demand for this proprietary technology across all of our business segments continues to outpace our ability to supply. We expect to benefit further from the strength of this demand as we make progress toward increasing capacity by an additional $200 million in fiscal 2023. I am also pleased to note we made significant progress on our ESG goals, including several sustainability and environment updates that culminated in the publication of our first comprehensive sustainability report in April 2022. The report highlights the critical role our power and energy solutions play in building a resilient, low-carbon future and are a key component to decarbonization globally.\n\nAs we enter fiscal 2023, we expect to face ongoing challenges with continued supply chain constraints and inflation exacerbated by the senseless conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the resurgence of Covid in China. We remain focused on what is in our control, catching inflation with ongoing price increases, navigating supply disruptions, and improving manufacturing cost performance. I am proud of our employees’ resilience and proven ability to address these challenges head on. Despite these near-term headwinds, we are optimistic about our ability to persevere and capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us. We believe we are well positioned for accelerated growth once the current macro headwinds subside. We are committed to being good corporate citizens and delivering long-term value to our shareholders through profitable growth and a disciplined capital allocation strategy.\n\nDavid M. Shaffer, President and Chief Executive Officer, EnerSys\n\nSummary of Results\n\nFourth Quarter 2022\n\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 were $907.0 million, an increase of 11.5% from the prior year fourth quarter net sales of $813.5 million and increased 7.5% sequentially from the third quarter of fiscal 2022 net sales of $844.0 million. The increase compared to prior year quarter was the result of an 8% increase in organic volume resulting primarily from strong demand arising from robust markets and the easing of the pandemic and a 6% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. The sequential increase was due to a 6% increase in organic volume and a 2% increase in pricing.\n\nNet earnings attributable to EnerSys stockholders (“Net earnings”) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $28.1 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $22.0 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nNet earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was $33.8 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $22.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nExcluding these highlighted items, adjusted Net earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, on a non-GAAP basis, were $1.20, compared to the guidance of $1.11 to $1.21 per diluted share for the fourth quarter given by the Company on February 9, 2022. These earnings compare to the prior year fourth quarter adjusted Net earnings of $1.30 per diluted share. Please refer to the section included herein under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the Company’s use of non-GAAP adjusted financial information, which includes tables reconciling GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021.\n\nSummary of Results\n\nFiscal Year 2022\n\nNet sales for the twelve months of fiscal 2022 were $3,357.3 million, an increase of 12.7% from the prior year twelve months net sales of $2,977.9 million. This increase was due to a 10% increase in organic volume resulting primarily from strong demand and a 3% increase in pricing.\n\nNet earnings for the twelve months of fiscal 2022 was $143.9 million, or $3.36 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $47.1 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nNet earnings for the twelve months of fiscal 2021 was $143.3 million, or $3.32 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $50.8 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nAdjusted Net earnings per diluted share for the twelve months of fiscal 2022, on a non-GAAP basis, were $4.47. This compares to the prior year twelve months adjusted Net earnings of $4.49 per diluted share. Please refer to the section included herein under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the Company’s use of non-GAAP adjusted financial information.\n\nFirst Quarter 2023 Outlook\n\nMacro headwinds from supply chain constraints, increasing interest rates and increased inflationary challenges have only been fueled by geopolitical events of the past quarter, and we anticipate these will not dramatically subside this calendar year. We will continue to take necessary pricing actions and expect to see ongoing mix benefits of our product redesign and re-sourcing efforts continuing throughout the year. We remain well-positioned to capitalize heavily on robust market demand in exciting end-markets, our strong order book, and price stickiness once the current macro environment normalizes, and we are tracking to our strategic plan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.10 to $1.20, with our pricing keeping pace with mounting inflation and FX gains in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 not repeating. We expect our gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to be in the range of 21% - 23%. For the full year of fiscal 2023 we expect capital expenditure to be approximately $100 million.\n\nConference Call and Webcast Details\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results at 9:00 AM (EST) Thursday, May 26, 2022.

EnerSys' management uses the non-GAAP measures “adjusted Net earnings”, “adjusted Diluted EPS”, “adjusted operating earnings” and “adjusted EBITDA” as applicable, in their analysis of the Company's performance. Adjusted Net earnings and adjusted operating earnings measure, as used by EnerSys in past quarters and years, adjusts Net earnings and operating earnings determined in accordance with GAAP to reflect changes in financial results associated with the Company's restructuring initiatives and other highlighted charges and income items. Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure as an overall assessment of our performance, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and for business planning purposes. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest income, interest expense, other (income) expense net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude restructuring and exit activities, impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and other assets, acquisition activities and those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance. EBITDA is calculated as net income before interest income, interest expense, other (income) expense net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management believes the presentation of these financial measures reflecting these non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results and overall business performance; in particular, those charges that the Company incurs as a result of restructuring activities, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and other assets, acquisition activities and those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, such as significant legal proceedings, amortization of Alpha and NorthStar related intangible assets and tax valuation allowance changes, including those related to the AHV (Old-Age and Survivors Insurance) Financing (TRAF) in Switzerland. Because these charges are not incurred as a result of ongoing operations, or are incurred as a result of a potential or previous acquisition, they are not as helpful a measure of the performance of our underlying business, particularly in light of their unpredictable nature and are difficult to forecast. Although we exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles from these non-GAAP measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.\n\nIncome tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated using the applicable statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the charges (benefits) are incurred, while taking into consideration any valuation allowances. For those items which are non-taxable, the tax expense (benefit) is calculated at 0%.\n\nThese non-GAAP disclosures have limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for operating earnings, Net earnings or net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Management believes that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding the Company's ongoing operating results. This supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to Net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted operating earnings is set forth in the table below, providing a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted operating earnings to the Company’s reported operating results for its business segments.\n\nBusiness Segment Operating Results\n\nQuarter ended ($ millions) March 31, 2022 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty TotalNet Sales$410.4  $364.9  $131.7  $907.0  Operating Earnings $4.7  $29.8  $10.0  $44.5 Inventory adjustment relating to exit activities 0.2   1.4   —   1.6 Restructuring and other exit charges 1.4   4.2   —   5.6 Impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles 0.5   0.7   —   1.2 Loss on assets held for sale —   3.0   —   3.0 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 5.8   —   0.5   6.3 Other 3.3   1.0   0.3   4.6 Adjusted Operating Earnings $15.9  $40.1  $10.8  $66.8\n\nQuarter ended ($ millions) March 31, 2021 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty TotalNet Sales$348.8  $332.8  $131.9  $813.5  Operating Earnings $3.1  $31.9  $16.7  $51.7 Restructuring and other exit charges 0.5   20.0   0.2   20.7 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 5.5   —   0.5   6.0 Adjusted Operating Earnings $9.1  $51.9  $17.4  $78.4\n\nIncrease (Decrease) % from prior year quarterEnergy Systems Motive Power Specialty TotalNet Sales17.6% 9.7% (0.2)% 11.5%Operating Earnings51.4  (6.4) (40.2) (13.9)Adjusted Operating Earnings74.0  (22.7) (38.0) (14.8)\n\nTwelve months ended ($ millions) March 31, 2022 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty TotalNet Sales$1,536.6  $1,361.2  $459.5  $3,357.3  Operating Earnings $15.1  $146.5  $44.6  $206.2 Inventory adjustment relating to exit activities 0.2   2.4   —   2.6 Restructuring and other exit charges 2.8   17.1   (1.1)  18.8 Impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles 0.5   0.7   —   1.2 Loss on assets held for sale —   3.0   —   3.0 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 23.6   —   1.8   25.4 Other 5.1   1.0   0.3   6.4 Adjusted Operating Earnings $47.3  $170.7  $45.6  $263.6\n\nTwelve months ended ($ millions) March 31, 2021 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty TotalNet Sales$1,380.2  $1,163.8  $433.9  $2,977.9  Operating Earnings $63.8  $106.7  $45.9  $216.4 Restructuring and other exit charges 3.1   36.9   0.4   40.4 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 23.5   —   1.8   25.3 Acquisition activity expense 0.2   —   0.1   0.3 Other 1.5   0.3   —   1.8 Adjusted Operating Earnings $92.1  $143.9  $48.2  $284.2\n\nIncrease (Decrease) over prior yearEnergy Systems Motive Power Specialty TotalNet Sales11.3% 17.0% 5.9% 12.7%Operating Earnings(76.3) 37.4  (2.7) (4.7)Adjusted Operating Earnings(48.8) 18.8  (5.2) (7.2)\n\nReconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures \r\n(Unaudited)\n\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of Net Earnings to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n\nQuarter ended  Twelve months ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021Net Earnings$28.1  $33.8  $143.9  $143.3 Depreciation 15.3   15.8   62.6   60.9 Amortization 8.2   8.1   33.2   33.4 Interest 9.4   9.1   37.8   38.5 Income Taxes 10.8   9.4   30.0   26.8 EBITDA 71.8   76.2   307.5   302.9 Non-GAAP adjustments 16.0   20.7   32.0   42.5 Adjusted EBITDA$87.8  $96.9  $339.5  $345.4\n\nThe following table provides the non-GAAP adjustments shown in the reconciliation above:\n\nQuarter ended  Twelve months ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021Inventory adjustment relating to exit activities$1.6  $0.0  $2.6  $— Restructuring and other exit charges 5.6   20.7   18.8   40.4 Impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles 1.2   —   1.2   — Loss on assets held for sale 3.0   —   3.0   — Acquisition activity expense —   —   —   0.3 Other 4.6   —   6.4   1.8 Non-GAAP adjustments$16.0  $20.7  $32.0  $42.5\n\nIncluded below is a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted Net earnings to reported amounts.

Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is further adjusted for certain charges such as restructuring activities, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and other assets, acquisition activities and other charges and credits as discussed under Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\n\nMessage from the CEO\n\nThe March quarter marked a strong finish to a challenging year. Demand across all segments continued to surge, with fourth quarter net sales of $907 million eclipsing $900 million for the first time in our company’s history and our backlog growing to $1.3 billion, breaking new records for the third consecutive quarter. Our pricing actions are continuing to catch up with our significant cost increases, driving a 19% sequential increase in adjusted diluted EPS despite ongoing and mounting supply chain headwinds, labor shortages, and historic inflation levels. While pricing has not yet caught up with the persisting inflation endured this fiscal year, we are pleased with the trajectory our teams are making to recapture our underlying financial potential. For reference, the inflation and supply chain disruptions created nearly $3 per share of sequential pressure in fiscal 2022. Approximately two-thirds of this pressure was offset in the fiscal year as we continue to chase these pressures with price and mix.\n\nWe achieved several key milestones in fiscal 2022, including the launch and UL safety listing of our high-performance NexSys® lithium iON batteries which feature an integrated Battery Management System (BMS) that performs auto-diagnosis, voltage limitation, and communication of performance data. We also exceeded our capacity goal for our Thin Plate Pure Lead (TPPL) batteries. Customer demand for this proprietary technology across all of our business segments continues to outpace our ability to supply. We expect to benefit further from the strength of this demand as we make progress toward increasing capacity by an additional $200 million in fiscal 2023. I am also pleased to note we made significant progress on our ESG goals, including several sustainability and environment updates that culminated in the publication of our first comprehensive sustainability report in April 2022. The report highlights the critical role our power and energy solutions play in building a resilient, low-carbon future and are a key component to decarbonization globally.\n\nAs we enter fiscal 2023, we expect to face ongoing challenges with continued supply chain constraints and inflation exacerbated by the senseless conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the resurgence of Covid in China. We remain focused on what is in our control, catching inflation with ongoing price increases, navigating supply disruptions, and improving manufacturing cost performance. I am proud of our employees’ resilience and proven ability to address these challenges head on. Despite these near-term headwinds, we are optimistic about our ability to persevere and capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us. We believe we are well positioned for accelerated growth once the current macro headwinds subside. We are committed to being good corporate citizens and delivering long-term value to our shareholders through profitable growth and a disciplined capital allocation strategy.\n\nDavid M. Shaffer, President and Chief Executive Officer, EnerSys\n\nSummary of Results\n\nFourth Quarter 2022\n\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 were $907.0 million, an increase of 11.5% from the prior year fourth quarter net sales of $813.5 million and increased 7.5% sequentially from the third quarter of fiscal 2022 net sales of $844.0 million. The increase compared to prior year quarter was the result of an 8% increase in organic volume resulting primarily from strong demand arising from robust markets and the easing of the pandemic and a 6% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. The sequential increase was due to a 6% increase in organic volume and a 2% increase in pricing.\n\nNet earnings attributable to EnerSys stockholders (“Net earnings”) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $28.1 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $22.0 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nNet earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was $33.8 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $22.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nExcluding these highlighted items, adjusted Net earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, on a non-GAAP basis, were $1.20, compared to the guidance of $1.11 to $1.21 per diluted share for the fourth quarter given by the Company on February 9, 2022. These earnings compare to the prior year fourth quarter adjusted Net earnings of $1.30 per diluted share. Please refer to the section included herein under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the Company’s use of non-GAAP adjusted financial information, which includes tables reconciling GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021.\n\nSummary of Results\n\nFiscal Year 2022\n\nNet sales for the twelve months of fiscal 2022 were $3,357.3 million, an increase of 12.7% from the prior year twelve months net sales of $2,977.9 million. This increase was due to a 10% increase in organic volume resulting primarily from strong demand and a 3% increase in pricing.\n\nNet earnings for the twelve months of fiscal 2022 was $143.9 million, or $3.36 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $47.1 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nNet earnings for the twelve months of fiscal 2021 was $143.3 million, or $3.32 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $50.8 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nAdjusted Net earnings per diluted share for the twelve months of fiscal 2022, on a non-GAAP basis, were $4.47. This compares to the prior year twelve months adjusted Net earnings of $4.49 per diluted share. Please refer to the section included herein under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the Company’s use of non-GAAP adjusted financial information.\n\nFirst Quarter 2023 Outlook\n\nMacro headwinds from supply chain constraints, increasing interest rates and increased inflationary challenges have only been fueled by geopolitical events of the past quarter, and we anticipate these will not dramatically subside this calendar year. We will continue to take necessary pricing actions and expect to see ongoing mix benefits of our product redesign and re-sourcing efforts continuing throughout the year. We remain well-positioned to capitalize heavily on robust market demand in exciting end-markets, our strong order book, and price stickiness once the current macro environment normalizes, and we are tracking to our strategic plan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.10 to $1.20, with our pricing keeping pace with mounting inflation and FX gains in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 not repeating. We expect our gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to be in the range of 21% - 23%. For the full year of fiscal 2023 we expect capital expenditure to be approximately $100 million.\n\nConference Call and Webcast Details\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results at 9:00 AM (EST) Thursday, May 26, 2022.

Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure as an overall assessment of our performance, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and for business planning purposes. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest income, interest expense, other (income) expense net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude restructuring and exit activities, impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and other assets, acquisition activities and those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance. EBITDA is calculated as net income before interest income, interest expense, other (income) expense net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management believes the presentation of these financial measures reflecting these non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results and overall business performance; in particular, those charges that the Company incurs as a result of restructuring activities, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and other assets, acquisition activities and those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, such as significant legal proceedings, amortization of Alpha and NorthStar related intangible assets and tax valuation allowance changes, including those related to the AHV (Old-Age and Survivors Insurance) Financing (TRAF) in Switzerland. Because these charges are not incurred as a result of ongoing operations, or are incurred as a result of a potential or previous acquisition, they are not as helpful a measure of the performance of our underlying business, particularly in light of their unpredictable nature and are difficult to forecast. Although we exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles from these non-GAAP measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.\n\nIncome tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated using the applicable statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the charges (benefits) are incurred, while taking into consideration any valuation allowances. For those items which are non-taxable, the tax expense (benefit) is calculated at 0%.\n\nThese non-GAAP disclosures have limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for operating earnings, Net earnings or net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Management believes that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding the Company's ongoing operating results. This supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to Net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted operating earnings is set forth in the table below, providing a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted operating earnings to the Company’s reported operating results for its business segments.\n\nBusiness Segment Operating Results\n\nQuarter ended ($ millions) March 31, 2022 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Net Sales $ 410.4 $ 364.9 $ 131.7 $ 907.0 Operating Earnings  $ 4.7 $ 29.8 $ 10.0 $ 44.5 Inventory adjustment relating to exit activities 0.2 1.4 — 1.6 Restructuring and other exit charges 1.4 4.2 — 5.6 Impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles 0.5 0.7 — 1.2 Loss on assets held for sale — 3.0 — 3.0 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 5.8 — 0.5 6.3 Other 3.3 1.0 0.3 4.6 Adjusted Operating Earnings  $ 15.9 $ 40.1 $ 10.8 $ 66.8\n\nQuarter ended ($ millions) March 31, 2021 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Net Sales $ 348.8 $ 332.8 $ 131.9 $ 813.5 Operating Earnings  $ 3.1 $ 31.9 $ 16.7 $ 51.7 Restructuring and other exit charges 0.5 20.0 0.2 20.7 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 5.5 — 0.5 6.0 Adjusted Operating Earnings  $ 9.1 $ 51.9 $ 17.4 $ 78.4\n\nIncrease (Decrease) % from prior year quarter Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Net Sales 17.6 % 9.7 % (0.2 )% 11.5 % Operating Earnings 51.4 (6.4 ) (40.2 ) (13.9 ) Adjusted Operating Earnings 74.0 (22.7 ) (38.0 ) (14.8 )\n\nTwelve months ended ($ millions) March 31, 2022 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Net Sales $ 1,536.6 $ 1,361.2 $ 459.5 $ 3,357.3 Operating Earnings  $ 15.1 $ 146.5 $ 44.6 $ 206.2 Inventory adjustment relating to exit activities 0.2 2.4 — 2.6 Restructuring and other exit charges 2.8 17.1 (1.1 ) 18.8 Impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles 0.5 0.7 — 1.2 Loss on assets held for sale — 3.0 — 3.0 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 23.6 — 1.8 25.4 Other 5.1 1.0 0.3 6.4 Adjusted Operating Earnings  $ 47.3 $ 170.7 $ 45.6 $ 263.6\n\nTwelve months ended ($ millions) March 31, 2021 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Net Sales $ 1,380.2 $ 1,163.8 $ 433.9 $ 2,977.9 Operating Earnings  $ 63.8 $ 106.7 $ 45.9 $ 216.4 Restructuring and other exit charges 3.1 36.9 0.4 40.4 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 23.5 — 1.8 25.3 Acquisition activity expense 0.2 — 0.1 0.3 Other 1.5 0.3 — 1.8 Adjusted Operating Earnings  $ 92.1 $ 143.9 $ 48.2 $ 284.2\n\nIncrease (Decrease) over prior year Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Net Sales 11.3 % 17.0 % 5.9 % 12.7 % Operating Earnings (76.3 ) 37.4 (2.7 ) (4.7 ) Adjusted Operating Earnings (48.8 ) 18.8 (5.2 ) (7.2 )\n\nReconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures \r\n(Unaudited)\n\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of Net Earnings to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n\nQuarter ended  Twelve months ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 Net Earnings $ 28.1 $ 33.8 $ 143.9 $ 143.3 Depreciation 15.3 15.8 62.6 60.9 Amortization 8.2 8.1 33.2 33.4 Interest 9.4 9.1 37.8 38.5 Income Taxes 10.8 9.4 30.0 26.8 EBITDA 71.8 76.2 307.5 302.9 Non-GAAP adjustments 16.0 20.7 32.0 42.5 Adjusted EBITDA $ 87.8 $ 96.9 $ 339.5 $ 345.4\n\nThe following table provides the non-GAAP adjustments shown in the reconciliation above:\n\nQuarter ended  Twelve months ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 Inventory adjustment relating to exit activities $ 1.6 $ 0.0 $ 2.6 $ — Restructuring and other exit charges 5.6 20.7 18.8 40.4 Impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles 1.2 — 1.2 — Loss on assets held for sale 3.0 — 3.0 — Acquisition activity expense — — — 0.3 Other 4.6 — 6.4 1.8 Non-GAAP adjustments $ 16.0 $ 20.7 $ 32.0 $ 42.5\n\nIncluded below is a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted Net earnings to reported amounts.

Demand across all segments continued to surge, with fourth quarter net sales of $907 million eclipsing $900 million for the first time in our company’s history and our backlog growing to $1.3 billion, breaking new records for the third consecutive quarter. Our pricing actions are continuing to catch up with our significant cost increases, driving a 19% sequential increase in adjusted diluted EPS despite ongoing and mounting supply chain headwinds, labor shortages, and historic inflation levels. While pricing has not yet caught up with the persisting inflation endured this fiscal year, we are pleased with the trajectory our teams are making to recapture our underlying financial potential. For reference, the inflation and supply chain disruptions created nearly $3 per share of sequential pressure in fiscal 2022. Approximately two-thirds of this pressure was offset in the fiscal year as we continue to chase these pressures with price and mix.\n\nWe achieved several key milestones in fiscal 2022, including the launch and UL safety listing of our high-performance NexSys® lithium iON batteries which feature an integrated Battery Management System (BMS) that performs auto-diagnosis, voltage limitation, and communication of performance data. We also exceeded our capacity goal for our Thin Plate Pure Lead (TPPL) batteries. Customer demand for this proprietary technology across all of our business segments continues to outpace our ability to supply. We expect to benefit further from the strength of this demand as we make progress toward increasing capacity by an additional $200 million in fiscal 2023. I am also pleased to note we made significant progress on our ESG goals, including several sustainability and environment updates that culminated in the publication of our first comprehensive sustainability report in April 2022. The report highlights the critical role our power and energy solutions play in building a resilient, low-carbon future and are a key component to decarbonization globally.\n\nAs we enter fiscal 2023, we expect to face ongoing challenges with continued supply chain constraints and inflation exacerbated by the senseless conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the resurgence of Covid in China. We remain focused on what is in our control, catching inflation with ongoing price increases, navigating supply disruptions, and improving manufacturing cost performance. I am proud of our employees’ resilience and proven ability to address these challenges head on. Despite these near-term headwinds, we are optimistic about our ability to persevere and capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us. We believe we are well positioned for accelerated growth once the current macro headwinds subside. We are committed to being good corporate citizens and delivering long-term value to our shareholders through profitable growth and a disciplined capital allocation strategy.\n\nDavid M. Shaffer, President and Chief Executive Officer, EnerSys\n\nSummary of Results\n\nFourth Quarter 2022\n\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 were $907.0 million, an increase of 11.5% from the prior year fourth quarter net sales of $813.5 million and increased 7.5% sequentially from the third quarter of fiscal 2022 net sales of $844.0 million. The increase compared to prior year quarter was the result of an 8% increase in organic volume resulting primarily from strong demand arising from robust markets and the easing of the pandemic and a 6% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. The sequential increase was due to a 6% increase in organic volume and a 2% increase in pricing.\n\nNet earnings attributable to EnerSys stockholders (“Net earnings”) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $28.1 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $22.0 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nNet earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was $33.8 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $22.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nExcluding these highlighted items, adjusted Net earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, on a non-GAAP basis, were $1.20, compared to the guidance of $1.11 to $1.21 per diluted share for the fourth quarter given by the Company on February 9, 2022. These earnings compare to the prior year fourth quarter adjusted Net earnings of $1.30 per diluted share. Please refer to the section included herein under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the Company’s use of non-GAAP adjusted financial information, which includes tables reconciling GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021.\n\nSummary of Results\n\nFiscal Year 2022\n\nNet sales for the twelve months of fiscal 2022 were $3,357.3 million, an increase of 12.7% from the prior year twelve months net sales of $2,977.9 million. This increase was due to a 10% increase in organic volume resulting primarily from strong demand and a 3% increase in pricing.\n\nNet earnings for the twelve months of fiscal 2022 was $143.9 million, or $3.36 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $47.1 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nNet earnings for the twelve months of fiscal 2021 was $143.3 million, or $3.32 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $50.8 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nAdjusted Net earnings per diluted share for the twelve months of fiscal 2022, on a non-GAAP basis, were $4.47. This compares to the prior year twelve months adjusted Net earnings of $4.49 per diluted share. Please refer to the section included herein under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the Company’s use of non-GAAP adjusted financial information.\n\nFirst Quarter 2023 Outlook\n\nMacro headwinds from supply chain constraints, increasing interest rates and increased inflationary challenges have only been fueled by geopolitical events of the past quarter, and we anticipate these will not dramatically subside this calendar year. We will continue to take necessary pricing actions and expect to see ongoing mix benefits of our product redesign and re-sourcing efforts continuing throughout the year. We remain well-positioned to capitalize heavily on robust market demand in exciting end-markets, our strong order book, and price stickiness once the current macro environment normalizes, and we are tracking to our strategic plan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.10 to $1.20, with our pricing keeping pace with mounting inflation and FX gains in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 not repeating. We expect our gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to be in the range of 21% - 23%. For the full year of fiscal 2023 we expect capital expenditure to be approximately $100 million.\n\nConference Call and Webcast Details\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results at 9:00 AM (EST) Thursday, May 26, 2022.

EnerSys' management uses the non-GAAP measures “adjusted Net earnings”, “adjusted Diluted EPS”, “adjusted operating earnings” and “adjusted EBITDA” as applicable, in their analysis of the Company's performance. Adjusted Net earnings and adjusted operating earnings measure, as used by EnerSys in past quarters and years, adjusts Net earnings and operating earnings determined in accordance with GAAP to reflect changes in financial results associated with the Company's restructuring initiatives and other highlighted charges and income items. Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure as an overall assessment of our performance, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and for business planning purposes. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest income, interest expense, other (income) expense net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude restructuring and exit activities, impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and other assets, acquisition activities and those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance. EBITDA is calculated as net income before interest income, interest expense, other (income) expense net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management believes the presentation of these financial measures reflecting these non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results and overall business performance; in particular, those charges that the Company incurs as a result of restructuring activities, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and other assets, acquisition activities and those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, such as significant legal proceedings, amortization of Alpha and NorthStar related intangible assets and tax valuation allowance changes, including those related to the AHV (Old-Age and Survivors Insurance) Financing (TRAF) in Switzerland. Because these charges are not incurred as a result of ongoing operations, or are incurred as a result of a potential or previous acquisition, they are not as helpful a measure of the performance of our underlying business, particularly in light of their unpredictable nature and are difficult to forecast. Although we exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles from these non-GAAP measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.\n\nIncome tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated using the applicable statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the charges (benefits) are incurred, while taking into consideration any valuation allowances. For those items which are non-taxable, the tax expense (benefit) is calculated at 0%.\n\nThese non-GAAP disclosures have limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for operating earnings, Net earnings or net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Management believes that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding the Company's ongoing operating results. This supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to Net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted operating earnings is set forth in the table below, providing a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted operating earnings to the Company’s reported operating results for its business segments.\n\nBusiness Segment Operating Results\n\nQuarter ended ($ millions) March 31, 2022 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty TotalNet Sales$410.4  $364.9  $131.7  $907.0  Operating Earnings $4.7  $29.8  $10.0  $44.5 Inventory adjustment relating to exit activities 0.2   1.4   —   1.6 Restructuring and other exit charges 1.4   4.2   —   5.6 Impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles 0.5   0.7   —   1.2 Loss on assets held for sale —   3.0   —   3.0 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 5.8   —   0.5   6.3 Other 3.3   1.0   0.3   4.6 Adjusted Operating Earnings $15.9  $40.1  $10.8  $66.8\n\nQuarter ended ($ millions) March 31, 2021 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty TotalNet Sales$348.8  $332.8  $131.9  $813.5  Operating Earnings $3.1  $31.9  $16.7  $51.7 Restructuring and other exit charges 0.5   20.0   0.2   20.7 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 5.5   —   0.5   6.0 Adjusted Operating Earnings $9.1  $51.9  $17.4  $78.4\n\nIncrease (Decrease) % from prior year quarterEnergy Systems Motive Power Specialty TotalNet Sales17.6% 9.7% (0.2)% 11.5%Operating Earnings51.4  (6.4) (40.2) (13.9)Adjusted Operating Earnings74.0  (22.7) (38.0) (14.8)\n\nTwelve months ended ($ millions) March 31, 2022 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty TotalNet Sales$1,536.6  $1,361.2  $459.5  $3,357.3  Operating Earnings $15.1  $146.5  $44.6  $206.2 Inventory adjustment relating to exit activities 0.2   2.4   —   2.6 Restructuring and other exit charges 2.8   17.1   (1.1)  18.8 Impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles 0.5   0.7   —   1.2 Loss on assets held for sale —   3.0   —   3.0 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 23.6   —   1.8   25.4 Other 5.1   1.0   0.3   6.4 Adjusted Operating Earnings $47.3  $170.7  $45.6  $263.6\n\nTwelve months ended ($ millions) March 31, 2021 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty TotalNet Sales$1,380.2  $1,163.8  $433.9  $2,977.9  Operating Earnings $63.8  $106.7  $45.9  $216.4 Restructuring and other exit charges 3.1   36.9   0.4   40.4 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 23.5   —   1.8   25.3 Acquisition activity expense 0.2   —   0.1   0.3 Other 1.5   0.3   —   1.8 Adjusted Operating Earnings $92.1  $143.9  $48.2  $284.2\n\nIncrease (Decrease) over prior yearEnergy Systems Motive Power Specialty TotalNet Sales11.3% 17.0% 5.9% 12.7%Operating Earnings(76.3) 37.4  (2.7) (4.7)Adjusted Operating Earnings(48.8) 18.8  (5.2) (7.2)\n\nReconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures \r\n(Unaudited)\n\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of Net Earnings to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n\nQuarter ended  Twelve months ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021Net Earnings$28.1  $33.8  $143.9  $143.3 Depreciation 15.3   15.8   62.6   60.9 Amortization 8.2   8.1   33.2   33.4 Interest 9.4   9.1   37.8   38.5 Income Taxes 10.8   9.4   30.0   26.8 EBITDA 71.8   76.2   307.5   302.9 Non-GAAP adjustments 16.0   20.7   32.0   42.5 Adjusted EBITDA$87.8  $96.9  $339.5  $345.4\n\nThe following table provides the non-GAAP adjustments shown in the reconciliation above:\n\nQuarter ended  Twelve months ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021Inventory adjustment relating to exit activities$1.6  $0.0  $2.6  $— Restructuring and other exit charges 5.6   20.7   18.8   40.4 Impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles 1.2   —   1.2   — Loss on assets held for sale 3.0   —   3.0   — Acquisition activity expense —   —   —   0.3 Other 4.6   —   6.4   1.8 Non-GAAP adjustments$16.0  $20.7  $32.0  $42.5\n\nIncluded below is a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted Net earnings to reported amounts.

"2022-05-24T18:47:06+00:00","EnerSys (ENS) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?","EnerSys ENS is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended March 2022) results on May 25, after market close.\r\n\r\nENS’ earnings surpassed estimates thrice in the last four quarters and missed the mark once, the surprise being 0.8%, on average. Its third-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended December 2021) earnings of $1.01 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents by 2%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn the past three months, shares of the company have lost 11.5% compared with the industry’s decline of 10.3%.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nEnerSys’ results for the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to have been affected by the softness in its power systems end market amid the supply-chain constraints. Also, weakness in ENS’s original equipment manufacturer (OEM) motive power end market is expected to have been a headwind in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nENS has been dealing with the adverse impacts of increasing cost of sales and operating expenses for a while. In the fiscal third quarter, its cost of sales increased 17.4% year over year, while Operating expenses jumped 10.8%, a trend that most likely continued in the fiscal fourth quarter. Also, in the quarter, ENS’s gross margin decreased 340 basis points (bps) while the operating margin fell 330 bps. Shortages of product components (semiconductors and resin) as well as high freight and tariffs plus labor constraints might have dented EnerSys’ margin and profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\r\n\r\nEnerSys has been making multiple investments to boost growth over time. Although its investments bode well for the long term, high capital expenditure incurred might have suppressed its short-term liquidity in the to-be-reported quarter. For fiscal 2022, ENS expects capital expenditure of about $100 million, of which $52.4 million was incurred in the first three quarters of fiscal 2022.\r\n\r\nENS’s performance is exposed to risks arising from geopolitical issues, trade relations, unfavorable movements in foreign currencies and governmental policies, given its widespread presence. A stronger U.S. dollar might have hurt its overseas business in the fiscal fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, EnerSys is expected to have benefited from strength across defense, transportation and lithium-based battery technology end markets in the fiscal fourth quarter. Also, ENS’ solid product offerings, its focus on product innovation (including lithium, Touch-Safe and DC fast charge) and strengthening demand are expected to have positively contributed to its performance in the fiscal fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter from the Energy Systems segment is currently pegged at $387 million, indicating growth of 10.9% from the last fiscal year’s quarterly reported figure. Also, the consensus estimate for Motive Power segment revenues is pegged at $369 million, indicating an increase of 10.8% from the last fiscal year’s quarterly reading.

"2022-05-20T12:15:12+00:00","Deere (DE) Q2 Earnings Top Estimates","Deere (DE) came out with quarterly earnings of $6.81 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.65 per share. This compares to earnings of $5.68 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.41%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this agricultural equipment manufacturer would post earnings of $2.28 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.92, delivering a surprise of 28.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nDeere , which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry, posted revenues of $12.03 billion for the quarter ended April 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.48%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $11 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nDeere shares have added about 6.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -18.2%.\n\nWhat's Next for Deere?\n\nWhile Deere has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Deere: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $6.92 on $12.83 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $22.69 on $47.58 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Manufacturing - Farm Equipment is currently in the bottom 22% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, EnerSys (ENS), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2022. The results are expected to be released on May 25.\n\nThis maker of industrial batteries is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -11.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nEnerSys' revenues are expected to be $881.25 million, up 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"2022-05-18T19:00:07+00:00","Earnings Preview: EnerSys (ENS) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline","The market expects EnerSys (ENS) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis maker of industrial batteries is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -11.5%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $881.25 million, up 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.43% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nPrice, Consensus and EPS Surprise Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for ENS\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for EnerSys?\n\nFor EnerSys, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.31%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that EnerSys will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that EnerSys would post earnings of $0.99 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.01, delivering a surprise of +2.02%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nEnerSys doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nFranklin Electric shares have lost about 15.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -9.9%.\n\nWhat's Next for Franklin Electric?\n\nWhile Franklin Electric has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Franklin Electric: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.07 on $526.9 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.66 on $1.97 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Manufacturing - Electronics is currently in the bottom 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nEnerSys (ENS), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2022.\n\nThis maker of industrial batteries is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -11.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nEnerSys' revenues are expected to be $883 million, up 8.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"2022-04-08T13:46:01+00:00","Here's Why it is Worth Investing in EnerSys (ENS) Stock Now","EnerSys ENS currently boasts robust prospects on strength in its end markets, solid product portfolio, acquired assets and a sound capital-deployment strategy. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has a market capitalization of about $3 billion. In the past month, it has gained 0.7% against the industry’s decline of 2.3%.\r\n\r\nLet’s delve into the factors that make investment in the company a smart choice at the moment.\r\n\r\nBusiness Strength: EnerSys has been benefiting from its presence across diversified end markets, which enables it to neutralize risks across one end market with strength across others.

Also, the company stands to gain from favorable trends, including rural broadband, home energy storage, 5G buildout and EV charging, in the long run.\r\n\r\nStrong Backlog Level: ENS’ strong product offerings, focus on product innovation, technological expertise and effective pricing bode well.

"2022-04-04T15:40:03+00:00","ENS or ZWS: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?","Investors looking for stocks in the Manufacturing - Electronics sector might want to consider either EnerSys (ENS) or Zurn Water (ZWS). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nRight now, both EnerSys and Zurn Water are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nENS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.10, while ZWS has a forward P/E of 32.24. We also note that ENS has a PEG ratio of 1.41. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ZWS currently has a PEG ratio of 1.61.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for ENS is its P/B ratio of 2.12. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ZWS has a P/B of 34.36.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to ENS's Value grade of B and ZWS's Value grade of D.\n\nBoth ENS and ZWS are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that ENS is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"2022-03-21T16:37:13+00:00","3 Battery Stocks That Pay Dividends. Are They a Buy?","Battery stocks have come into focus as the industry segment has been growing at a rapid clip, and demand is only rising as they become increasingly popular in electric vehicles, cloud computing, charging devices, and other sectors.\n\nEnergy research firm Wood Mackenzie earlier this month noted that battery storage is fundamental to “a radical energy transition” that is now underway, “driven by environmental, policy and technology factors.” The EV sector, in particular, has been perhaps the biggest growth driver for battery stocks, with the market expected to be worth over $192 billion by 2030. Hence, battery stocks can easily become one of the most lucrative investment options as we progress toward a fully “renewable” economy.\n\nFinding battery stocks that pay dividends can be an uphill climb. Technology companies are notorious for not paying dividends as they reinvest whatever earnings they generate into the company. Moreover, a vast majority of them are still chalking out their path to profitability. Therefore, it’s virtually impossible for these companies to milk dividends from their cash flows.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n9 Gold Stocks to Buy as Global Fears Rise\n\nHowever, after careful deliberation, here’s a list of some of the top battery stocks which happen to pay dividends.\n\nAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) FMC Corp (NYSE:FMC) EnerSys (NYSE:ENS)\n\nBoth Albemarle and EnerSys are among the top 20 holdings in the new WisdomTree Battery Value Chain and Innovation Fund (BATS:WBAT). ENS (3.41%) is the fourth-largest among the 89 stocks in the exchange-traded fund’s portfolio, while ALB (2.02%) is 17th. Battery stocks price chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nBattery Stocks To Buy: Albemarle (ALB)  Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle is a material and specialty chemicals specialist based out of North Carolina.With a focus on EV-related materials and lithium, the company intends to significantly expand its output to cater to the rising demand for its products.\n\nStory continues\n\nLithium demand will continue driving its business to new heights. It recently bumped its forecast for the lithium market by an incredible 30%. Consequently, it also increases its conversion capacity to meet the accelerating demand.\n\nConsidering the supply chain constrictions, the company’s performance has been relatively impressive. It recently posted a healthy earnings beat which points to a better time as we advance. More importantly, its dividend profile is attractive considering its safety and consistency. Also, it recently increased its quarterly dividend by 1% to 39.5 cents.\n\nFMC Corp (FMC)  FMC logo on the website homepage FMC stock\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nFMC is one of the top agrochemical companies globally, boasting a spectacular profitability profile. FMC had separated its battery business back in 2018 into a publicly traded company called Livent Corporation.\n\nLivent is a fully integrated lithium manufacturer with a vast portfolio of products for EVs, energy storage applications, polymers, and specialty uses. For the past several quarters, the company has been an incredible performer, and its operations show consistent profits and cash flow yields.\n\nBeing a one-stop shop for lithium enables the company to tap into private markets and command higher pricing. Therefore, its profitability is firmly in the green, and the business has arguably the biggest upside for any lithium investment.\n\n7 Stable Energy Stocks for Uncertain Times\n\nFMC stock has performed well over six months, with over a 30% return. Furthermore, its dividend profile is impressive, with a 1.7% forward yield and growth rates in excess of 28%. Hence, it’s one of the most attractive investments in its sector.\n\nBattery Stocks to Buy: EnerSys (ENS) electric car concept running on the road\n\nSource: Ju Jae-young / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnerSys is the leading industrial battery manufacturer globally. It delivers its solution to various sectors, including aerospace, transport, medical devices, telecommunications, and others. Additionally, it has incredible growth opportunities in 5G and the EV realm.\n\nThe company has performed decently in terms of financials and will be looking to push the pace in the coming years. Also, its acquisitions are expanding its revenue base, and the benefits of its merger and acquisition activities should bear fruit for years to come.\n\nEnersys planned to expand its revenue growth by 50% over four years. Moreover, it expects to significantly expand its cash flows which should feed its dividend profile. Though its dividend yield is lower than 1%, it has a solid foundation to take it to the next level.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

"2022-03-11T16:30:04+00:00","EnerSys (ENS) Up 2.1% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?","It has been about a month since the last earnings report for EnerSys (ENS). Shares have added about 2.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is EnerSys due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nEnerSys Tops on Q3 Earnings, Expects Q/Q Growth for Q4\n\nEnerSys reported better-than-expected results for third-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Jan 2, 2022). The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.02% and its sales beat the same by 3.74%.\r\n\r\nENS’ earnings in the quarter under review were $1.01 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents. However, the bottom line declined 20.5% from the year-ago figure of $1.27 as higher costs and expenses more than offset the positive impacts of revenue growth.\n\nRevenue Details\n\nIn the quarter under review, EnerSys’ revenues were $844 million, reflecting an increase of 12.4% from the year-ago quarter. Organic sales in the quarter grew 10% on the back of strengthening markets. Pricing positively impacted sales by 3% and forex woes left a negative impact of 1%.\r\n\r\nOn a sequential basis, the company’s revenues increased 6.7%.\r\n\r\nExiting the reported quarter, the company had a backlog of $1.2 billion.\r\n\r\nThe company’s revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $814 million.\r\n\r\nGeographically, ENS' net sales increased 16% year over year to $578 million in the Americas, while the metric witnessed growth of 5% to $203 million in Europe, Middle East and Africa. Sales in Asia were $63 million, reflecting an increase of 8% from the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nIts segmental performance for the fiscal third quarter is briefly discussed below:\r\n\r\nEnergy Systems' sales were $385.2 million, increasing 14.2% year over year. Volume was up 14% and pricing had a positive impact of 1%. Foreign currency translations hurt by 1%.\r\n\r\nThe Motive Power segment generated revenues of $339.5 million, increasing 11.5% year over year. The quarterly results benefited from 9% growth in volumes and a 5% positive contribution from pricing. Forex woes left a negative impact of 2%.\r\n\r\nSpecialty's sales were $119.3 million, increasing 8.9% year over year. Volumes grew 3% in the quarter, while pricing had positive impacts of 6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMargin Profile\n\nIn the reported quarter, EnerSys' cost of sales increased 17.4% year over year to $659.7 million. The cost of sales was 78.2% of the quarter's net sales. The gross profit in the quarter decreased 2.6% year over year to $184.3 million, while the gross margin fell 340 basis points (bps) year over year to 21.8%.\r\n\r\nOperating expenses increased 10.8% year over year to $130.7 million. It represented 15.5% of net sales in the reported quarter versus 15.7% in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating earnings were $60.3 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 23.1%. Margin decreased 330 bps year over year to 7.1%.\r\n\r\nThe company's performance in the quarter suffered from cost inflation and supply-chain constraints. However, pricing actions were a relief.\n\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\n\nExiting the third quarter of fiscal 2022, EnerSys had cash and cash equivalents of $397.1 million, down 2.6% from $407.5 million recorded in the last reported quarter. Long-term debt increased 10.7% sequentially to $1,194.5 million.\r\n\r\nIn the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, the company repaid a term loan of $161.4 million and revolving credit borrowings of $39.8 million. However, proceeds for revolving credit borrowings were $424.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2022.\r\n\r\nThe company used net cash of $78 million for its operating activities in the first three quarters of fiscal 2022 against net cash generation of $272.1 million in the year-ago period. Capital expenditure totaled $52.4 million compared with $53.7 million in the prior-year period.\r\n\r\nEnerSys rewarded shareholders with a dividend payout of $22.2 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2022. Share repurchased amounted to $114.5 million. The company is left to buyback shares worth $42 million.\n\nOutlook\n\nEnerSys anticipates gaining from health demand, effective pricing and technological expertise in the quarters ahead. Cost inflation is worrisome. Earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter are expected to be $1.11-$1.21 per share.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, EnerSys has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, EnerSys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"2022-03-10T14:51:02+00:00","EnerSys (ENS) Authorizes $150M Share Repurchase Program","EnerSys ENS yesterday announced rewards for shareholders in the form of share buyback authorization. We believe that the repurchase program is in sync with its commitment to rewarding shareholders handsomely.\r\n\r\nThe company’s shares gained 4.8% yesterday to eventually close the trading session at $71.04.\n\nDetails on Share Buyback Program\n\nUnder the aforementioned buyback program, EnerSys has been authorized by its board of directors to repurchase shares worth $150 million. The buyback can be carried out in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions and other factors. The buyback program is applicable with no expiration date.\r\n\r\nWith the new share repurchase authorization, the company is left to repurchase shares worth $181 million in aggregate, including $31 million available under its previously approved share buyback program.\n\nSound Capital Allocation Strategies\n\nEnerSys follows sound capital allocation strategies, aiming to improve values for shareholders.

This new authorization brings the Company’s total outstanding repurchase authorization to an aggregate of $181 million, including $31 million available under the Board’s previous repurchase authorization approved on November 4, 2021. In fiscal year 2022 to date, the Company has repurchased $159 million in shares.\n\nThe Company estimates an additional $30 million to become available on April 1, 2022, as part of its evergreen stock buyback authorization designed to offset dilution related to its equity-based award program.

"2022-02-13T11:26:44+00:00","EnerSys (NYSE:ENS) Has Affirmed Its Dividend Of US$0.17","The board of EnerSys (NYSE:ENS) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 25th of March, with investors receiving US$0.17 per share. This means the annual payment will be 1.0% of the current stock price, which is lower than the industry average.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for EnerSys\n\nEnerSys' Earnings Easily Cover the Distributions\n\nIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. EnerSys is quite easily earning enough to cover the dividend, however it is being let down by weak cash flows. We think that cash flows should take priority over earnings, so this is definitely a worry for the dividend going forward.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 36.4% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 14% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range. historic-dividend\n\nEnerSys Is Still Building Its Track Record\n\nThe dividend's track record has been pretty solid, but with only 9 years of history we want to see a few more years of history before making any solid conclusions. Since 2013, the first annual payment was US$0.50, compared to the most recent full-year payment of US$0.70. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 3.8% over that duration. It's good to see at least some dividend growth. Yet with a relatively short dividend paying history, we wouldn't want to depend on this dividend too heavily.\n\nThe Dividend's Growth Prospects Are Limited\n\nInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. However, EnerSys has only grown its earnings per share at 3.0% per annum over the past five years. While growth may be thin on the ground, EnerSys could always pay out a higher proportion of earnings to increase shareholder returns.\n\nIn Summary\n\nIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about EnerSys' payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While the low payout ratio is redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. To that end, EnerSys has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is potentially serious) we think you should know about. We have also put together a list of global stocks with a solid dividend.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

"2022-02-11T14:41:02+00:00","EnerSys (ENS) Tops on Q3 Earnings, Expects Q/Q Growth for Q4","EnerSys ENS reported better-than-expected results for third-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Jan 2, 2022). The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.02% and sales beat the same by 3.74%.\r\n\r\nENS’ earnings in the quarter under review were $1.01 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents. However, the bottom line declined 20.5% from the year-ago figure of $1.27 as higher costs and expenses more than offset the positive impacts of revenue growth.\n\nRevenue Details\n\nIn the quarter under review, EnerSys’ revenues were $844 million, reflecting an increase of 12.4% from the year-ago quarter. Organic sales in the quarter grew 10% on the back of strengthening markets. Pricing positively impacted sales by 3% and forex woes left a negative impact of 1%.\r\n\r\nOn a sequential basis, the company’s revenues increased 6.7%.\r\n\r\nExiting the reported quarter, the company had a backlog of $1.2 billion.\r\n\r\nThe company’s revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $814 million.\r\n\r\nGeographically, ENS' net sales increased 16% year over year to $578 million in the Americas, while the metric witnessed growth of 5% to $203 million in Europe, Middle East and Africa. Sales in Asia were $63 million, reflecting an increase of 8% from the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nIts segmental performance for the fiscal third quarter is briefly discussed below:\r\n\r\nEnergy Systems' sales were $385.2 million, contributing 45.6% to net revenues in the quarter under review. On a year-over-year basis, the segment's revenues increased 14.2%. Volume was up 14% and pricing had a positive impact of 1%. Foreign currency translations hurt by 1%.\r\n\r\nThe Motive Power segment generated revenues of $339.5 million, contributing 40.2% to net revenues in the reported quarter. The figure increased 11.5% year over year based on 9% growth in volumes and a 5% positive contribution from pricing. Forex woes left a negative impact of 2%.\r\n\r\nSpecialty's sales were $119.3 million, contributing14.2% to net revenues in the quarter under review. On a year-over-year basis, the segment's revenues increased 8.9%. Volumes grew3% in the quarter, while pricing had positive impacts of 6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMargin Profile\n\nIn the reported quarter, EnerSys' cost of sales increased 17.4% year over year to $659.7 million. The cost of sales was 78.2% of the quarter's net sales. The gross profit in the quarter decreased 2.6% year over year to $184.3 million, while the gross margin fell 340 basis points (bps) year over year to 21.8%.\r\n\r\nOperating expenses increased 10.8% year over year to $130.7 million. It represented 15.5% of net sales in the reported quarter versus 15.7% in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating earnings were $60.3 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 23.1%. Margin decreased 330 bps year over year to 7.1%.\r\n\r\nThe company's performance in the quarter suffered from cost inflation and supply-chain constraints. However, pricing actions were a relief.\n\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\n\nExiting the third quarter of fiscal 2022, EnerSys had cash and cash equivalents of $397.1 million, down 2.6% from $407.5 million recorded in the last reported quarter. Long-term debt increased 10.7% sequentially to $1,194.5 million.\r\n\r\nIn the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, the company repaid a term loan of $161.4 million and revolving credit borrowings of $39.8 million. However, proceeds for revolving credit borrowings were $424.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2022.\r\n\r\nThe company used net cash of $78 million for its operating activities in the first three quarters of fiscal 2022 against net cash generation of $272.1 million in the year-ago period. Capital expenditure totaled $52.4 million compared with $53.7 million in the prior-year period.\r\n\r\nEnerSys rewarded shareholders with a dividend payout of $22.2 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2022.

The company is left to buyback shares worth $42 million.\r\n\r\nConcurrently, EnerSys’ board of directors approved the payment of a quarterly cash dividend of 17.5 cents per share to shareholders of record as of Mar 11, 2022. The disbursement will be made on Mar 25, 2022.\n\nOutlook\n\nEnerSys anticipates gaining from health demand, effective pricing and technological expertise in the quarters ahead. Cost inflation is worrisome. Earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter are expected to be $1.11-$1.21 per share.\n\nEnersys Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Enersys Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nEnersys price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Enersys Quote\n\nZacks Rank & Other Important Earnings Releases\n\nWith a market capitalization of $3.1 billion, EnerSys currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nThree companies from the Zacks Industrial Products sector to soon report results are discussed below:\r\n\r\n Ingersoll Rand Inc.

"2022-02-10T00:05:12+00:00","EnerSys (ENS) Beats Q3 Earnings and Revenue Estimates","EnerSys (ENS) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.01 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.99 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.27 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.02%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of industrial batteries would post earnings of $1.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.01, delivering a surprise of -4.72%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nEnerSys , which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, posted revenues of $844 million for the quarter ended December 2021, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.74%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $751.1 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nEnerSys shares have lost about 6.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -5.1%.\n\nWhat's Next for EnerSys?\n\nWhile EnerSys has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for EnerSys: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.22 on $855.75 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.46 on $3.28 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Manufacturing - Electronics is currently in the top 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

"2022-02-09T21:15:00+00:00","EnerSys Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Results","READING, Pa., Feb. 09, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EnerSys (NYSE: ENS), the global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications, announced today results for its third quarter of fiscal 2022, which ended on January 2, 2022.\n\nThird Quarter FY 22 Highlights\n\nKey Results from Operations by Segments ($ in millions) Q3 FY22 Q3 FY21 % Change Energy Systems Net Sales $ 385.2 $ 337.2 14.2 % Operating Earnings  3.5 18.5 (80.8 ) Adjusted Operating Earnings * 9.8 24.8 (60.3 ) Motive Power Net Sales 339.5 304.4 11.5 Operating Earnings 39.0 40.2 (3.1 ) Adjusted Operating Earnings * 39.0 40.5 (3.6 ) Specialty Net Sales 119.3 109.5 9.0 Operating Earnings 11.1 12.6 (12.1 ) Adjusted Operating Earnings * 11.5 13.1 (11.9 )\n\n* This is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information.\n\nMessage from the CEO\n\nWe achieved the midpoint of our Q3 guidance on 10% organic volume growth and aggressive price actions that offset cost increases. Revenue in the quarter was well above pre-COVID levels, up 12% over Q3’21 and 11% above Q3’20, despite the full potential being suppressed by lingering supply chain disruptions. Our order rates are very strong, with our backlog growing to a record $1.2B, 2x normalized levels. While sequential costs spiked in excess of $30M in Q3, over $0.50 / share and our largest quarterly increase, I am pleased to say that our aggressive pricing actions are catching up, as our 3% sequential price / mix improvement offset this quarter’s immense inflationary impact.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q3, we published our EnerSys Sustainability Update, which provided environmental baseline data. We have continued to make substantial progress on our strategic technology and business development initiatives including 5G powering, transportation market share, and next generation Motive Power products, which collectively account for the majority of our backlog growth. Our lithium technology continues to gain traction as we now have several lithium variants available to Motive Power and Energy Systems, we released our Outback Mojave home energy storage lithium battery system, and $46 million of the $117 million of Energy Systems orders so far received for the California Public Utilities Commission backup power mandate were for lithium batteries. Demand is robust across all of our lines of businesses, and we expect this strength to continue well into our next fiscal year. Motive Power order rates have returned to normalized levels and the business will benefit as forklift electrification efforts continue, shortages abate, and we work down our backlog. Energy Systems margin improvements through pricing, contract manufacturing on-shoring, product redesign, and volume will continue to accelerate over the upcoming quarters with further demand growth in network powering. Finally, Specialty’s significant growth in Q3 was actually stymied by supply shortages which should set the business up for an even stronger Q4.\n\nAs such, we anticipate the benefit of our robust demand, pricing actions, technology developments, and supply mitigation strategies to show continued improvement over the upcoming quarters. We bought back 1.5M shares for $116M since the beginning of Q3, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to 1.9M shares for $148M and have $42M left in authorizations. We expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $1.11 and $1.21 in our fourth fiscal quarter.\n\nDavid M. Shaffer, President and Chief Executive Officer, EnerSys\n\nNet earnings attributable to EnerSys stockholders (“Net earnings”) for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $36.3 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $6.7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nNet earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was $38.6 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $16.4 million, or $0.38 per diluted share from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nExcluding these highlighted items, adjusted Net earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, on a non-GAAP basis, were $1.01, compared to the guidance of $0.96 to $1.06 per diluted share for the third quarter given by the Company on November 10, 2021. These earnings compare to the prior year third quarter adjusted Net earnings of $1.27 per diluted share. Please refer to the section included herein under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the Company’s use of non-GAAP adjusted financial information, which includes tables reconciling GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for the quarters ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021.\n\nNet sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 were $844.0 million, an increase of 12.4% from the prior year third quarter net sales of $751.1 million and increased 6.7% sequentially from the second quarter of fiscal 2022 net sales of $791.4 million. The increase compared to prior year quarter was the result of a 10% increase in organic volume resulting primarily from strong demand arising from robust markets and the easing of the pandemic and a 3% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 1% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. The sequential increase was due to a 5% increase in organic volume and a 3% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 1% decrease in foreign currency translation impact.\n\nThe Company’s operating results for its business segments for the third quarters of fiscal 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n\nQuarter ended ($ millions) January 2, 2022 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Net Sales $ 385.2 $ 339.5 $ 119.3 $ 844.0 Operating Earnings  $ 2.8 $ 37.3 $ 11.0 $ 51.1 Restructuring and other exit charges 0.7 1.7 0.1 2.5 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 5.9 — 0.4 6.3 Other 0.4 — — 0.4 Adjusted Operating Earnings  $ 9.8 $ 39.0 $ 11.5 $ 60.3\n\nQuarter ended ($ millions) January 3, 2021 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Net Sales $ 337.2 $ 304.4 $ 109.5 $ 751.1 Operating Earnings  $ 17.7 $ 25.8 $ 12.6 $ 56.1 Restructuring and other exit charges 0.8 14.4 — 15.2 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 6.3 — 0.5 6.8 Other — 0.3 — 0.3 Adjusted Operating Earnings  $ 24.8 $ 40.5 $ 13.1 $ 78.4\n\nNet earnings for the nine months of fiscal 2022 was $115.8 million, or $2.69 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $25.1 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nNet earnings for the nine months of fiscal 2021 was $109.5 million, or $2.54 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $28.1 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nAdjusted Net earnings per diluted share for the nine months of fiscal 2022, on a non-GAAP basis, were $3.27. This compares to the prior year nine months adjusted Net earnings of $3.19 per diluted share. Please refer to the section included herein under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the Company’s use of non-GAAP adjusted financial information.\n\nNet sales for the nine months of fiscal 2022 were $2,450.3 million, an increase of 13.2% from the prior year nine months net sales of $2,164.4 million. This increase was due to an 11% increase in organic volume resulting primarily from strong demand, and a 1% increase each in pricing and foreign currency translation impact.\n\nThe Company’s operating results for its business segments for the nine months of fiscal 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n\nNine months ended ($ millions) January 2, 2022 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Net Sales $ 1,126.2 $ 996.3 $ 327.8 $ 2,450.3 Operating Earnings  $ 10.4 $ 116.7 $ 34.6 $ 161.7 Inventory adjustment relating to exit activities — 1.0 — 1.0 Restructuring and other exit charges 1.4 12.9 (1.1 ) 13.2 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 17.8 — 1.3 19.1 Other 1.8 — — 1.8 Adjusted Operating Earnings  $ 31.4 $ 130.6 $ 34.8 $ 196.8\n\nNine months ended ($ millions) January 3, 2021 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty Total Net Sales $ 1,031.4 $ 831.0 $ 302.0 $ 2,164.4 Operating Earnings  $ 60.7 $ 74.8 $ 29.2 $ 164.7 Restructuring and other exit charges 2.6 16.9 0.2 19.7 Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 18.0 — 1.3 19.3 Other 1.5 0.3 — 1.8 Acquisition activity expense 0.2 — 0.1 0.3 Adjusted Operating Earnings  $ 83.0 $ 92.0 $ 30.8 $ 205.8\n\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, (""GAAP""). EnerSys' management uses the non-GAAP measures “adjusted Net earnings” and “adjusted operating earnings” as applicable, in their analysis of the Company's performance. This measure, as used by EnerSys in past quarters and years, adjusts operating earnings and Net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP to reflect changes in financial results associated with the Company's restructuring initiatives and other highlighted charges and income items. Management believes the presentation of these financial measures reflecting these non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results and overall business performance; in particular, those charges that the Company incurs as a result of restructuring activities, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and other assets, acquisition activities and those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, such as significant legal proceedings, amortization of Alpha and NorthStar related intangible assets and tax valuation allowance changes, including those related to the AHV Financing in Switzerland. Because these charges are not incurred as a result of ongoing operations, or are incurred as a result of a potential or previous acquisition, they are not as helpful a measure of the performance of our underlying business, particularly in light of their unpredictable nature and are difficult to forecast. Although we exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles from these non-GAAP measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.\n\nIncome tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated using the applicable statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the charges (benefits) are incurred, while taking into consideration any valuation allowances. For those items which are non-taxable, the tax expense (benefit) is calculated at 0%.\n\nThese non-GAAP disclosures have limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for operating earnings or Net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Management believes that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding the Company's ongoing operating results. This supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to Net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted operating earnings is set forth in the table above, providing a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted operating earnings to the Company’s reported operating results for its business segments. Included below is a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted Net earnings to reported amounts. Non-GAAP adjusted operating earnings and Net earnings are calculated excluding restructuring and other highlighted charges and credits.

"2022-02-09T21:15:00+00:00","EnerSys Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Results","READING, Pa., Feb.  09, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EnerSys (NYSE: ENS), the global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications, announced today results for its third quarter of fiscal 2022, which ended on January 2, 2022.\n\nThird Quarter FY 22 Highlights Record net sales of $844M up 12% vs. Q3'21Strong demand across all LoBsBacklog grew to $1.2BSupply chain slowed Q3 shipments, impacting mix / earnings  Aggressive price / mix offsetting record sequential inflationEnergy Systems margin recovery initiatives progressingContinued progress on technology, new products and on-shoring $116M share buybacks from start of Q3 through Feb 9, 2022\n\nKey Results from Operations by Segments ($ in millions)  Q3 FY22 Q3 FY21 % Change Energy Systems Net Sales $385.2 $337.2 14.2% Operating Earnings   3.5  18.5 (80.8) Adjusted Operating Earnings *  9.8  24.8 (60.3) Motive Power Net Sales  339.5  304.4 11.5 Operating Earnings  39.0  40.2 (3.1) Adjusted Operating Earnings *  39.0  40.5 (3.6) Specialty Net Sales  119.3  109.5 9.0 Operating Earnings  11.1  12.6 (12.1) Adjusted Operating Earnings *  11.5  13.1 (11.9)\n\n* This is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information.\n\nMessage from the CEO\n\nWe achieved the midpoint of our Q3 guidance on 10% organic volume growth and aggressive price actions that offset cost increases. Revenue in the quarter was well above pre-COVID levels, up 12% over Q3’21 and 11% above Q3’20, despite the full potential being suppressed by lingering supply chain disruptions. Our order rates are very strong, with our backlog growing to a record $1.2B, 2x normalized levels. While sequential costs spiked in excess of $30M in Q3, over $0.50 / share and our largest quarterly increase, I am pleased to say that our aggressive pricing actions are catching up, as our 3% sequential price / mix improvement offset this quarter’s immense inflationary impact.\n\nIn Q3, we published our EnerSys Sustainability Update, which provided environmental baseline data. We have continued to make substantial progress on our strategic technology and business development initiatives including 5G powering, transportation market share, and next generation Motive Power products, which collectively account for the majority of our backlog growth. Our lithium technology continues to gain traction as we now have several lithium variants available to Motive Power and Energy Systems, we released our Outback Mojave home energy storage lithium battery system, and $46 million of the $117 million of Energy Systems orders so far received for the California Public Utilities Commission backup power mandate were for lithium batteries. Demand is robust across all of our lines of businesses, and we expect this strength to continue well into our next fiscal year. Motive Power order rates have returned to normalized levels and the business will benefit as forklift electrification efforts continue, shortages abate, and we work down our backlog. Energy Systems margin improvements through pricing, contract manufacturing on-shoring, product redesign, and volume will continue to accelerate over the upcoming quarters with further demand growth in network powering. Finally, Specialty’s significant growth in Q3 was actually stymied by supply shortages which should set the business up for an even stronger Q4.\n\nAs such, we anticipate the benefit of our robust demand, pricing actions, technology developments, and supply mitigation strategies to show continued improvement over the upcoming quarters. We bought back 1.5M shares for $116M since the beginning of Q3, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to 1.9M shares for $148M and have $42M left in authorizations. We expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $1.11 and $1.21 in our fourth fiscal quarter.\n\nDavid M. Shaffer, President and Chief Executive Officer, EnerSys\n\nNet earnings attributable to EnerSys stockholders (“Net earnings”) for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $36.3 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $6.7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nNet earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was $38.6 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $16.4 million, or $0.38 per diluted share from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nExcluding these highlighted items, adjusted Net earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, on a non-GAAP basis, were $1.01, compared to the guidance of $0.96 to $1.06 per diluted share for the third quarter given by the Company on November 10, 2021. These earnings compare to the prior year third quarter adjusted Net earnings of $1.27 per diluted share. Please refer to the section included herein under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the Company’s use of non-GAAP adjusted financial information, which includes tables reconciling GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for the quarters ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021.\n\nNet sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 were $844.0 million, an increase of 12.4% from the prior year third quarter net sales of $751.1 million and increased 6.7% sequentially from the second quarter of fiscal 2022 net sales of $791.4 million. The increase compared to prior year quarter was the result of a 10% increase in organic volume resulting primarily from strong demand arising from robust markets and the easing of the pandemic and a 3% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 1% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. The sequential increase was due to a 5% increase in organic volume and a 3% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 1% decrease in foreign currency translation impact.\n\nThe Company’s operating results for its business segments for the third quarters of fiscal 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n\nQuarter ended ($ millions) January 2, 2022 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty TotalNet Sales$385.2 $339.5 $119.3 $844.0 Operating Earnings $2.8 $37.3 $11.0 $51.1Restructuring and other exit charges 0.7  1.7  0.1  2.5Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 5.9  —  0.4  6.3Other 0.4  —  —  0.4Adjusted Operating Earnings $9.8 $39.0 $11.5 $60.3\n\nQuarter ended ($ millions) January 3, 2021 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty TotalNet Sales$337.2 $304.4 $109.5 $751.1 Operating Earnings $17.7 $25.8 $12.6 $56.1Restructuring and other exit charges 0.8  14.4  —  15.2Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 6.3  —  0.5  6.8Other —  0.3  —  0.3Adjusted Operating Earnings $24.8 $40.5 $13.1 $78.4\n\nNet earnings for the nine months of fiscal 2022 was $115.8 million, or $2.69 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $25.1 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nNet earnings for the nine months of fiscal 2021 was $109.5 million, or $2.54 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $28.1 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts.\n\nAdjusted Net earnings per diluted share for the nine months of fiscal 2022, on a non-GAAP basis, were $3.27. This compares to the prior year nine months adjusted Net earnings of $3.19 per diluted share. Please refer to the section included herein under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the Company’s use of non-GAAP adjusted financial information.\n\nNet sales for the nine months of fiscal 2022 were $2,450.3 million, an increase of 13.2% from the prior year nine months net sales of $2,164.4 million. This increase was due to an 11% increase in organic volume resulting primarily from strong demand, and a 1% increase each in pricing and foreign currency translation impact.\n\nThe Company’s operating results for its business segments for the nine months of fiscal 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n\nNine months ended ($ millions) January 2, 2022 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty TotalNet Sales$1,126.2 $996.3 $327.8  $2,450.3 Operating Earnings $10.4 $116.7 $34.6  $161.7Inventory adjustment relating to exit activities —  1.0  —   1.0Restructuring and other exit charges 1.4  12.9  (1.1)  13.2Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 17.8  —  1.3   19.1Other 1.8  —  —   1.8Adjusted Operating Earnings $31.4 $130.6 $34.8  $196.8\n\nNine months ended ($ millions) January 3, 2021 Energy Systems Motive Power Specialty TotalNet Sales$1,031.4 $831.0 $302.0 $2,164.4 Operating Earnings $60.7 $74.8 $29.2 $164.7Restructuring and other exit charges 2.6  16.9  0.2  19.7Amortization of identified intangible assets from recent acquisitions 18.0  —  1.3  19.3Other 1.5  0.3  —  1.8Acquisition activity expense 0.2  —  0.1  0.3Adjusted Operating Earnings $83.0 $92.0 $30.8 $205.8\n\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, (""GAAP""). EnerSys' management uses the non-GAAP measures “adjusted Net earnings” and “adjusted operating earnings” as applicable, in their analysis of the Company's performance. This measure, as used by EnerSys in past quarters and years, adjusts operating earnings and Net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP to reflect changes in financial results associated with the Company's restructuring initiatives and other highlighted charges and income items. Management believes the presentation of these financial measures reflecting these non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results and overall business performance; in particular, those charges that the Company incurs as a result of restructuring activities, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and other assets, acquisition activities and those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, such as significant legal proceedings, amortization of Alpha and NorthStar related intangible assets and tax valuation allowance changes, including those related to the AHV Financing in Switzerland. Because these charges are not incurred as a result of ongoing operations, or are incurred as a result of a potential or previous acquisition, they are not as helpful a measure of the performance of our underlying business, particularly in light of their unpredictable nature and are difficult to forecast. Although we exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles from these non-GAAP measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.\n\nIncome tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated using the applicable statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the charges (benefits) are incurred, while taking into consideration any valuation allowances. For those items which are non-taxable, the tax expense (benefit) is calculated at 0%.\n\nThese non-GAAP disclosures have limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for operating earnings or Net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Management believes that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding the Company's ongoing operating results. This supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to Net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted operating earnings is set forth in the table above, providing a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted operating earnings to the Company’s reported operating results for its business segments.

"2022-02-04T12:45:12+00:00","Eaton (ETN) Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates","Eaton (ETN) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.72 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.71 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.28 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.58%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this power management company would post earnings of $1.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.75, delivering a surprise of 1.16%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nEaton , which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, posted revenues of $4.8 billion for the quarter ended December 2021, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.16%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.69 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nEaton shares have lost about 9.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -6.1%.\n\nWhat's Next for Eaton?\n\nWhile Eaton has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Eaton: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.66 on $4.82 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.44 on $20.38 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Manufacturing - Electronics is currently in the top 35% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, EnerSys (ENS), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2021. The results are expected to be released on February 9.\n\nThis maker of industrial batteries is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.99 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -22.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nEnerSys' revenues are expected to be $813.6 million, up 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"2022-02-02T20:01:08+00:00","Earnings Preview: EnerSys (ENS) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline","The market expects EnerSys (ENS) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2021. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 9, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis maker of industrial batteries is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.99 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -22.1%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $813.6 million, up 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for EnerSys?\n\nFor EnerSys, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that EnerSys will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that EnerSys would post earnings of $1.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.01, delivering a surprise of -4.72%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nEnerSys doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"2022-01-13T15:34:03+00:00","End-Market Strength Aids EnerSys (ENS) Amid Supply-Chain Woes","EnerSys ENS specializes in manufacturing and selling industrial batteries. It also provides power equipment, battery charges and related accessories. Solid fundaments and strength in segmental businesses are benefiting the company, while supply-chain issues and cost inflation are affecting it.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania-based company presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, which comes under the ambit of the Zacks Industrial Products sector. The industry is in the top 41% (with a rank of 105) of more than 250 Zacks industries.\r\n\r\nIn the past year, the company’s shares have lost 11.9% against the industry’s growth of 8.4%. Also, the S&P 500 and the sector have gained 25% and 5.7%, respectively, during the same period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFactors Influencing EnerSys\n\nEnerSys’ presence in multiple end markets, including energy, industrial, electric utilities, mining, and transportation, helps lower risks arising from too much dependence on a single or few markets. In the quarters ahead, strength across lithium-based battery technology, transportation, and defense end markets are anticipated to be beneficial. Also, geographically, the company seems well-placed in the Americas, Asia, and the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions.\r\n\r\nThe company’s solid product offerings, which include NexSys Thin Plate Pure Lead (TPPL) products, and focus on product innovation as well as sound shareholder-friendly policies raise its attractiveness. Notably, EnerSys had a backlog of >$1 billion at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Oct 3, 2021). The company’s segments, Energy Systems and Motive Power, are performing well. Revenues for Energy Systems grew 8.5% year over year in the fiscal second quarter and that of Motive Power increased 21.6%.\r\n\r\nOn the slip side, EnerSys is facing costs and margin-related headwinds. In the fiscal second quarter, it recorded a 15.6% increase in the cost of sales and a 5.3% expansion in operating expenses. Its gross margin, however, fell 260 basis points (bps) year over year and the operating margin was down 160 bps. In the quarters ahead, the company might continue to suffer from labor, and high tariff and freight problems. Shortages of components might be worrying as well.\r\n\r\nEnerSys is exposed to risks from a highly leveraged balance sheet and international operations. High capital expenditure can also put pressure. For fiscal 2022 (ending March 2022), the company anticipates a capital expenditure of $100 million.\r\n\r\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended December 2021, results are awaited), EnerSys anticipates earnings between 96 cents and $1.06 per share. Earnings were $1.27 per share in the year-ago quarter and $1.01 per share in the previous quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for EnerSys’ earnings per share is pegged at $4.46 for fiscal 2022 and $5.29 for fiscal 2023 (ending March 2023), suggesting a year-over-year decline of 0.7% and growth of 18.6%, respectively. Then again, estimates for both fiscal years have been unchanged in the past 60 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nEnersys Price and Consensus Enersys Price and Consensus\n\nEnersys price-consensus-chart | Enersys Quote\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nThree better-ranked stocks from the industry are mentioned below.\r\n\r\nRegal Rexnord Corporation RRX presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"2022-01-10T12:45:12+00:00","AZZ (AZZ) Tops Q3 Earnings Estimates","AZZ (AZZ) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.85 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.82 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.80 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.66%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this electrical equipment maker would post earnings of $0.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.76, delivering a surprise of 16.92%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nAZZ , which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, posted revenues of $231.74 million for the quarter ended November 2021, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.10%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $226.62 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nAZZ shares have lost about 0.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -1.9%.\n\nWhat's Next for AZZ?\n\nWhile AZZ has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for AZZ: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.64 on $219.8 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.10 on $910.3 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Manufacturing - Electronics is currently in the top 30% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, EnerSys (ENS), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2021.\n\nThis maker of industrial batteries is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.99 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -22.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nEnerSys' revenues are expected to be $813.6 million, up 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
