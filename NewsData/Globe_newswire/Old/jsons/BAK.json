Bear markets naturally have investors wondering when things will turn around. In this bear market, investing in undervalued dividend stocks to buy is an obvious and smart investment choice.\n\nThe safety margin that undervalued stocks offer is like an antidote to the risk-off investor sentiment. The theory suggests that at some point in time, undervalued stocks should converge to their intrinsic values and close the gap between observed and real stock prices.\n\nWith inflation now at approximately 8%, getting paid a dividend yield of more than 8% is enough to generate passive and real income. It is time to play defense and mitigate losses in stocks, which is exactly what these three dividend stocks are about.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n7 Retirement Stocks to Buy for a Bear Market\n\nThese undervalued dividend stocks offer solid financials, a forward dividend yield of more than 8% to beat inflation and a strong chance that Wall Street notices them soon.

It offers loans secured by collateral, including cars.\n\nIt\u2019s a great time to consider adding shares of OneMain Holdings to your portfolio. The shares have losses of nearly 26% in 2022 and trade at a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 4.1. The company began paying dividends in 2019, and its two most recent dividends represent a 10.4% yield.\n\nThe dividend yield history is not stable, but it is consistent. The forward payout ratio of 42% is very safe. The company occasionally offers special dividends such as the dividend of $3.95 back in February 2021.\n\nThe business model is strong. Sales growth has been stable over the past two years, but profitability has gained a lot of traction. In 2021, OneMain reported a net income growth of 80% to $1.31 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe trailing 12-months price-to-earnings growth of 0.36 signals an undervalued stock with a lot of upside potential.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.\n\nOf these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.\n\nZacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the \"Value\" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, \"A\" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.\n\nBraskem (BAK) is a stock many investors are watching right now. BAK is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P\/E ratio of 6.95 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P\/E of 7.13. Over the last 12 months, BAK's Forward P\/E has been as high as 7.57 and as low as 2.18, with a median of 4.38.\n\nValue investors also frequently use the P\/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. BAK has a P\/S ratio of 0.33. This compares to its industry's average P\/S of 0.54.\n\nFinally, investors will want to recognize that BAK has a P\/CF ratio of 1.75. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. BAK's P\/CF compares to its industry's average P\/CF of 5.99.

In a year with elevated volatility and major risks ahead, this outperformance signals that investment opportunities exist everywhere, but stock picking is tough. The S&P MidCap 400measures \u201cthe performance of 400 mid-sized companies, reflecting the distinctive risk and return characteristics of this market segment.\u201d\n\nAt the close of the U.S. stock market on May 20, the S&P MidCap 400 had losses of 16.1% compared to a loss of 18.1% for the S&P 500. It is not a huge difference, but it shows mid-cap stocks offer returns that can be better than the overall index.\n\nThe 7 Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for Income\n\nThese three mid-cap stocks to buy have very high dividend yields.

Shares of ZIM stock are very interesting now for several reasons.\n\nFirst, the company decided to offer shares to the public for $15 each back in January 2021. As of May 20, the closing price was $64.70, indicating a successful initial public offering (IPO) in terms of its financial return almost 1.5 years later.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe second reason ZIM stock is interesting is its very high forward dividend and yield of $19.50 and 30.1%, respectively. Finally, the one-year price target is $87, providing an upside potential of nearly 24%.\n\nZIM reported record results in both full-year 2021 and the first quarter of 2022.

However, this is not a bad thing as long as the fundamentals are strong and the valuation is compelling.

It rose from a rate of 11.9% in 2020 to 80.4% in 2021.\n\n7 Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nThe net income growth in 2021 was stellar at 309%, making a big turnaround after two consecutive years of net losses.

It dipped to 62 cents in December 2021, but it was raised to 68 cents to be paid in June 2022.\n\nIts sales growth is volatile, but its profitability is strong. In the past five years, the company was unprofitable only in 2020. In 2021, it reported net income growth of 474.1% to $1.5 billion.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2022, FS KKR Capital reported a net investment income of 77 cents per share.

Corporate leverage, measured by the ratio of adjusted net debt to Recurring EBITDA[4] in U.S. dollar, ended the quarter at 1.00x. The cash position was US$1.8 billion, a level that guarantees coverage of debt maturities for the next 69 months. This position does not consider the international revolving credit line (stand by) available in the amount of US$1.0 billion, with maturity until 2026, which increases the company's liquidity. In January, the Company disbursed the funds related to the first CRA - Agribusiness Receivables Certificates structured by the Company for the purchase of ethanol, which is used as feedstock to produce Green PE (I'm greenTM bio-based) and ETBE. This operation, in the amount of R$721 million in two series of 7 years and 10 years, highlights Braskem's entry into the Brazilian fixed income market.\n\nESG\n\nStory continues\n\nRecognition\n\nCDP Supplier Engagement Rating: Braskem has invited its critical suppliers to take part in the CDP Supply Chain assessment based on sustainability criteria, since 2016. Suppliers' participation in the Climate and Water themes achieved 87% and 79%, respectively, placing Braskem as a leader in the CDP Supplier Engagement Rating.\n\nEnvironmental\n\nMechanical Recycling (Brazil): in March, the first mechanical recycling line in Brazil was inaugurated in Indaiatuba, S\u00e3o Paulo. The project was made feasibly by the collaboration with Valoren, a company that specializes in the development of new technologies and the management of solid waste recycling. Annually, 250 million units of post-consumer packaging consisting of polyethylene and polypropylene are expected to be converted into 14,000 tons of high-quality resins for reuse as raw materials by the plastics converter industry. Advanced Recycling (USA): acquisition of non-controlling interest in Nexus Circular LLC in January 2022. Nexus is a company engaged in advanced recycling that converts plastics that would have been sent to landfills into circular feedstock used in the production of sustainable virgin plastics. The equity investment allows Braskem to participate in the growing chemical recycling market, supporting Braskem's strategy to drive plastic circularity. EDF Renewables: in April, Braskem announced that it entered into a second wind power purchase agreement with EDF Renewables Latin America, which will enable the construction of a new complex in southeastern Bahia. The new wind power complex, which is planned to come up in 2024, provide sustainable energy to operations for the next 20 years. Casa dos Ventos: Braskem acquired non-controlling equity interests in the special purpose companies, Ventos de Santa Am\u00e9lia and Ventos de Santo Abelardo, both of which are managed by FIP Salus of the Casa dos Ventos group, essentially making the Company as a renewable energy self-producer. Partnership with Sojitz: in March, Braskem announced that it signed a cooperation agreement with Sojitz Corporation to form a joint venture for producing and selling monoethylene glycol (bio-MEG) and monopropylene glycol (bio-MPG), subject to approval from the relevant antitrust authorities. Furthermore, the business plan of the Joint Venture entails investments for the construction of three industrial plants in the first phase, conditioned on the conclusion of technological development, which will be aided by the Danish Company Haldor Topsoe.\n\nSocial\n\nHealth and Safety: in the quarter, the consolidated reported and lost time injury-frequency rate was 1.18 event per million hours worked, an 55% increase over the same period of 2021. The TIER 1[5] rate was 0.07 event per million hours worked, a 12% decrease from the first quarter of 2021, which positions Braskem on par with its peers in the global chemical industry considered references in safety. Meanwhile, the TIER 2[6] rate was 0.44 event per million hours worked.\n\nGovernance\n\nSustainable Development Advisory Board: the Company established an external sustainable development advisory board comprised of four independent professional chosen for their experience and diversity of backgrounds. The external board will support the Global Sustainable Development Committee, which is integrated by Company leaders, in guiding the plans for 2030 and 2050, based on unbiased perspectives of issues related to the environment, health and safety, social responsibility and other relevant ESG topics. Two meetings were held in 2022 in which themes involving Climate Change and the Circular Economy were discussed with members.\n\nThe full earnings release is available on the Company's IR website: www.braskem-ri.com.br\/home-en\n\nBraskem will host conference calls to discuss its Results THURSDAY, May 12 at 10:00 a.m. US ET.\n\nAdditional information may be obtained from the Investor Relations Department at +55 11 3576-9531 or braskem-ri@braskem.com.br.\n\n[1] Based on net profit (loss) attributable to the shareholders of the Company.\r\n[2] For the class \"B\" preferred shares, the amount is R$0.61 per share.\r\n[3] Corresponds to cash flow in U.S. dollar in the last 12 months divided by the Company's market capitalization in the quarter.\r\n[4] Excludes the Project Finance in Mexico and based on Recurring EBITDA.\r\n[5] Incident with loss of containment of products above the limits established in the American Petroleum Institute (API) 754 for TIER 1, based on the product released, or any release that causes: fatality or lost-time injury of an employee or third party, hospital damages or fatality of the external public, financial losses greater than US$100,000, or evacuation of the community.\r\n[6] Incident with loss of containment of products above the limits established in the American Petroleum Institute (API) 754 for TIER 2, based on the product released, or any release that causes: reportable injury of own employee or third party and financial loss greater than US$2,500.

BAK is set to release first-quarter results on May 11. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 82 cents per share on revenues of $4.8 billion.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s delve into the factors that might have influenced the Brazilian petrochemical firm\u2019s results in the March quarter. But it\u2019s worth taking a look at BAK\u2019s previous-quarter performance first.\n\nHighlights of Q4 Earnings\n\nIn the last-reported quarter, the leading plastics producer missed the consensus mark on lower margin in the overseas market. BAK had reported earnings per share of 24 cents, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.51. Revenues of $5.1 billion generated by the firm also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.4%.\n\nNOV Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise NOV Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nNOV Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | NOV Inc. Quote\n\nTrend in Estimate Revision\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter bottom line has remained the same in the last seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 28.7% fall year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 16.3% increase from the year-ago period.\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nBraskem is expected to have borne the brunt of lower sales volumes. In the October-to-December period, the company reported a 13% decline in sales, affected by weak demand in the Brazilian market. The downtrend is most likely to have continued in the first quarter, with export supply chain restrictions. This fall in volume is likely to have dragged down the revenues and cash flows of BAK.\r\n\r\nThe increase in Braskem\u2019s costs might have dented the company\u2019s to-be-reported bottom line. BAK\u2019s cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter climbed to R$21.5 billion from R$13.8 billion in the year-earlier period. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the first quarter due to higher feedstock prices in international markets and global supply chain constraints.\n\nWhat Does Our Model Say?\n\nStory continues\n\nThe proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Ovintiv is likely to beat estimates in the first quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. But that\u2019s not the case here.\r\n\r\nYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: BAK has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 82 cents per share each.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: Braskem currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Sell).\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Braskem, here are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:\r\n\r\nHighPeak Energy, Inc. HPK has an Earnings ESP of +2.97% and a Zacks Rank #1.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\n\nEni SpA has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Braskem has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that E has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P\/E ratio, the P\/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.\n\nE currently has a forward P\/E ratio of 4.78, while BAK has a forward P\/E of 5. We also note that E has a PEG ratio of 0.46. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P\/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. BAK currently has a PEG ratio of 0.52.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for E is its P\/B ratio of 1.03. Investors use the P\/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, BAK has a P\/B of 5.67.\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, E holds a Value grade of A, while BAK has a Value grade of C.\n\nE is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that E is likely the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(CMS), a pioneer in membrane systems for energy transition applications and Braskem (B3: BRKM3, BRKM5 and BRKM6; NYSE: BAK; LATIBEX: XBRK), the largest polyolefins producer in the Americas, as well as a market leader and pioneer producer of biopolymers on an industrial scale, are pleased to announce that the long awaited pilot demonstration of CMS's Optiperm\u2122 technology for light olefin paraffin separation has started up at Braskem's Marcus Hook facility. Braskem and Compact Membrane Systems\n\nThis is the largest demonstration of the Optiperm\u2122 platform to date and includes commercial-sized modules.\n\nOptiperm\u2122, CMS's breakthrough membrane technology, is designed to increase olefin production efficiency while decreasing waste streams, lowering carbon emissions, and reducing total energy usage. The modular nature of membranes allows olefin recovery from small and large process streams alike, debottlenecking processes and leveraging existing infrastructure in a more energy-efficient manner. CMS and Braskem recognize that capturing olefins from unused hydrocarbon process streams is essential to decreasing environmental impact while continuing to create the chemical building blocks for plastic resins and chemical products for diverse customer segments, such as healthcare and hygiene, food packaging, construction, manufacturing, automotive, agribusiness, among others.\n\nSuccessful demonstration paves the way for the roll out of Optiperm\u2122 in olefins applications as well point source carbon capture for SMRs, steel, cement and other decarbonization applications.\n\nPilot details\n\nThis project will address the critical milestones of simultaneously producing high purity (>90%) paraffin and olefin rich streams with a multistage membrane design. The design is a replica of the design with membrane areas balanced between two stages and a full control system to meet stream purity specs. The rig itself was built by Zeton, the world's leading designer and builder of lab scale systems, pilot plants, demonstration plants and modular systems. The pilot has been deployed at Braskem's Marcus Hook facility and will be operated for a period of 500 days. \"Braskem believes that investing in the advancement of technology is a leading factor in the search for a more sustainable future\" says Kevin Soucy, Technology Improvements Manager, Braskem. \"The successful startup of this pilot supports our commitments to the circular economy. Special thanks to both CMS and Braskem team members for completing the first step of such a complex project despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are very excited to continue to work with CMS through optimization and commercialization of their Optiperm\u2122 technology.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nScale Up of Optiperm\u2122\n\nThis is the largest demonstration of the Optiperm\u2122 platform to date and includes commercial sized modules. Previously, CMS has demonstrated the stability of small-scale membranes. This will be the first demonstration that includes CMS's proprietary humidification design and a full-scale commercial membrane module produced at an industrial scale manufacturing facility. Commercial membrane products will be available from CMS as early as 2023.\n\n\"The team is delighted that this pilot unit is up and running. Optiperm\u2122 olefins technology is an important part of our industrial decarbonization portfolio, validating for our customers that CMS technology can enable their business performance and GHG reduction goals. Placing commercial scale cartridges into the field is a major milestone for us and for the planet,\" says CMS CEO Erica Nemser. \"Braskem's vision and commitment to industry leading innovation has made this project the ideal commercial demonstration of our first generation Optiperm\u2122 technology.\"\n\nABOUT COMPACT MEMBRANE SYSTEMS, INC.

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\n\nThe power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Braskem basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor Braskem, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Braskem\n\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2021, this petrochemical company is expected to earn $9.01 per share, which is a change of 376.4% from the year-ago reported number.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Braskem. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 8.7%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Braskem to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $24.25 indicates a potential upside of 30.3%.\n\nThe average comprises four short-term price targets ranging from a low of $17 to a high of $32, with a standard deviation of $6.95. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 8.7% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 72% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.\n\nWhile the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.\n\nHowever, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in BAK. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.\n\nHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets\n\nAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.\n\nWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?\n\nStory continues\n\nThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.\n\nHowever, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.\n\nThat said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.\n\nWhy BAK Could Witness a Solid Upside\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current year, two estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 5.8%.\n\nMoreover, BAK currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much BAK could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Braskem (BAK), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Braskem currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if BAK is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this petrochemical company holds up.\n\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor BAK, shares are up 0.2% over the past week while the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry is up 0.2% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 8.11% compares favorably with the industry's 4.18% performance as well.\n\nConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Braskem have risen 21.07%, and are up 80.21% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved -4.7% and 14.24%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to BAK's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. BAK is currently averaging 612,813 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with BAK.\n\nOver the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost BAK's consensus estimate, increasing from $8.90 to $9.01 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that BAK is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Braskem on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Or else they barely have the earnings to cover the dividend. This could be one reason why the stocks have a high yield.\n\nOften these stocks either have to borrow money, sell assets, issue equity or debt just to be able to afford the dividends or \u201cdistributions.\u201d\n\nIn fact, many REITs (real estate investment trusts) are in this situation. They sometimes camouflage their inability to finance their dividends out of net income earned by relying on sources other than net income.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI wanted to find seven stocks (no preferreds) that have very clean dividend cover. The company does not have to rely on some sort of financing arrangement in order to pay its dividends.\n\nSo I sought out seven large market cap stocks, whose net income earnings can more than cover their dividends out of net income earned by at least 2 times. This is on a forward estimated earnings and forecast dividend basis.\n\nThis filter eliminates many high-yield stocks, almost all partnerships, REITs and pipelines and other assorted stocks (including foreign stocks where we can\u2019t easily project earnings).\n\nIn addition, the dividend yield has to be equal to or greater than 4.5%. Given the 2x cover requirement and the 4.5% yield filter, this implies the market is severely undervaluing these stocks.\n\n7 Struggling Chinese Stocks Set for a Turnaround in 2022\n\nLastly, the market cap has to be greater than $1 billion. This eliminates any iffy situations with smaller-cap stocks that might have had one good year. These high-yield, well-covered stocks are:\n\nChina Petroleum & Chemical Corp (NYSE:SNP) Braskem (NYSE:BAK) Ternium (NYSE:TX) OneMain Holdings (NYSE:OMF) New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:NYCB) Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical (NYSE:SHI) Vector Group (NYSE:VGR)\n\nLet\u2019s dive in and take a closer look at these dividend stocks.\n\nDividend Stocks: China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (SNP)\n\nStory continues Detail of chemical plant, silos and pipes\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMarket Cap: $76.5 billionYield: 8.33%Dividend Coverage: 2.2x\n\nChina Petroleum & Chemical Corporation is a large energy and chemical company, based in Beijing, China. It is involved in both upstream and downstream operations in the petroleum and related chemical industries as well as gasoline stations and depots throughout China.\n\nAnalysts forecast earnings-per-share (EPS) this year of $9.67 and next year of $9.33. This means that its semiannual dividends which totaled $4.48 per share so far this year are covered over 2 times by EPS.\n\nMoreover, the stock is cheap. At Feb. 8\u2019s price of $53.59, SNP stock had a forecast dividend yield of 8.33%. In addition, its forward price-to-earnings (P\/E) multiple is low at just 5.5 times earnings (2021).\n\nOne reason this could be cheap is that investors fear that the U.S. government could end up kicking off all Chinese stocks from U.S. exchanges. There is no reason to believe this will happen in the short term.\n\nEven if it does, anyone would be able to convert their SNP ADRs (American Depository Receipts) into the appropriate number of underlying ordinary shares. These trade on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange under the symbol \u201c0318.HK.\u201d So the fear about lack of liquidity in one\u2019s investment is not borne out by real facts. Value investors will take advantage of this bargain opportunity.\n\nBraskem (BAK) Several natural gas tanks with a sunrise in the background\n\nSource: OlegRi \/ Shutterstock\n\nMarket Cap: $7.8 billionYield: 12.92%Dividend Coverage: 2.8x\n\nBraskem SA is a Brazilian chemical company that makes resins, chemicals, gasoline, plastics, gases, steam and petrochemicals. It has plants and sells in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil and Europe.\n\nAnalysts expect to see EPS this year of $7.29 and next year at $3.89. So its dividend this year of declared on Dec. 2, of $2.6307 (for the full year) is more than covered by earnings by 2 times for 2021. However, if earnings come in at just $3.89 for 2022, its earnings will not cover the same dividend by 2 times.\n\nThe dividend is declared once a year and there is no guarantee, as this is a foreign company, that it will maintain the same dividend. It is likely to be volatile as a percentage of profits.\n\nThe 7 Highest Dividend Stocks for Income Investors\n\nAs a result, even though this stock covers the dividend this year, it may not be able to maintain the same dividend in 2022. Value investors may want to watch the Q1 earnings and prospects for the company before taking a position.\n\nDividend Stocks: Ternium (TX) a steel frame for a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMarket Cap: $8.18 billionYield: 6.75%Cover: 7.22x\n\nTernium is a Luxembourg-based steel and ore mining company with operations throughout South America, as well as the U.S. The company produces all forms of steel and mines iron ore and pellets.\n\nSo far this year the company has declared two dividends (a final dividend in April 2021 for $2.10 and a preliminary dividend in November 2021 for 80 cents). The total dividend of $2.o9 per share works out to a 6.75% dividend yield on its Feb. 8 price of $42.92 per share.\n\nThe full-year dividend appears to be covered by well more than 2 times, even though, like BAK stock above, its earnings could dip this year.\n\nFor example, analysts forecast EPS for 2021 of $20.93, but just $11.70 for the year ending December 2022. Nevertheless, the $2.90 dividend per share is covered more than 4 times even if the EPS falls to just $11.72 this year.\n\nThis high yield makes TX stock a very compelling value play for investors, especially since it appears to be so well covered by earnings by the company. Short of a global recession investors can assume that demand for steel and iron ore will continue to develop well over the next several years.\n\nOneMain Holdings (OMF) a person holds up a scrap of paper that asks \"Are you covered?\"\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMarket Cap: $6.83 billionYield: 6.97%Cover: 2.3x\n\nOn Feb. 2, OneMain Financial released its full-year results showing that the consumer lending and insurance company made $2.02 per share in Q4 2021. That puts the company on a solid financial footing going forward, implying a run rate EPS of $8.08 for 2022. That makes the stock, at $54.02 as of Feb. 8, very cheap at just 6.7 times forward run-rate earnings.\n\nMoreover, management raised the quarterly dividend by 36% to 95 cents per share. This puts the dividend per share at an annual rate of $3.80.\n\nAs a result, the dividend yield is now 6.97%. In addition, given that OneMain Financial made $9.87 in EPS in the last 12 months, the dividend has annual coverage of 2.6 times.\n\nAnalysts expect to see EPS this year of $8.66, according to Seeking Alpha. That puts the dividend on a coverage ratio of 2.3x. It also gives OMF ample room to buy back shares.\n\nFor example, in the last 12 months OMF repurchased $368 million in stock, including $192 million in Q4 alone. In fact, the board approved a new $1 billion share buyback program.\n\nTherefore, at the $192 million quarterly rate, its full year buy back rate is $768 million. With 130 million shares outstanding this is worth $5.91 per share for every investor, or 10.8% of its market value.\n\n7 Top Growth Stocks to Add to Your Buy List Now\n\nTherefore, this shows OneMain is very shareholder friendly. The 7% yield and 10% buyback yield provide a 17% total yield for investors. That could propel OMF stock significantly higher in 2022.\n\nDividend Stocks: New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) A customer makes a transaction at a bank\n\nSource: Africa Studio \/ Shutterstock.com\n\nMarket Cap: $5.32 billionYield: 5.95%Cover: 2.0x\n\nOn Jan. 26, NewYork Community Bancorp reported solid Q4 and 2021 earnings and kept its dividend stable at 17 cents per quarter. The five-state community bank holding company reported EPS of $1.20, up 18% year-over-year on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis EPS was up 43% year-over-year.\n\nMoreover, its full year dividend rate is 68 cents per share. This gives NYCB stock, which closed at $11.10 on Feb. 8, a dividend yield of 6.13%. Moreover, given that analysts forecast 2022 EPS of $1.39 and $1.56 in 2023, the dividend is 2 times covered for 2022 and more for 2023.\n\nMoreover, as a new catalyst for the stock, the board announced that it had reinstated its share repurchase program. This will help push up the stock. It has a $17 million authorization remaining in its existing buyback program.\n\nAs a result of its profitability and its new buyback program, I would not be surprised to see NYCB raise the dividend sometime in the next year. It has kept the dividend at 68 cents annually ever since 2015. At some point, management might consider this, although there is no guarantee this could happen.\n\nSinopec Shanghai Petrochemical (SHI) a silo containing chemicals\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMarket Cap: $5.45 billionYield: 6.69%Cover: 3.0x\n\nSinopec is another petrochemical company based in Shanghai, China, just like SNP stock above. The company is forecast to make $4.62 in EPS in 2021 and estimates are for $5.22 next year.\n\nGiven that its annual dividend was $1.56 per ADR this year, the stock has a dividend yield of 6.69% at Feb. 8\u2019s price of $23.27 per share. The dividend is more than 2 times covered both for 2021 and 2022, although the payment is just once a year.\n\nThat also means its 2021 price-to-earnings multiple is cheap at just 4.5 times forecast EPS of $5.22 this year. So, here we have a similar situation as SNP stock above. Everyone is afraid of these Chinese conglomerates, especially if the company delists from the NYSE.\n\nBut not to worry. It\u2019s also listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange under symbol \u201c338.HK.\u201d So, worse comes to worse, investors would just have to have their brokerage firm convert their ADRs to ordinary shares and they could sell them on the HK stock exchange.\n\n7 Struggling Chinese Stocks Set for a Turnaround in 2022\n\nThis makes the stock a unique value investment opportunity, given the arbitrage opportunities.\n\nDividend Stocks: Vector Group Ltd (VGR) hand of person in a suit dangling keys with a house symbol on the ring. Windows overlooking city skyline in background.\n\nSource: ImageFlow\/shutterstock.com\n\nMarket Cap: $1.72 billionYield: 4.58%Cover: 2.0x\n\nVector Group is a two-pronged conglomerate. It has two divisions. The first makes and sells discount cigarettes. The second provides real estate services, such as brokerage, relocation, real estate sales and marketing and title insurance. It\u2019s a sort of \u201cbarbell,\u201d diversification strategy, especially since selling cigarettes is not considered especially millennial friendly, or let\u2019s say, conventional.\n\nVector Group\u2019s dividend yield is 4.58% at Feb. 8\u2019s price of $11.29, based on its annual dividend 51.72 cents per share. This is more than covered earnings, even though they are forecast to fall to $1.04 EPS this year from $1.77 last year. That puts the dividend cover at 2x this year.\n\nSo, I suppose, if you can hold your nose for the way the company makes money pushing nicotine, then investing in VGR stock could be worthwhile as a value stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

Both companies announced that they have decided to postpone the sale of their interests in the chemical giant, Braskem. The deferment was blamed on capital market instability, which led to levels of demand and price that were not suitable to close the transaction. Further, Novonor's creditors considered the price offered by investors too low.\n\nPetrobras also declared that the Term Sheet, which it signed with Novonor, establishing commitment by both companies to sell their respective stakes in Braskem, is in effect.\n\nBraskem SA figures as the largest petrochemical operation in Latin America and among the five largest private companies in Brazil. As part of the ongoing plans, PBR and Novonor were looking to offload as many as 154,886,547 preferred shares of Braskem. For Petrobras, the proposed sale was an attempt to divest assets and lower its massive debt as it had a net debt of $48.1 billion at the end of the third quarter.\n\nHeadquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. or Petrobras S.A. is the largest integrated energy firm in Brazil and one of the largest in Latin America. The company\u2019s activities include exploration, exploitation, and production of oil from reservoir wells, shale, and other rocks as well as refining, processing, trading, and transportation.\n\nPetrobras currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other players from the energy space that warrant a look include Ranger Oil ROCC and BP BP, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nRanger Oil\u2019s stock has rallied around 198.1% in a year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ranger Oil\u2019s 2022 earnings is projected at $9.02 per share, which is an increase of a massive 152.7% from the projected year-ago earnings of $3.57.\n\nStory continues\n\nROCC beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being around 25%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for BP\u2019s earnings for the upcoming quarter is projected at $1.06 per share, up about 37.7% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s 77 cents.\n\nBP\u2019s stock has increased about 39.2% in a year.

Some fund managers are betting on Dow hitting 40,000 to generate strong returns. However, as we know, big investors usually buy stocks with strong fundamentals that can deliver gains both in bull and bear markets, which is why we believe we can profit from imitating them. In this article, we are going to take a look at the smart money sentiment surrounding Owens Corning (NYSE:OC).\n\nIs Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) a good stock to buy now? Prominent investors were getting less optimistic. The number of long hedge fund bets decreased by 10 lately. Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) was in 24 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of September. The all time high for this statistic is 47. Our calculations also showed that OC isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q3 rankings). Noam Gottesman GLG Partners\n\nNoam Gottesman of GLG Partners\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, lithium prices have more than doubled over the past year, so we go through lists like the 10 best EV stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. Now we're going to take a look at the fresh hedge fund action regarding Owens Corning (NYSE:OC).\n\nDo Hedge Funds Think OC Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?\n\nHeading into the fourth quarter of 2021, a total of 24 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of -29% from one quarter earlier. The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in OC over the last 25 quarters. With hedge funds' positions undergoing their usual ebb and flow, there exists an \"upper tier\" of notable hedge fund managers who were boosting their holdings considerably (or already accumulated large positions).\n\nStory continues Is OC A Good Stock To Buy?\n\nMore specifically, AQR Capital Management was the largest shareholder of Owens Corning (NYSE:OC), with a stake worth $95.4 million reported as of the end of September. Trailing AQR Capital Management was Citadel Investment Group, which amassed a stake valued at $72.7 million. GLG Partners, Renaissance Technologies, and Millennium Management were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Levin Easterly Partners allocated the biggest weight to Owens Corning (NYSE:OC), around 2.39% of its 13F portfolio. Skylands Capital is also relatively very bullish on the stock, designating 1.71 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to OC.\n\nBecause Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) has witnessed bearish sentiment from the aggregate hedge fund industry, it's safe to say that there was a specific group of hedgies that decided to sell off their full holdings last quarter. It's worth mentioning that Gregg Moskowitz's Interval Partners dumped the biggest investment of the \"upper crust\" of funds watched by Insider Monkey, totaling an estimated $5.2 million in call options, and Gregg Moskowitz's Interval Partners was right behind this move, as the fund cut about $2.9 million worth. These bearish behaviors are interesting, as aggregate hedge fund interest was cut by 10 funds last quarter.\n\nLet's go over hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Owens Corning (NYSE:OC). We will take a look at Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:LSCC), Thoughtworks Holding Inc. (NASDAQ:TWKS), AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN), Store Capital Corporation (NYSE:STOR), Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE:COG), Braskem SA (NYSE:BAK), and Smartsheet Inc. (NYSE:SMAR).

That figure was $454 million in OC's case. Smartsheet Inc. (NYSE:SMAR) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Braskem SA (NYSE:BAK) is the least popular one with only 8 bullish hedge fund positions. Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for OC is 29.4. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points.

On the other hand Braskem SA (NYSE:BAK) is the least popular one with only 8 bullish hedge fund positions. AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) is not the most popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still above average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for AN is 59.2. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly positive signal but we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on.

Unfortunately AN wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks and hedge funds that were betting on AN were disappointed as the stock returned 1.7% since the end of September (through 11\/30) and underperformed the market.
