"2022-06-27T13:00:01+00:00","Looking for Stocks with Positive Earnings Momentum? Check Out These 2 Basic Materials Names","Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. ICL Group (ICL) earns a Zacks Rank #1 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.57 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 27, 2022.\n\nICL Group's Earnings ESP sits at 6.21%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.57 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.54.\n\nICL is one of just a large database of Basic Materials stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Lithium Americas Corp. (LAC).\n\nSlated to report earnings on August 4, 2022, Lithium Americas Corp. holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is -$0.15 a share 38 days from its next quarterly update.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lithium Americas Corp. is -$0.16, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 3.23%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, ICL and LAC could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

"2022-06-27T11:45:33+00:00","7 Top Lithium Stocks for the Second Half of 2022","Goldman Sachs just made lithium stocks even more attractive.\n\nJust days ago, the firm said that lithium prices could fall about 10% this year, and as much as 73% next year. But they’re wrong.  For one, as noted by Bloomberg, “Benchmark disputes Goldman’s forecast that a flood of new production is on its way, and that prices will crater as a result.” Benchmark also says the lithium market will remain short until 2025.\n\nMoreover, Bloomberg also noted that “Matt Fernley, the London-based managing director at Battery Materials Review, an industry researcher, said the sell side reports are ‘massively over-estimating’ the ease of adding new supply, and failing to consider the complexity of bringing new assets into production and the qualification requirements.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeanwhile, Time Magazine contributor Emily Barone added that “[w]hile the Earth has plenty of lithium to go around, the supply needs to be extracted from brine pools and underground reserves, and current mining operations aren’t sufficient to keep up with the auto industry’s growing needs.”\n\nSo, if you believe lithium prices are coming down soon, I have a bridge to sell you. With significant demand and little supply, prices won’t come down soon. I’m honestly not sure what Goldman Sachs was thinking. But we should thank the firm for making lithium stocks even more attractive than before.\n\n7 Retirement Stocks to Buy in Unexpected Sectors\n\nTherefore, let’s take a closer look at seven lithium stocks for investors to consider right now.\n\nTicker Company Price LAC Lithium Americas $21.82 SLI Standard Lithium $4.71 LTHM Livent Corp. $24.25 LIT Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF $75.80 BATT Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF $15.36 ALB Albemarle Corp. $224.79 PLL Piedmont Lithium $41.64\n\nLithium Stocks: Lithium Americas (LAC) Mobile phone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the past month, Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) stock has fallen more than 13% to just under $22 per share, where it’s now oversold.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, from current prices, I’d like to see it rally back to about $32 in the long term. Helping the cause is the fact that at its Thacker Pass mine, results of a Feasibility Study on the first phase of Thacker Pass now expects an an increased initial capacity of 40,000 tpa of lithium carbonate. This is up from the previously expected figure of at least 30,000-35,000 tpa of lithium carbonate.\n\nAlso, in April, Deutsche Bank analyst Corinne Blanchar raised the firm’s price target to $40 from $34, with a “Buy” rating. She believes lithium producers are well positioned with pricing improving. And with all of this combined, LAC stock looks like one of the top lithium stocks to consider.\n\nStandard Lithium (SLI) Graphic of Lithium scientific symbol (Li) in the shape of a big white gear with construction equipment and mountain around it\n\nSource: GrAl / Shutterstock.com\n\nSince the beginning of June, Standard Lithium (NYSEAMERICAN:SLI) slipped from just above $6 to now sitting at $4.71 per share. That said, from current prices, I’d like to see the stock retest $5.50 in the near term.\n\nAt the moment, Standard Lithium is working on a 3.14 tonne LCE Indicated Resource, a 150,000-acre joint venture Lanxess Project in Arkansas. “The region is home to North America’s largest brine production fairway with over five decades of commercial production, significant infrastructure, abundant low-cost electricity, access to chemical reagents and water sources. The project is already permitted for extensive brine extraction and processing activities,” the company said.\n\nFurthermore, in the past seven month, three analsysts have reiterated “Buy” ratings on SLI stock. In terms of price targets, the trio of analysts’ estimates range from a low of 13 CAD per share and 14.28 CAD per share.\n\nShould You Buy Apple Stock? Two Key Issues to Consider\n\nThus, investors should pay closer attention to SLI stock moving forward.\n\nLithium Stocks: Livent Corp. (LTHM) Livent Corporation logo on a phone screen. LTHM stock.\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nAnother solid lithium stock to consider is Livent Corp. (NYSE:LTHM), a pure play lithium producer. After dropping from about $34.61 at the end of May to a low of $21.71, LTHM stock became oversold. That said, from current prices, I’d like to see the stock retest at least $31 per share in the near term.\n\nRight now, the company has 16 offices or manufacturing facilities across the world — including its “largest and most diverse manufacturing facility” in North Carolina. It will also soon start phase two of its carbonate expansion in Argentina, with commercial production expected to begin by 2023.\n\nFurthermore, earnings are impressive, too. For the first quarter of 2022, company revenues were up 17% quarter-over-quarter (QOQ) to $143.5 million. Year-over-year (YOY), revenue was up 56%. Also, GAAP net income was 609% higher quarter over quarter at $53.2 million.\n\nIn other words, this is a strong company in a growing industry. And that could mean good things for investors looking for lithium stocks to buy.\n\nGlobal X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) a pile of lithium\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.com\n\nOne of my favorite ways to trade any hot sector is with an ETF, such as the Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:LIT).\n\nNot only does this ETF offer great diversification, but it also does so at a lower cost. At $75.62 per share, and with an expense ratio of 0.75%, the LIT ETF offers exposure to stocks, such as Albemarle (NYSE:ALB), BYD Co. (OTC:BYDDY), LG Chem (OTC:LGCLF), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Livent Corp., Lithium Americas Corp., Quantumscape Corp. (NYSE:QS) and Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) to name a few.\n\n7 Red-Hot Growth Stocks That Will Outrun a Recession\n\nAfter slipping from about $80 back in early April to its current levels, I’d like to see the LIT ETF eventually retest $79 in the near term. At a lower price now, though, investors could take advantage.\n\nLithium Stocks: Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT) a lithium ion battery\n\nSource: Olivier Le Moal/ShutterStock.com\n\nAnother solid ETF to consider is the AmplifyAdvanced Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:BATT).\n\nAt $15.33, with an expense ratio of 0.59%, BATT offers exposure to companies involved in battery storage, battery metals and materials and EVs. Some of its top holdings include Tesla, Glencore PLC (OTCMKTS:GLNCY), Nio Inc. (NYSE:NIO), Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) and LG Chem to name a few.\n\nSince early June, the ETF slipped from about $16 per share to $14.19 per share. From here, I’d like to eventually see the BATT ETF retest a $18 high from early April.\n\nAlbemarle Corp. (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle, the 800 lb. gorilla in the lithium space, has been beaten silly. Since topping out around $273, ALB stock dropped to a low of $198. Now, it’s technically oversold and may be overdue for a pivot higher. And from current prices, I’d like to see ALB retest $270 shortly.\n\nIn May, the company boosted its guidance for the second time for the full year. It now expects 2022 sales to come in between $5.8 billion and $6.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to come in between $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion. And adjusted earnings per share (EPS) is expected to fall in between a range of $12.30 and $15.\n\n“Over the past 12 months, we’ve made significant progress in renegotiating more variable-priced contracts with our lithium customers. Implementation of these contracts is a key driver of the expected year-over-year improvement in our financial results,” CEO Kent Masters said. “We now expect full-year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be up more than 160% from prior year based on favorable market dynamics for our Lithium and Bromine businesses.”\n\n7 Stock Bargains Worth a Look After the Most Recent Pullback\n\nOverall, this is a great sign for Albemarle. And thus, is a good sign for ALB stock investors, as well as potential investors of lithium stocks.\n\nLithium Stocks: Piedmont Lithium (PLL) a lithium mine\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPiedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) fell from a high of about $67.50 to $47.50, where it’s starting to pivot higher. From current prices, I’d like to see the PLL stock rally back to $67.50. Helping, the company’s partner Sayona Mining recently posted positive study results for a North American lithium mine restart. According to a company press release, the study estimates annual production of about 168,000 tonnes per year of 6% spodumene concentrate over a 27 year period.\n\nAlso, in late May, Cowen analyst David Deckelbaum initiated coverage of the PLL stock with an “Outperfom” rating, with a $90 price target.\n\nAccording to the analyst, “Piedmont is underappreciated for its near-term spodumene projects in Quebec and Ghana, which give it price advantaged feedstock towards a vertically integrated lithium hydroxide conversion strategy, while its flagship Carolina Lithium project adds further upside beyond 2025,” as quoted by TheFly.com.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\n$200 Oil Sooner Than You Think – Buy This Now The Best $1 Investment You Can Make Today Early Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air” It doesn’t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million.

"2022-06-23T23:29:22+00:00","5 Growth Stocks to Buy for 5-Bagger Returns in 5 Years","When the markets crashed due to the pandemic, it seemed like the end of the world. However, dozens of stocks delivered multi-fold returns over the next 12-18 months. The euphoric rally in growth stocks was largely over towards the end of 2021. A key reason being contractionary policies coupled with toned down growth expectations.\n\nAs the markets correct, there is pessimism among investors. However, the stage is also being set for the next rally. Over decades, markets have continued to remain in an uptrend amidst intermediate correction. While economic headwinds might sustain for the next few quarters, stocks bottom out well ahead of the economy bottoming out.\n\nIt’s therefore a good time to gradually accumulate growth stocks. If there is any further correction, quality growth stocks can be averaged down.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n7 REITs to Buy for a Profitable Summer\n\nThis column will focus on five growth stocks that can deliver multi-fold returns in the long-term.\n\nLI Li Auto Inc. $39.21 RADA RADA Electronic Industries Ltd. $10.53 TLRY Tilray Brands, Inc. $3.38 LAC Lithium Americas Corp. $21.22 CPNG Coupang, Inc. $11.89\n\nGrowth Stocks to Buy: Li Auto (LI) Li Auto(Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver a six-month period, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) has been an outperformer among electric vehicle (EV) stocks. Almost all major EV stocks have delivered negative returns during this period. On the other hand, LI stock is higher by 19%.\n\nI further believe that LI stock is positioned to be a value creator in the coming years. It’s worth noting that the company still has just one EV model that was launched in November 2019. The model, LI ONE, has been driving strong deliveries growth and Li Auto has also been reporting positive free cash flows.\n\nRecently, the company unveiled Li L9, which is a six-seat, full-size flagship SUV. Deliveries for the SUV will commence in August 2022. This is a potential catalyst for deliveries growth through 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Li reported cash and equivalents of $8 billion as of Q1 2022. There is ample financial flexibility to invest in aggressive store expansion, product development and manufacturing expansion. Overall, Li stock is among the quality EV stocks that’s positioned to deliver multi-fold returns.\n\nRada Electronic (RADA) Large satellite against a backlit cloudy sky\n\nSource: Dejan Lazarevic / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith the defense sector in the limelight due to rising geo-political tensions, Rada Electronic (NASDAQ:RADA) is worth holding. The emerging defense company with a focus on tactical radars has a total addressable market of $6 billion.\n\nRecently, Rada Electronic announced an all-share merger agreement with Leonardo DRS. The latter is a provider of advanced defense electronics products and technologies. For 2021, the combined entity is likely to report revenue of $2.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $305 million.\n\nThe merger is likely to be value creating with the addressable market expanding to $19 billion. Further, with a strong balance sheet, the company will be positioned for aggressive international expansion.\n\nOver the long-term, the merged entity is likely to deliver top-line growth of mid to high single digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR). With a strong credit profile, the company also plans further inorganic growth.\n\n7 Bargain Income Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever\n\nWith positive industry tailwinds, the merger seems to have come at the right time. I believe that RADA stock can be considered for multi-fold returns.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Buy: Tilray (TLRY) Mobile phone with webpage of Canadian cannabis company Tilray (TLRY) Inc. on screen in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter a correction of 81% in the last 12-months, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) looks poised for a reversal. I believe that there are several positive catalysts in the next few years for TLRY stock.\n\nAs an example, Federal level legalization of cannabis is always a consideration. That possibility will open-up a big addressable market and TLRY stock would likely surge.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that for Q3 2022, Tilray reported revenue of $152 million. On a year-on-year basis, revenue increased by 23%. Revenue growth is likely to accelerate as medicinal cannabis also gains traction.\n\nTilray has outlined plans to clock revenue of $4.0 billion by 2024. A key component of this plan is to accelerate growth in the wellness space. I also believe that further consolidation is due in the industry. The Tilray-Aphria merger might just be the beginning of inorganic growth for the company.\n\nOverall, TLRY stock seems significantly oversold. It’s worth noting that 16 analysts have a 12-month forward price forecast (median) of $7 for the stock. This would itself imply more than 100% returns from current levels of $3.3.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) Lithium element on the periodic table. Lithium stocks.\n\nSource: tunasalmon / Shutterstock\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is another quality name among growth stocks to buy. After a correction of 27% year-to-date, LAC stock is in an accumulation zone.\n\nThe demand for lithium will continue to remain strong in the long-term with rising adoption of EVs. Lithium Americas is well positioned to cater to this demand with some high-quality assets.\n\nThe company’s Thacker Pass project has a mine life of 46 years and an after-tax net present value of $2.6 billion. The company also has 44.8% stake in Cauchari-Olaroz, which can deliver an annualized EBITDA of $308 million.\n\nOnce these assets are operational, the company has robust EBITDA and cash flow potential. Importantly, if lithium remains in a long-term uptrend, the NPV of the assets is likely to be higher.\n\n7 Retirement Stocks to Buy for a Bear Market\n\nCurrently, Lithium Americas has $500 million in cash and equivalents. This will ensure steady development of the projects. With Cauchari-Olaroz commissioning due in the second half of 2022, there is a potential catalyst for near-term stock upside.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Buy: Coupang (CPNG) The Coupang (CPNG stock) campus in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter listing, Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) stock had touched highs of $46. There has been a massive correction in the last six-months and the stock trades at $12.2. I believe that CPNG stock is oversold and poised for a comeback rally.\n\nA key reason to be positive on Coupang is clarity on the company’s profitability and cash burn scenario. The company expects long-term EBITDA margin in the range of 7% to 10%. Coupang also expects to report positive adjusted EBITDA by Q4 2022.\n\nCoupang has also been reporting steady growth in revenue per active customer. Once marketing and selling expenses stabilize, growth in ARPU is likely to ensure EBITDA margin expansion.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the total number of Korean online shoppers are estimated at 37 million.

"2022-06-20T10:31:26+00:00","3 Battery Stocks to Buy Before They Boom","Although electric vehicles have garnered intense interest lately, investors may be better served focusing on infrastructure-related battery stocks to buy rather than individual EV players.\n\nWith so many new upstarts in the electrification of transportation, it defies probabilities that all of them will enjoy significant upside success. However, every one of these companies needs lithium-ion-based powerpacks.\n\nFurther, the sharp losses among several EV manufacturers help drive the case for battery stocks to buy. Currently, the pain at the pump has many consumers eyeballing the transition to electrics. However, the free market isn’t stupid. Recognizing the increased demand, electric-powered cars have jumped in price, presenting all kinds of problems for individual players, from the smallest to the biggest.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n7 Retirement Stocks to Buy for a Bear Market\n\nOn the other hand, the list of battery stocks to buy appear more sensible because they’re akin to selling tickets to the big game as opposed to figuring out which team will win the match-up. While you might be limiting the ultimate profitability potential with infrastructural investments, you enjoy a higher chance of gaining something positive with the right names.\n\nTicker Company Current Price PCRFY Panasonic Holdings Corporation $8.26 SLDP Solid Power, Inc. $6.25 LAC Lithium Americas Corp. $20.13\n\nPanasonic (PCRFY) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing/Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the biggest brands among battery stocks to buy, Panasonic Holdings Corporation (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) has been making significant waves in the EV rumor mill. In early March of this year, Reuters reported that the company was looking to purchase land in the U.S. for a mega-factory, with the purpose of building a new EV battery for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nMore recently, InsideEVs.com reported in May that Panasonic was still searching for a U.S.-based site, including Oklahoma as a potential candidate. With the ability to churn out more batteries closer to Tesla’s new home in Texas, PCRFY is poised to drive higher in the market. Demand for Tesla EVs is not just increasing domestically – even right-hand-drive markets are demanding more units.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntriguingly, PCRFY appears to be charting a series of rising lows since the early summer of 2002. Therefore, the new factory site could be the catalyst to send shares flying, making Panasonic one of the best battery stocks to buy for the long haul.\n\nSolid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those investors that want to swing for the fences with battery stocks to buy, Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP) is a very enticing name. Specializing in all-solid-state battery cell technology — the holy grail that could kickstart a new paradigm in the global EV rollout — Solid Power presents a range of improvements over traditional lithium-ion batteries if successful.\n\nWhat’s most pertinent right now regarding wider EV integration is cost. I’ve mentioned this several times before but in February of this year, the average transaction price for a new EV hit just over $60,000. That’s just not sustainable when the median household income in the U.S. is around $70,000. And with inflation eroding the purchasing power of the dollar, consumers are falling further behind.\n\nHowever, Solid Power anticipates that its solid-state batteries could facilitate a 15% to 35% cost advantage over existing lithium-ion battery packs. Combined with other attributes such as higher energy and superior safety profile, SLDP is intriguing.\n\n7 Long-Term Stocks That Never Go Out of Style\n\nStill, as a former special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) with an aspirational target, strict money management would be appropriate.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) a lithium mine\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAlthough not a direct play among battery stocks to buy, Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) is nevertheless crucial to the manufacturing of powerpacks and therefore, to the global EV rollout. A lithium-mining firm, Lithium Americas is focused on advancing the Cauchari-Olaroz and Pastos Grandes projects in Argentina and the Thacker Pass project in Nevada.\n\nWhile EVs have been extraordinarily relevant for years, the military conflict in eastern Europe delivered a brighter spotlight to battery stocks to buy. Essentially, LAC is attractive primarily because of its exposure to generally stable jurisdictions. With China ranking among the top lithium producers in the world, it’s vital that the U.S. and its allies secure supplies of the potential “fuel” for the transportation networks of tomorrow.\n\nOtherwise, we could be suffering a Russia 2.0 scenario all over again.\n\nNow, it’s important to realize that lithium mining isn’t a panacea to geopolitical dependencies, particularly since the process consumes significant volumes of water. Still, as part of a diversified energy network, LAC could make a lot of sense.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

"2022-06-17T11:30:20+00:00","3 Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul","Many renewable energy stocks are going to take a long time to develop into serious growth plays. With the market as bad as it is, it’s unlikely to find short-duration plays to invest in. In fact, I’d avoid them at all costs and opt to invest in longer-term plays.\n\nBy investing in renewable energy stocks, you’re essentially allocating capital in the hope of securing a big payday ten to twelve years from today. Also, by implementing this strategy, we’re essentially conceding that we don’t know what the market will end up doing for the next quarter, year, or even three years.\n\nHowever, we’re quite certain that we’ll hit the big time in the long run. I know this might sound a bit counterintuitive, but the central aim is to time the industry while staying invested throughout economic cycles (usually 4 to 5 years), in turn eliminating systemic price cyclicality.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n7 Long-Term Stocks That Never Go Out of Style\n\nI firmly believe that renewables will come good in the long run and think it’s an excellent play at the moment as they’re overlooked. Here are 3 renewable energy stocks that could hit the big time!\n\nCSIQ Canadian Solar $28.23 LAC Lithium Americas Corp $28.23 RUN Sunrun $21.13\n\nCanadian Solar (CSIQ) A Canadian Solar (CSIQ) display booth at a convention in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nSource: Shutter B Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nCanadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) exhibits a stronghold over the solar modules and storage solutions space.\n\nCurrently, Canadian Solar has the capacity to ship between $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion worth of products per annum. Its product mix capacity includes 22 Gigawatts module shipments and up to 1.9 Gigawatt hours of battery storage shipments.\n\nCSIQ operates in a market that’s forecast to grow by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% between now and 2027, providing it with a massive tailwind.\n\nCSIQ  is significantly undervalued after a near 25% year-over-year decline, making it one of the renewable energy stocks to take a chance on here. The company trades at a 2.94x discount to sales and a 1.16x discount to its forward book value.\n\nStory continues\n\nLithium Americas Corp (LAC) a pile of lithium\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) could be a dominant figure in the primary sector.\n\nThe company operates as a Lithium exploration company with operations in the U.S. and Argentina.\n\nUsed in batteries, Lithium is a fundamental renewable energy push beneficiary. Thus, LAC could definitely benefit from an industry-wide scal-up in the coming years. After all, it’s linked to a domain (renewable batteries) that’s set to grow at a CAGR of 37.29% for the next six years.\n\n7 Tempting Tech Stocks to Pull the Trigger on Now\n\nFurthermore, LAC presents juicy growth metrics. For instance, during the past year, the firm’s book value has surged by 47.33%, its diluted earnings-per-share has increased by 89.06%, and its operating income has proliferated by 93.80%.\n\nLAC is definitely a long-term buy, in my opinion.\n\nSunrun (RUN) The Sunrun (RUN) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in front of an American flag.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nMy interest in Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) stock stems from the rising energy costs in the United States and abroad. I know inflation will eventually cool down as rates rise.\n\nHowever, the inflationary pressure during the past year has caused many Americans to doubt the government’s ability to curb their future energy costs. Thus, I believe many households will sure up by installing solar-powered energy.\n\nSunrun owns much of the residential market and follows a direct-to-consumer approach, which could translate into illustrious profit margins.\n\nFurthermore, RUN stock is significantly undervalued at a price-to-book ratio of a mere 0.78. Additionally, Sunrun sports a three-year normalized net income growth (CAGR) worth 31.57%, prompting me to go for it on this one!\n\nOn the date of publication, Steve Booyens did not hold any position (either directly or indirectly) in the securities mentioned in this article.

"2022-06-14T10:02:25+00:00","7 Growth Stocks With Multibagger Potential by 2025","As a long-term investor, the current year might be among the best times to buy growth stocks. Sentiment has been pessimistic considering macro-economic and geo-political factors. As a result, some high-quality growth stocks have fallen into a deep correction.\n\nA simple investing rule is to buy when fear is the dominant sentiment. Of course, I would go slow and hold a balance of growth and large-cap stocks in the portfolio. However, there is no reason to press the panic button.\n\nEven if there is a sharp slowdown or recession, policymakers will step in with renewed expansionary policies. Growth can therefore be supported.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA slowdown can also be a blessing in disguise as commodity and energy-driven inflationary pressure can potentially ease.\n\n7 Great Dividend Stocks Under $25\n\nIn this column, my focus is on growth stocks from industries that have multi-year tailwinds. They look attractively valued for exposure at current levels. I would not be surprised if these growth stocks deliver multi-fold returns to boost the portfolio health.\n\nXPEV XPeng $23.95 RADA Rada Electronic $11.63 PINS Pinterest $17.22 RIOT Riot Blockchain $4.65 LAC Lithium Americas $20.64 RIG Transocean $4.06 PLTR Palantir $7.64\n\nXPeng (XPEV) The Logo of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng (Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors, also known as XMotors.ai) on tablet. XPEV stock.\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock\n\nI believe that XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) is the best name among Chinese electric vehicle stocks. It’s also among the top growth stocks to consider for multi-fold returns.\n\nPolicymakers in China are considering an extension of EV subsidies. Further, a tax cut on low-emission vehicles has also been announced. Favorable policy coupled with innovation will drive long-term growth for XPeng.\n\nFor Q1 2022, the company reported 159% growth in vehicle deliveries to 34,561. In the next few years, deliveries growth will continue for two reasons.\n\nFirst, XPeng has an attractive pipeline of new models. P5 was launched in October 2021 and G9 is scheduled for launch in the last quarter of 2022. New products will boost growth. Further, XPeng is targeting aggressive expansion in Europe. This is another catalyst for sustained growth in deliveries.\n\nStory continues\n\nTalking about innovation, HT Aero, an affiliate of XPeng, plans to launch flying cars in 2024. Considering these factors, I would not be surprised if XPEV stock trades in triple digits by 2025.\n\nRada Electronic (RADA) Large satellite against a backlit cloudy sky\n\nSource: Dejan Lazarevic / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a rise in geo-political tensions, defense stocks are likely to remain in the limelight. Rada Electronic (NASDAQ:RADA) is an emerging name from the defense sector that’s positioned for multi-fold returns.\n\nAs an overview, Rada is primarily in the business of tactical radars. The company believes that it has a total addressable market of $6 billion. This leaves ample scope for growth in the next few years.\n\nFrom a growth perspective, Rada reported revenue of $76 million for 2020. For the current year, the company has guided for revenue of $140 million. Top-line growth has therefore been robust. Furthermore, Rada targets to achieve revenue of $250 million (organic) in the next three to four years.\n\nClearly, RADA stock looks attractive at a forward price-to-earnings-ratio of 26.1. As defense spending increases globally, the company’s order backlog is likely to swell. For Q1 2022, the company reported an order intake of $29 million, which was higher by 22% on a year-on-year basis.\n\n7 of the Hottest ETFs to Buy Right Now\n\nOverall, Rada is positioned for sustained top-line growth and EBITDA margin expansion. RADA stock can easily do a 2x or 3x in in the next few years.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Smart phone with the Pinterest logo in front of blurred out pinterest post pictures\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock\n\nDeep correction in growth stocks presents a good opportunity to accumulate quality names for the long term. Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) has declined by almost 50% in the last six months. At a forward P/E of 21.8, the stock is worth considering.\n\nI believe that there are two major reasons to be bullish on PINS stock.\n\nFirst, Pinterest reported average revenue per user of $4.98 in the United States in Q1 2022. The ARPU for Europe was 72 cents. However, the ARPU for the rest of the world was just eight cents. Even if the ARPU for rest of the world is around European levels, there is ample scope for revenue and cash flow upside. The encouraging data is that rest of the world’s ARPU increased by 164% on a year-on-year basis for Q1 2022.\n\nFurther, the entire focus is on making Pinterest a proxy shopping platform. I would look at the company as a quality e-commerce bet with global presence. As active users swell, it’s likely that advertising revenue will also increase.\n\nPINS stock has declined from 52-week highs of $82 to current levels of around $17. I would not be surprised if the stock is back to these highs by 2025.\n\nRiot Blockchain (RIOT) Smartphone with Bitcoin chart on-screen among piles of Bitcoins\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRiot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) is a high-risk bet that I would include in my portfolio of growth stocks. If Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surges higher again, RIOT stock would see multi-fold returns in the blink of an eye.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Bitcoin has witnessed correction of more than 50% in several instances in the past. While contractionary monetary policies have impacted the cryptocurrency, the king of cryptos could very well earn it all back when conditions improve.\n\nSpecific to Riot, the company continues to pursue its ambitious growth plans. As of May 2022, the company reported hashing capacity of 4.7EH/s. By January 2023, Riot expects to boost hashing capacity to 12.8EH/s. This would also imply multi-fold growth in Bitcoin production and revenue.\n\n7 Top-Rated Large-Cap Stocks to Buy and Hold\n\nRiot is also well positioned from a financial perspective. As of March 31, the company reported net cash of $113.6 million. The company also has 6,320 Bitcoin held in the balance sheet. Once sentiments reverse for cryptocurrencies, there will be no stopping RIOT stock.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) Graphic of Lithium scientific symbol (Li) in the shape of a big white gear with construction equipment and mountain around it\n\nSource: GrAl / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe electric vehicle industry might be facing temporary headwinds. However, the long-term outlook remains robust with global EV adoption still at an early stage.\n\nWith quality lithium assets, Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is a good way to benefit from the EV boom. LAC stock has corrected from 52-week highs of $41.56 to current levels of $20.98. This presents a good accumulation opportunity.\n\nThe company has 100% ownership in the Thacker Pass project in the U.S. At full production capacity, the project is expected to deliver an average annual EBITDA of $520 million. Further, Lithium Americas also has 44.8% stake in the Chauchari-Olaroz project in Argentina. The project is estimated to deliver an average annual EBITDA of $308 million.\n\nOnce these projects are operational, Lithium Americas is positioned for healthy cash flow upside. Lithium currently $500 million in cash and a strong balance sheet. The project development towards production phase is likely to be steady.\n\nTransocean (RIG) Transocean logo on a laptop screen. RIG stock.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nEven with fears of slowdown or recession, Brent oil is trading near $120 levels. The geo-political risk premium in oil prices is likely to ensure that there is no big correction in black gold. Oil and gas exploration stocks have surged in the last few quarters.\n\nHowever, I still see value in onshore and offshore rig companies. Transocean (NYSE:RIG) is my top pick from the offshore rig sector. Transocean seems positioned for strong growth in the next few years driven by two factors.\n\nFirst, with higher oil price, day-rates are likely to increase. This will translate into higher revenue and cash flows. Further, Transocean still has 12 cold-stacked rigs. As the market gains traction, new order inflow will ensure that rig utilization improves.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Transocean has an order backlog of $6.5 billion. This provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility. Further, the company has a strong liquidity position of $2.7 billion. With a target to deleverage over the next few years, the outlook seems positive.\n\n7 High-Yielding Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy in June\n\nOverall, I would not be surprised if RIG stock sees 4x or 5x gains in the next few years. With a modern rig, the company is best positioned to benefit from the tailwinds.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) A close-up shot of a hand on a screen with the Palantir (PLTR) logo.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) stock has plunged by 58% for year to date. After a deep correction, the stock looks attractive. I believe that Palantir is misunderstood and with innovation in the forefront, the company will create value in the next few years.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Palantir reported healthy top-line growth of 31% for Q1 2022. The company also reported positive adjusted free cash flow of $30 million for the quarter.\n\nImportantly, Palantir has guided for government revenue growth of 30% or higher through 2025. With healthy growth in commercial revenue and customer count, the target seems achievable.\n\nFor the last quarter, Palantir reported an increase in customer count by 40.

Nevertheless, with solid research and knowledge of overlooked assets, it can be done. I often screen for “under the radar” stocks. You see, the big guys on Wall Street require a stock to hold low-risk properties to be considered a credible investment prospect. That’s great news for us retail investors as it allows us to make “smart money stage” moves. The stocks selected in this article could add value to most portfolios. However, invest with caution as they can be highly volatile!\n\n7 High-Yielding Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy in June\n\nHere are my top four stocks to buy that could make you a millionaire:\n\nTicker Company Price LAC Lithium Americas Corp. $25.42 TDOC Teladoc Health, Inc. $36.08 AUST Austin Gold Corp. $1.67 HLBZ Helbiz, Inc. $0.99\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks to Buy: Lithium Americas Corp. (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) is a lithium exploration company with projects spanning the U.S. and Argentina. The firm’s primary objective is to serve the renewable energy boom as a market leader. Renewable mining stocks are hot commodities at the moment as they operate in an industry with high barriers to entry, allowing a select few firms to profit.\n\nLAC recently released its latest investor presentation and revealed a robust capital structure with $492 million of cash on its balance sheet. Lithium America’s dry powder allows it to expand rapidly while increasing its shareholders’ residual value.\n\nTeladoc Health (TDOC) Teladoc Health (TDOC) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s official, Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) stock is now a value play. The stock is trading at a 1.64x discount to its book value, implying that investors are missing out on big time intrinsic value. Furthermore, the firm’s acquisition-type business model allows it to increase its synergies exponentially with the passage of time, subsequently adding value to its income statement. Moreover, TDOC’s integration costs are subsiding with its first-quarter report conveying a 40% year-over-year decrease in the line-item, suggesting that profitability could be around the corner.\n\nStory continues\n\n7 Cheap Growth Stocks That Won't Stay That Way for Long\n\nMuch of TDOC stock’s fate is down to the current market environment. I believe we’ll see a surge in struggling, undervalued stocks once economic circumstances find calm. In turn, this could cause stocks, such as TDOC, to skyrocket.\n\nStocks to Buy: Austin Gold Corp. (AUST) a cart filed with gold in a gold mine\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI spotted this stock while searching for assets trading below their initial public offering prices. Austin Gold (NYSE:AUST) focuses on exploration and mineral property rights in Nevada with its initial project, Kelly Creek, holding six claims and access to 138.2 kilometers of land in the Kelley Creek Basin. Furthermore, the firm holds lucrative interests in the Fourmile and Lone basins, which contain a cumulative 777 lode mining claims.\n\nInvesting in an early exploration-stage mining firm is a risky bet. However, the payoff could be significant. Austin Gold sets itself apart with a team that has built-up several mining projects in the past, including Pretium Resources, SSR Mining (NASDAQ:SSRM), and Uranerz Energy.\n\nIn essence, I’d say that AUST stock is a meme stock with tangible value.\n\nHelbiz (HLBZ) A row of Helbiz (HLBZ) bikes.\n\nSource: MarbellaStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nHelbiz (NASDAQ:HLBZ) is a micro-mobility company situated in Italy and the United States. The firm provides a service that offers a fleet of electronic motorbikes for instant use. HLBZ stock’s prospects are looking up. The firm recently reported its first-quarter results and revealed $3.31 million in revenue, a 224.5% year-over-year increase. Furthermore, the company’s free cash flow and earnings-before-interest-and-tax have surged by 22.44x and 1.63x, respectively, during the past year.\n\n7 Oversold Value Stocks to Buy for June\n\nHelbiz is an extremely risky bet. However, the asset provides an opportunity to jump in at an early stage before institutional money starts flowing in.\n\nOn the date of publication, Steve Booyens did not hold any position (either directly or indirectly) in the securities mentioned in this article.

"2022-05-25T21:00:44+00:00","The Trouble With Lithium","(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk wants to mine it, China is scouring Tibet for it, battery makers are crying out for it. Lithium, the wonder metal at the heart of the global shift to electric cars, is in a full-blown crisis. Demand has outstripped supply, pushing prices up almost 500% in a year and hindering the world’s most successful effort yet to halt global warming.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFed Saw Aggressive Hikes Providing Flexibility Later This Year Biden Demands US ‘Stand Up’ to Gun Makers After Texas Attack Why So Few Big Rats Have Fled Putin’s Ship Stocks Climb in Volatile Session After Fed Minutes: Markets Wrap These Are the Best — and Worst — Cities for Work-Life Balance\n\nThe shortage of lithium is so acute that in China, which makes about 80% of the world’s lithium-ion batteries, the government corralled suppliers and manufacturers to demand “a rational return” to lower prices. Analysts at Macquarie Group Ltd. warned of a “a perpetual deficit,” while Citigroup Inc. nearly doubled its price forecast for 2022, saying an “extreme” rally could be coming.\n\nThe consequences of failure to produce enough lithium are potentially devastating. Global investment in EVs has grown faster than any other new-energy sector over the past few years, outstripping even wind and solar power. Current lithium spot prices could add up to $1,000 to the cost of a new vehicle, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said. Along with higher prices of other raw materials, that is reversing years of falling prices as EVs race to become cost-competitive with gasoline-powered cars. If battery makers can’t get enough lithium, it would curb the expansion of clean-energy vehicles, making it harder to meet global emissions targets.\n\n“It looks like the expansion ramp up is not going to be fast enough to hit demand” over the next three years, said Cameron Perks, an analyst at Benchmark. EV makers “have been asleep at the wheel.”\n\nThe crunch prompted a characteristically blunt tweet from Musk in April. “Price of lithium has gone to insane levels!” he posted on Twitter. “Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMusk’s Tesla Inc. and Chinese automakers BYD Co., Xpeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc. have all already raised sticker prices, as has Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the world’s biggest EV battery maker. “The industry is facing very strong headwinds in terms of cost escalation,” XPeng President Brian Gu told Bloomberg TV in late March.\n\nThe silvery-white metal, the third-lightest element after hydrogen and helium, is in the throes of an unprecedented boom because a slump in 2018-2020 that halved its value caused chronic underinvestment in new sources of supply just as EV demand was taking off. For battery makers, those woes have been compounded by the pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine, which have snarled supplies of other ingredients they need, including nickel, graphite and cobalt.\n\nTightening supply and higher prices have prompted a flurry of acquisitions and joint ventures as battery makers and automakers try to secure supplies, and unleashed a wave of resource nationalism among governments. As early as last June, Fitch Solutions said lithium had become a “strategic mineral,” and warned of “rising government intervention.”\n\nEVs and batteries drew $271 billion and $7.9 billion of investment respectively in 2021, according to Kwasi Ampofo, head of metals and mining at BloombergNEF. “The upstream part of the value chain has, on the other hand, attracted relatively low investment over the last five years,” he said.\n\nRead: How Hot Is Lithium? A Chinese Mine Auction Draws 3,448 BidsLithium has taken a long time to hit the mainstream. Discovered in 1817 by Swedish chemist Johan August Arfwedson, it wasn’t produced in quantity until the US government began stockpiling it to make hydrogen bombs in the late 1950s. After the Cold War, production declined until the metal began to be adopted for use in light alloys, coin cells and then mobile phone batteries in the 1990s.\n\nMore than half of the global resources are located in the so-called lithium triangle between Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, where producers pump lithium-rich brine from underground lakes and allow the liquid to evaporate for 12-28 months to yield a slurry that can be profitably processed. Current technology recovers only about 50% of the lithium in the brine.\n\nMuch of the remaining supply comes from deposits of an igneous rock called spodumene, with Australia the biggest miner. The ore is roasted and leached with sulfuric acid and the silvery-gray residue typically shipped to China to be made into lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate – compounds that can be combined with nickel or cobalt to make battery electrodes, or with solvents to make electrolytes.\n\nThe quickest way to increase supply is to ramp up output from these existing sources. Ganfeng Lithium Co., one of the world’s largest producers, said it’ll use record profits to boost output. Australia’s Pilbara Minerals Ltd. aims to raise production capacity more than 50% by the September quarter by expanding its Pilgangoora mine in Western Australia, a project that includes Chinese partners Great Wall Motor Co. and CATL.\n\nFor many brine-lithium producers, increasing output quickly is constrained by their permits and the time taken to let the liquid evaporate.\n\nOne longer-term solution is to find new deposits.\n\nMining superpowers Australia and Canada has both promised to help develop critical mineral resources, including lithium. China recently announced that its geologists had discovered a spodumene deposit on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau in the region of Mount Everest that could hold more than 1 million tons of lithium oxide. But it takes years to develop a new mine and, in some countries, the process is becoming more difficult due to resistance from local communities.\n\n“There is plenty of lithium in the ground, but timely investment is the issue,” said Joe Lowry, founder of advisory firm Global Lithium. “Tesla can build a gigafactory in about two years, cathode plants can be built in less time, but it can take up to 10 years to build a greenfield lithium brine project.”\n\nRead: Hunt for Lithium Sparks Rush Into Argentine Mountains\n\nRio Tinto Group’s proposed $2.4 billion Jadar mine on farmland in western Serbia, which would be Europe’s biggest, stalled as thousands of protesters marched in the streets. Rio says the mine, originally scheduled to open in 2026, would create more than 2,000 jobs and meet the highest environmental standards, including using recycled water and electric trucks. Savannah Resources’ Barroso project in Portugal and Lithium Americas Corp.’s proposed mine in Nevada are others that have to negotiate local opposition.\n\nChile’s Constitutional Convention this month approved an expansion of environmental governance that includes reshaping water rules and other environmental protections that could affect lithium producers if the charter is ratified in a September referendum. “If you're a multinational company going in to Chile right now, you have to think twice, because you don't know what the rules are,” Lowry said.\n\nBut lithium producers face an even bigger problem. Part of the reason consumers are prepared to pay a premium for an electric vehicle is that it’s better for the environment. But the lithium supply chain is far from green.\n\n“Lithium mineral producers have the greatest need to reduce their emissions profiles,"" said Dominic Wells, senior sustainability and cost analyst at Wood Mackenzie Ltd.\n\nEnvironmental Cost\n\nThe Atacama desert of northern Chile is one of the driest places on Earth, but extracting the mineral from salt flats 10 times the size of New York’s Central Park and processing it requires a lot of water. According to BloombergNEF, it can take about 70,000 liters of water to make one ton of lithium. Mining spodumene is energy intensive and together with shipping the concentrate to China for refining can emit 3.5 times more carbon dioxide than lithium extracted from brine, according to Wood Mackenzie.\n\n“There’s a lot of dirty things happening in producing these materials,” said Steven Vassiloudis, chief executive officer of Novalith, which is working on a system that would streamline processing of spodumene and absorb carbon. “Hard-rock lithium has such a high carbon footprint because of the energy requirement” and the many steps needed in conventional processing.\n\nAutomakers are wading in to protect the “green” image of their electric cars. BMW and a group backed by German automobile giants including Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG and have begun separate investigations into water use and production methods in the South American salt flats.\n\nCompanies are pursuing new technologies to lower expenses, cut water use and green their operations. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle Corp., the world’s biggest lithium producer, is seeking responsible mining certification for its operations in Chile and said it will reduce the intensity of freshwater use by 25% by 2030 in areas of high water risk.\n\n“Producing lithium to use as little electricity and water is a critical goal,” said Ken Hoffman, senior expert at McKinsey & Co. “Coming up with one or several of these novel ways to produce ‘green lithium’ will be vital to the long term success of this industry. Whomever is able to deliver this technology, they should see very strong returns.”\n\nThat prize has spawned a raft of startups. Many are pursuing direct lithium extraction, a term used to describe ways to chemically capture lithium compounds that would speed up production.\n\n""DLE can massively increase supply,” said Hoffman at McKinsey who estimates the technology could come online as soon as late next year. “You don't need two years of drying lithium out from brine. And instead of getting about 40% of lithium out of the brine, you can get more than double the amount.""\n\nIf they succeed, it will still take time to catch up with demand.\n\n""Even if DLE happens, we are still far behind the car companies’ EV plans for at least a decade,” Lowry said. “DLE has to be customized. It's not a one-size-fits-all technology.”\n\nAlbemarle, which carries out its own research, said DLE so far has shown to be “typically less economic and less sustainable than conventional brine resources.” The company said it continues to investigate DLE and other processes to meet sustainability goals.\n\nAlternative Batteries\n\nThe environmental and supply issues have prompted companies to look for alternatives to the lithium-ion battery, including hydrogen. But none have come close to supplanting lithium in the all-important passenger car market, and most are years away from commercial viability.\n\n“Lithium-ion will remain the dominant battery technology, at least up to 2035,” said BloombergNEF’s Ampofo. “Automakers will potentially have to become miners to help develop and scale up some of these next generation lithium extraction technologies.""\n\nLithium-ion batteries fall into a sweet spot that balances high energy density and safety. The mineral is the least-dense solid element with the greatest electro-chemical potential and a very low melting point, producing an excellent energy-to-weight performance.\n\nUlderico Ulissi, battery research lead at London-based Rho Motion Ltd., an energy transition researcher, predicts that solid-state and sodium-ion batteries could eventually challenge lithium-ion packs in some applications in the second half of the decade. “EV qualification, however, is a lengthy process and scaling up manufacturing of new technologies can bring several challenges.”\n\nRecycled Cells\n\nAnother potential source of lithium is from recycling old batteries, a practice that could meet 16% of annual demand by 2035, according to BloombergNEF. But battery retirements are only set to surge after 2030. “Basically, there's just not enough batteries to be recycled right now,"" said McKinsey’s Hoffman, adding that recycling presents its own environmental problems. ""There is no great way to recycle a battery today.”\n\nOne roadblock to investing in output is that not everyone is convinced that the market will remain undersupplied and miners don’t want to be burned again by the kind of glut that caused prices to slump in 2018.\n\nThe upshot is that the lithium crunch isn’t likely to go away soon, leaving an industry that exists because of the need to protect the environment with little option but to ramp up output as fast as possible, even with a supply chain that spews emissions and guzzles scarce resources.\n\n“Yes, it helps to be green,” said Perks at Benchmark. “But right now, we need all the lithium we can get.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMark Zuckerberg Is Blowing Up Instagram to Try and Catch TikTok Elon Musk’s 420-Degree Edgelord Pivot Is Getting Stale The Tech Rout Isn’t Just Cyclical—It’s Well-Earned, and Overdue Deadly Heat in India Is a Warning of Global Catastrophes to Come Open With Care: That Next Power Bill Could Shock You\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trouble-lithium-210044324.html","ALB.US","AMC.F","LAC.TO","LAC.US","TSLA.US","WUC1.F","","","","","","","","","","","BATTERY MAKERS","BLOOMBERG","CHINA","","","","","","","","","","0.997","0.04","0.89","0.07"
"2022-05-24T14:04:01+00:00","Hunt for Lithium Sparks Frantic Rush Into Argentine Mountains","(Bloomberg) -- At a lavish lunch this month in Buenos Aires, 400 mining executives and government officials gathered to toast Argentina’s natural resource riches amid the kind of corporate giddiness not seen since the country’s first attempt to develop its shale oil resources a decade ago.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSocial Media Stocks Sink to Erase $160 Billion on Snap Warning Tech Drags Down US Stocks While Treasuries Climb: Markets Wrap Broadcom in Talks to Acquire Cloud Company VMware Biden’s Latest Taiwan Gaffe Stokes Tensions With Beijing Stocks Climb in Risk-On Day While Bonds Decline: Markets Wrap\n\nThe attraction for investors this time around is Argentina’s lithium. There’s a looming shortage of the rare metal, a key raw material in the batteries used in electric vehicles. Elon Musk signaled Tesla Inc. might get involved in mining to secure supplies. Chinese and US companies engaged in bidding wars for Argentina’s lithium resources, while Rio Tinto Group and Zijin Mining Group Co. are pouring more than a billion dollars into the country.\n\n“If Argentina didn’t come through, it’d be almost impossible for the lithium market to stay well-supplied,” said Michael Widmer, head of metals research at Bank of America.\n\nArgentina has 13 lithium projects in the pipeline, more than any other country. The US has 10.\n\nThe world needs lithium supplies to grow fivefold by the end of the decade to meet projected demand as the electric-vehicle revolution gets into full swing, according to BloombergNEF. It could be Argentina's last shot at moving beyond its traditional offerings of soybeans, grains and beef to emerge as a global heavyweight in a new sector.\n\nThe country has 19 million metric tons of lithium resources that haven't yet been mined, twice as much as Chile. But Argentina has long struggled to lure the consistent, hefty international capital flows needed for mass development of oil, natural gas, gold and silver locked underground.\n\nStory continues\n\nPatagonian shale formation Vaca Muerta is perhaps the best example. A decade ago, it was all buzz and promise. There was a special exemption from capital controls that attracted Chevron Corp. But the trickle never became a flood: Argentina's broader woes and interventions in fuel markets kept development in check.\n\nNow, the world’s largest lithium producer, Albemarle Corp., plans to restart exploration in the Salar de Antofalla in Argentina, a more remote and less developed area than Australia and Chile, where the company has been mining so far.\n\n“We don’t always get to choose where our resources are. Now, the EV market is accelerating and demand is really growing, we need to develop that next resource,” said Kent Masters, chief executive of Albemarle.\n\nIt’s a tall order. A two-year price slump through the middle of 2020 had put some new mines on hold and had driven investors away, meaning that additional supply isn’t growing fast enough now.\n\n“It’s more mature on the demand side now. You can bank on it more,” said Jon Lamb, portfolio manager at a metals and mining investment firm Orion Resource Partners. Consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence expects the lithium market to grow to $40 billion by 2030 from just $1.2 billion in 2015.\n\nPosco Holdings Inc., one of the largest steelmakers, is investing $830 million in a lithium hydroxide plant in Argentina.\n\nSuch investment is crucial, considering that Australia and Chile’s dominance in lithium is set to fade. While Australia and Chile account for 76% of output, their share in the project pipeline is only around 34%, BofA’s Widmer said in a note.\n\nArgentina will overtake Chile in lithium production around 2027, according to Daisy Jennings-Gray, senior analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, which advises governments on critical minerals. Lithium Americas Corp. and Ganfeng Lithium Co.’s Cauchari-Olaroz is likely to be the first new project to produce significant volumes in 2023.\n\nArgentina, Chile and Bolivia -- the so-called lithium triangle -- account for more than half of global resources, and are looking to cooperate on ways to move beyond mining the metal into producing higher-value products.\n\n“The three countries have different perspectives on how to produce the lithium, but we have a shared perspective on what to do next with it,” Argentina Mining Undersecretary Fernanda Avila said. “We’re working together to develop new technologies and techniques to go further in the value chain.”\n\nWith history of capital controls, which Argentina uses to protect its foreign reserves, the country fights the perception of being “like ‘Hotel California’. You can come in anytime you want, but you can never leave,” said Andy Bowering of American Lithium Corp., which has a project in Peru.\n\nArgentina makes companies turn export revenues into pesos. It then stops them from freely accessing dollars or pounds again and moving them abroad. For instance, several commodities companies including top shale oil driller YPF SA had to re-finance dollar bonds because Argentina won't let it buy enough greenbacks to service debt. But with the country stuck for ways to grow the economy, especially in the mining sector, it recently created capital-control loopholes for big investors.\n\nThe world’s hunger for lithium outweighs all the hesitancy, said Jon Evans, chief executive of Lithium Americas, which outbid China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the world’s largest battery maker, to buy Millennial Lithium Corp. last year. The three-way bidding battle for Millennial’s lithium assets in Argentina lasted four months and included two Chinese suitors.\n\nArgentina “is the best lithium opportunity in South America,” Evans said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Thrill of Better Office Wi-Fi The Math Prodigy Whose Hack Upended DeFi Won’t Give Back His Millions Compensation Is Becoming an Even Bigger Headache in the Remote-Work Era Open With Care: That Next Power Bill Could Shock You The Most Important Force in Food Has Nothing to Do With Fake Meat\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hunt-lithium-sparks-frantic-rush-140401957.html","LAC.TO","LAC.US","WUC1.F","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ARGENTINA","BLOOMBERG","CHILE","LITHIUM HYDROXIDE","","","","","","","","","0.984","0.045","0.875","0.079"

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): There’s plenty of upside momentum ahead for this severely undervalued tech stock. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA): This undervalued Bitcoin mining is technically oversold, and ready to bounce with Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Lithium Americas (LAC): Oversold lithium miner could pop with demand still outweighing supply. Roblox Corp. (RBLX): Gaming stock showing signs of life again thanks to strong April numbers. Cameco Corp. (CCJ): Uranium stock that could see higher highs on increased demand. Costco Wholesale (COST): Beaten down big-box retailer has become oversold Microsoft (MSFT): Analyst just reiterated a buy rating on the tech giant with a price target of $411 a share.\n\nMarkets have been an absolute disaster lately. Over the last few weeks, the Dow Jones Industrials lost about 4,000 points. The NASDAQ lost about 3,000 points while the S&P 500 sank about 800 points. That’s all thanks to the Federal Reserve, sky-high inflation, uncertainties with Russia and growing fears of recession.\n\nHowever, fear could soon turn into opportunity, as markets become wildly oversold and bargain stocks begin to surface. In fact, as we’ve learned from Warren Buffett, Baron Rothschild and Sir John Templeton, fear can often lead to riches. For example, Buffett tells us to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy. Baron Rothschild tells us to buy when there’s blood in the streets. Sir John Templeton tells us to buy on excessive pessimism.\n\nAlso, it’s tough to ignore some of these bargain stock pullbacks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n7 Undervalued Stocks to Buy Before Investors Catch On\n\nIn fact, here are seven bargain stocks you may want to consider right now.\n\nAMD Advanced Micro Devices $99.99 MARA Marathon Digital Holdings $10.57 LAC Lithium Americas $25.33 RBLX Roblox Corp. $34.75 CCJ Cameco Corp. $23.35 COST Costco Wholesale Corp $427.80 MSFT Microsoft $256.96\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\nStory continues AMD (AMD) sign outside of office building with greenery\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nSince late November, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fell from a high of over $160 to recent double bottom support around $83 a share. It’s also oversold on relative strength (RSI), MACD and Williams’ %R. From a current price of $99.99, I’d like to see it challenge prior resistance around $120.\n\nEven better, there’s plenty of growth at AMD. In its most recent quarter, the company posted EPS of $1.13, which was well above expectations for 91 cents. Revenue hit $5.9 billion, up 71% year over year. It also beat expectations for $5.5 billion. In addition, the company said it expects $6.5 billion in sales in the second quarter. That’s also better than expectations for $6.38 billion.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings (MARA) A concept coin for Bitcoin Gold (BTG) next to Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) has become brutally oversold. After a nasty pullback from about $48,000 to $26,000, it’s showing signs of life again. It’s also incredibly oversold on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R.\n\nPlus, most of the Terra USD (UST-USD) crash may have been priced into the crash, too. And crashing along with Bitcoin were Bitcoin miners like Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA).\n\nHowever, when Bitcoin starts to pivot higher, I expect for MARA to follow, as it typically does.\n\nIt’s also tough to ignore MARA at around the $10 level, especially when it’s growing. In its most recent quarter, MARA revenue soared to $51.7 million, a 460%-plus jump year over year.\n\n7 Oil Stocks to Buy With Safe Dividends\n\nIt also produced 1,259 Bitcoin, a 556% increase year over year, as it increased its hash rate 449% year-over-year.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) lithium (LI) on the periodic table\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWith electric vehicle demand only accelerating, the lithium story is still red hot. In fact, I expect for the story to get even hotter, as lithium demand continues to outpace supply.\n\nConsider this. First, governments all over the world want millions of electric vehicles on the roads. Second, major automakers are aggressively moving into electric vehicles.\n\nHowever, there’s just not enough lithium supply. Even the International Energy Agency says, “The supply of critical minerals crucial for technologies such as wind turbines and electric vehicles will have to be ramped up over the next decades if the planet’s climate targets are to be met,” as quoted by CNBC.\n\nThat’s where a company like Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) may be able to help. With its Thacker Pass mine for example, “The Company continues to advance a feasibility study for Thacker Pass with targeted capacity of 40,000 tpa LCE and incorporating a second phase expansion to reach a targeted total capacity of 80,000 tpa LCE. Results of the feasibility study are expected in the second half of 2022,” as noted in a company press release.\n\nRoblox Corp. (RBLX) Roblox Stock IPO\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter slipping from about $79 in the middle of January to a recent low of $21.65, Roblox Corp. (NYSE:RBLX) is a steal here.\n\nSure, the company just lost 27 cents a share, which was more than expectations. Revenue and active users even came in lighter than expected. Worse, bookings came in a $631.2 million, which was down about 3% year over year. Net loss was up to $160.2 million. That’s all terrible news.\n\nHowever, don’t write the stock off just yet.\n\nAccording to CEO David Baszucki, as quoted by CNBC, “March was a very difficult compare. We were all locked down a year ago. We’re happy that in April, we’ve seen that start to turn around. We think longer term, we’ll see booking start to catch up with user growth.”\n\nThe 7 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy Now\n\nWith that, RBLX stock is starting to pivot higher.

(CCJ) CCJ Stock: Hand in long yellow glove holding a chunk of uranium material\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/RHJPhtotoandilustration\n\nWith uranium prices set to push higher, Cameco Corp. (NYSE:CCJ). could be a standout winner. Oversold at $23.35, the stock is just starting to pivot higher from over-extensions on its RSI and MACD. From a current price of $22.15, I’d like to see the stock challenge $26, near-term.\n\nAccording to John Ciampaglia, CEO of Sprott Asset Management, as noted by Kitco.com, “We think there is still a lot of runway left in the uranium price. There is a serious supply and demand imbalance in the market that can only be fixed with higher prices. Two years ago, you couldn’t have a conversation about nuclear energy. There was still a lot of fear in the market. Now everyone wants to talk about it. The conversation is just getting started as governments want clean, secure, and reliable energy.”\n\nCameco also just caught an upgrade from RBC analyst Andrew Wong, who now has a “buy” rating on the stock. The Russia-Ukraine war is a key factor, with Europe likely to invest more in nuclear power. We also have to consider that Russia supplies a good deal of uranium for nuclear power plants. If that supply takes a hit, prices would also rise.\n\nCostco Wholesale Corp. (COST) Costco (COST) logo on a sign on a Costco store.\n\nSource: ARTYOORAN / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ:COST) sells products that consumers must have no matter how well or how poorly the economy is doing. Even better, earnings are solid. For its second quarter, the company saw EPS of $2.92 on sales of $51.9 billion. That was better than expectations for EPS of $2.76 on sales of $51.53 billion. Same-store sales were up 11.1%. Add in a dividend yield of 0.73%, and you have an attractive stock.\n\nAccording to Barron’s contributor Teresa Rivas, “‘Near-term, the market may be underestimating the strength of Costco’s position with higher inflation’ wrote Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink, given that the overall results confirmed the company’s ability to handle this and other supply-chain related headwinds.

From a current price of $256.96, I’d like to see it challenge resistance around $290, near-term.\n\nEarnings have been strong, with the company delivering revenue of $49.4 billion, an 18% jump year over year. That was also above estimates for $47.5 billion. Also, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth just reiterated a “buy” rating on the stock, with a price target of $411.\n\nAs noted by Barron’s contributor Karishma Vanjani, “Feinseth bases his upbeat rating on the belief that large and small enterprises will continue their adoption of Microsoft’s Cloud, Office, and Teams products as digitization accelerates.

"2022-05-13T03:24:35+00:00","Albemarle Tops Our List of Lithium Stocks - Who Else is Worth Checking Out?","This article was first published on Simply Wall St News .\n\nLithium has been the talk of the town recently and it’s no secret as to why. Recent estimates from McKinsey suggest a global demand of around 3 million metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2030. In contrast, the total global LCE output for 2021 amounted to only 540,000 metric tons, a mere 18% of the anticipated need for 2030. These figures point to a potential shortfall in the future and questions are being raised over how this demand will be met.\n\nThe rise in this demand is attributed to an increase in consumer demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs). These EVs are requiring batteries that have higher energy densities and longer lifespans, the main component of which is high-grade lithium. The sudden rise in demand has caused raw lithium prices to skyrocket, leaving battery producers scrambling to secure their supply of a commodity that is quickly entering into a shortage. So this begs the question: Which companies are best positioned to take advantage? Mined production volume, modelled for 93% available capacity. Source: Minespans, McKinsey lithium demand model\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)\n\nAlbemarle is a global leader in the extraction and production of lithium, bromine and refining catalyst solutions. Lithium is undoubtedly the largest branch of the business, accounting for 42% of the US$3.3B in net sales for the 2021 calendar year. \r\nAt a current output of 88,000 metric tons of LCE per year, Albemarle asserts itself as a dominant player in the lithium market at 16% total market share. The company is poised to continue in a strong market popsition with plans expand processing infrastructure in 2022 and with the long-term goal of more than doubling their lithium production capacity. With this expansion pipeline, they'll be targeting low-cost juristictions to reduce capital expenditure and impove returns.\n\nHere are where we see Albemarle’s competitive advantage lay:\n\nProject feasibility. Albemarle has proved it can already economically produce battery grade lithium in a period where lithium prices were much lower, illustrating the company’s ability to continue operations should lithium prices fall. Ability to be self-funded. Albemarle's lithium branch is already profit making, so earnings can be retained and capital can be invested into the aforementioned expansion projects without the need for significant capital raises or taking on large amounts of debt. Smaller companies and emerging players will have to undergo financing stages which carry risks and may result in shareholder dilution.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlbemarle has a firm grasp on the market and seems positioned to continue riding this lithium wave from strength to strength. But these factors don’t paint the full picture and investors should always consider the financials of a company to inform their assessment. You can see our analysis of Albemarle’s financials for free on our website .\n\nSociedad Química y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM)\n\nSociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM) stands as the NYSE’s other lithium giant. Producing 101,000 metric tons of LCE during 2021, SQM’s impressive output accounts for 18.7% of global lithium production for the year and with several project expansions in the works, this output will continue to scale with the market demand.\n\nAccording to SQM’s latest earnings report, 2022 sales estimates top out at 140,000 metric tons of lithium, with capacity potentially reaching 190,000-200,000 should expansion projects be completed in time, and dependant on the market demand for lithium.\n\nHere are the key factors driving the company forward in the next few years:\n\nSignificant Expansion pipeline. With SQM’s joint venture in Mt Holland expecting to enter production in 2024 and a drastic increase to the production capabilities of their Salar del Carmen project, there’s ample opportunity for the company to grow their presence in the market and beat out new entrants. Variable exposure to lithium prices. Looking forward to 2022, SQM’s sales contracts are detailed as follows: 20% fixed or variable price, 50% variable price with a ceiling and 30% not contracted. This means that SQM will still be exposed to the increase in lithium prices on previously negotiated contracts even if the price of lithium was lower at the time the contract was agreed upon, opening the company up to increased revenues.\n\nInvestors should always consider the risks and financial health of a company to inform their investment decision. You can see our rundown of SQM’s risks and financials for free on our website .\n\nLivent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM)\n\nLivent’s premier resource is located in Salar Del Hombre Muerto in Argentina, achieving a reasonable current output of 27,000 metric tons of Lithium Carbonate and Lithium Chloride. While this is modest in comparison to the big players in the sector, expansion is at the forefront of the company’s mission, with a 20,0000 metric tons expansion of their Argentinian operation slated for 2023 and a further 20,000 metric tons anticipated for 2025.\n\nLivent’s production figures account for around 5% of the total market share. While this lags the other two companies, Livent’s key focus on cost leadership within the production of LCE, Lithium Hydroxide and Lithium Chloride should provide an advantage over its peers.\n\nThese are the factors that are important to the performance of Livent:\n\nLow cost focus. High lithium prices can make many more projects economically feasible, but striving for lower operating costs will mean a project can weather the storm if demand and prices fall. By securing a low-impurity lithium resource, Livent has allowed processing costs to be cut, giving a competitive advantage over other brine operations. Exposure to Lithium Carbonate, Lithium Chloride and Lithium Hydroxide prices. New high-density batteries are more compatible with lithium hydroxide owing to greater nickel content in the cathodes. Should primary lithium demand switch from carbonate to hydroxide, Livent’s exposure to the prices in both products should help it navigate pricing volatility.\n\nLivent is a smaller company and that does carry some possible risks. Investors who are interested in finding out more can do so for free on our website .\n\nThe Future Prospects\n\nWhen you take a step back and look at the global lithium sector, you begin to see a trend. Most supply comes from a select few companies, leaving a mass of newcomers are scrambling to secure funding to bring their projects to market. After all, there’s no shortage of lithium resources on Earth, just a shortage of processing power to extract it from the ground and refine it. New companies coming to the table will reach maturity and begin reaping the rewards of their capital investments. These next few companies aren’t generating significant revenues but we believe they’ll be ones to watch.\n\nLithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC)\n\nLithium Americas is an emerging player in the sector. Their flagship project is their Cauchari-Olaroz brine resource in Argentina, which is currently 85% through the construction of its Stage 1 production facility, targeting 40,000 metric tons per annum (tpa) of battery-grade lithium carbonate. Lithium Americas is striving for cost leadership, forecasting operating expenditure of US$3,600 per metric tonne. With a project life of 40 years and a second stage expansion already on the cards, there is plenty to keep investors following their developments closely.\n\nHere are some of the Lithium Americas’ most eye-catching features:\n\nCompleted acquisition of Millennial Lithium in January 2022. Lithium Americas now has 100% ownership of the advanced-stage Pastos Grandes project, which is located nearby to their Caucharí-Olaroz tenements. The transaction was completed for around US$400 million and provides Lithium Americas with exposure to a rich brine resource of 4.1 million metric tonnes of LCE. Continued development of Thacker Pass resource. Lithium Americas has a 100% stake in one of the largest resources in the United States. The project’s feasibility study is due in the second half of 2022, targeting 40,000 tpa of lithium carbonate, with scenarios being assessed for expansion up to a total of 80,0000 tpa. Preparation work to begin construction of the initial infrastructure is set to commence in 2022.\n\nFor those who are eager to find out more, you can do so by taking a look at the future growth section in our company report for Lithium Americas on our website .\n\nPiedmont Lithium Inc. (NASDAQ:PLL)\n\nPiedmont Lithium Inc. is a lithium company looking to develop key strategic assets in North Carolina, Quebec and Ghana. With a consolidated enterprise targeting 60,000 tonnes of LiOH per year and an additional 390,000 tonnes per year in spodumene concentrate (SC6) production, Piedmont is looking to become a significant player in America’s shift to newer energy initiatives.\n\nHere is why Piedmont Lithium’s future may become interesting:\n\nEntered into a binding agreement with Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to supply spodumene concentrate from their North Carolina project. The agreement is for an initial five-year term on a fixed price commitment representing one-third of Piedmont’s planned production from their North Carolina project. Deliveries planned to begin between July 2022 and July 2023, but timeline has been postponed indefinitely due to delays in development. The Carolina project offers industry leading sustainability with close proximity to a key target market. Piedmont owns 100% of the project which is set to lead the way in terms of cost and sustainability, offering much lower direct water usage in the processing of lithium hydroxide, requiring only 6,300 gallons per tonne of LiOH. Compare this to Chilean projects in the Atacama region which need up to 124,000 gallons of water per tonne, it’s clear to see where the benefits lay for Piedmont as water scarcity continues to be a frequent discussion point into the future.\n\nIf you’re looking to find out about the growth estimates for Piedmont Lithium Inc. (NASDAQ:PLL), we encourage you to take a deep dive into our coverage of analysts’ estimates for the company in our company report .\n\nStandard Lithium Ltd. (NYSE:SLI)\n\nStandard Lithium Ltd. is a steadily growing lithium prospect, headquartered out of Vancouver, Canada. Touting itself as “America’s 21st Century lithium company”, Standard Lithium vows to be the answer to the question of lithium supply but within an innovative context. Partnering with chemical major LANXESS AG (ETR:LXS) , the company is planning to implement ground-breaking technology and leverage their class leading resource to help them rise to the top of the lithium game.\n\nHere are some points of interest to kick-start your research into Standard Lithium:\n\nAbility to fast-track commercial brine operations using existing brine operations. Standard lithium is able to piggy-back its operations off of LANXESS’ existing bromine extraction facility, negating the need for exorbitant capital expenditure that other companies of similar size will have to go through. First to market with a revolutionary extraction process. Standard Lithium has developed its own direct lithium extraction (DLE) process called LiSTR. The company promotes this proprietary process as being able to deliver increased recovery efficiency when compared to traditional evaporation methods and a smaller environmental footprint. The most valuable part of this process is that it is scalable, modular and able to be bolted on the LANXESS’ existing bromine infrastructure, allowing Standard Lithium to bring their lithium to market more quickly than competitors.\n\nFor those that appreciate the future merits of Standard Lithium Ltd. (NYSE:SLI) and wish to know more about the company’s current financial health can do so by heading to the company report on our website.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWith expansion on the horizon for all of these companies, it appears that they’re all well positioned to tackle the impending energy revolution. But this shift to cleaner energy isn’t just going to impact lithium companies. Energy production, storage and personal transportation industries are primed to undergo rapid change as fossil fuels are phased out, paving the way for innovation.

Lithium Americas (LAC) is a lithium mining startup with two major lithium projects coming online this year. Livent Corporation (LTHM) is a leading pure-play lithium producer expected to double its production capacity by next year. Albemarle Corporation (ALB) is a specialty chemicals giant focused on expanding its hugely successful lithium business. Lithium element on the periodic table. Lithium stocks.\n\nSource: tunasalmon / Shutterstock\n\nLithium demand has soared over the past few years with the surging popularity of electric vehicles (EVs). Multiple market studies suggest that the industry will grow at an incredible pace over the next ten years. Hence, lithium stocks can potentially be lucrative investments down the line.\n\nLithium stocks have been performing well for the better parts of the past couple of years. A lot has to do with the mind-boggling growth in EV sales. In 2021, EV sales volume shot up to 6.7 million units, representing a 108% bump from 2020. By 2030, demand for lithium will rise to two million metric tons.\n\nLithium prices are rising aggressively as supply has failed to keep up with ballooning demand. Therefore, lithium-producing firms are in for some enticing price realization in the foreseeable future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for May With Yields Over 6%\n\nHere are three lithium stocks to invest in this month:\n\nLAC Lithium Americas Corp. $24.56 LTHM Livent Corporation $28.03 ALB Albemarle Corporation $242.50\n\nLithium Stocks: Lithium Americas (LAC) Lithium Americas logo on a phone screen in front of a computer showing their website. LAC stock.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is a lithium mining start-up with plenty of potential to profit from booming lithium demand. Moreover, with producer nations looking to foster a domestic production base, the company can benefit immensely from the trend.\n\nThe Canadian lithium miner has a couple of major lithium projects that could bring in the big bucks in the coming years. The first is its Argentinian lithium brine project called the Cauchari-Olaroz, which should commence production later this year. Moreover, it has also acquired one of its peers in Millennial Lithium, with major lithium mining assets in Argentina.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, LAC is working on another exciting project in Nevada called Thacker Pass. According to the company, it is the largest known lithium resource in the U.S. However, it has been the subject of controversy, but it could be a massive money-spinner for LAC stock if it gets through the legal hurdles.\n\nLivent Corporation (LTHM) Livent Corporation logo on a phone screen. LTHM stock.\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nLivent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) is one of the top integrated pure-play lithium producers. It sells lithium compounds to EV original equipment manufacturers and leading battery makers across the globe. International diversity has been one of its key differentiators, which gives it access to multiple manufacturers. It produces lithium with the lowest-cost resources, giving it a major competitive advantage. Livent currently has over 20,000 metric tons production capacity, which could double by the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe firm has been extracting lithium from Salar del Hombre Muerto in Argentina for the past two decades. It also produces qualified battery-grade lithium in the U.S. and China and is on track for capacity expansions.\n\n7 Restaurant Stocks Ready for a 'Revenge Travel' Rally\n\nMoreover, the financials are rock solid for the business, with revenues above 45% in the past year. Additionally, its EBITDA growth was at a spectacular 365% for the year. With the rising lithium demand and stronger margins, the business is in for another robust showing this year and beyond.\n\nLithium Stocks: Albemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) is a specialty chemicals producer that aims to expand its lithium business rapidly. It’s not a sector pure-play, but its lithium segment now accounts for 41% of total revenues and over 50% of its adjusted EBITDA. Last year, its lithium business grew at 19% compared to just 6% of total revenue growth. Albemarle’s lithium business will become a major growth catalyst, with the industry expected to grow extensively over the next few years.\n\nThe company has been investing heavily in acquiring lithium mining and converting properties in recent years. For instance, it acquired lithium converting giant Guangxi Tianyuan Corporation, strengthening its position in China. Moreover, Albermarle has a 49% stake in the Greenbushes mine, producing more than 60,000 metric tons every year.\n\nIn terms of financials, the firm has been knocking it out of the park. Its top- and bottom-line performance last year tracked well over its five-year averages. Additionally, it has been a dividend aristocrat, boasting 28 consecutive years of growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

"2022-05-07T10:18:07+00:00","7 Growth Stocks That Have Become Deep Value Plays","These growth stocks have witnessed a meaningful correction in 2022 and trade at attractive levels. XPeng (XPEV): Strong vehicle deliveries growth with new models and international expansion. Tilray (TLRY): Has a road map for $4 billion in revenue by 2024. Lithium Americas (LAC): A strong asset base, which will translate into sustained EBITDA growth once commercialized. Blink Charging (BLNK): Robust revenue growth is likely to sustain with aggressive international expansion. UiPath (PATH): Is seeing strong growth in its customer base and annual recurring revenue with an addressable market of $60 billion. Coinbase (COIN): As assets on its platform increase, transaction revenue is likely to trend higher. Kinross Gold (KGC): Sale of assets provides robust financial flexibility for production growth from core assets. growth stocks to buy: tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background\n\nSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com\n\nGrowth stocks have been going through challenging times in 2022. The S&P 500 Pure Growth Index has declined by 19.3% during this period.\n\nThere are several reasons for this correction. First, inflation has been a concern, and rate hikes will imply liquidity tightening. This has reduced the appetite for risk-on trade on a relative basis.\n\nAlso, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is likely to impact global growth. There are already supply chain issues, and high-flying growth stocks have shed some valuation premium.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt seems likely that challenging times for equities will sustain in the near-term. However, every correction provides an entry opportunity into growth stocks that can be long-term value creators. There were dozens of stocks that delivered multifold returns after the pandemic-driven crash.\n\nIt’s also important to note that even with four or five rate hikes, real interest rates will remain negative. This will imply funds are flowing into equities and other risky asset classes.\n\n7 Restaurant Stocks Ready for a 'Revenge Travel' Rally\n\nStory continues\n\nI therefore believe investors can consider exposure to oversold growth stocks. Once market sentiments turn bullish, returns from these picks can be robust.\n\nXPEV XPeng $23.25 TLRY Tilray $4.96 LAC Lithium Americas $26.23 BLNK Blink Charging $18.29 PATH UiPath $17.82 COIN Coinbase $116.60 KGC Kinross Gold $4.95\n\nXPeng (XPEV) Image of Xpeng's (XPEV) G3 electric SUV outside a mall in China\n\nSource: Johnnie Rik / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith Covid-19-triggered supply chain issues, Chinese electric vehicle (EV) stocks have witnessed a sharp correction. XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) stock has declined by almost 50% in the last six-months. I see this as a good opportunity to accumulate for the long-term.\n\nFor year-to-date 2022, XPeng reported vehicle deliveries of 43,563. On a year-over-year (YOY) basis, deliveries have surged by 136%. In April 2022, deliveries declined by 42% on a monthly basis. However, this drop due to supply chain issues is temporary and discounted in the stock.\n\nIt’s worth noting XPeng commenced mass-delivery of its P5 sedan in October 2021. Furthermore, in the third quarter of 2022, the company plans to start deliveries of G9. The launch of new vehicles will support growth along with expansion in European markets.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, XPeng reported $6.8 billion in cash and equivalents as of Q4 2021. On top of that, the company recently secured 7.5 billion renminbi in credit facility from the Agricultural Bank of China. The company has ample financial flexibility to pursue aggressive growth and invest in product development.\n\nOverall, XPEV stock trades at attractive valuations. Once industry sentiments improve, the stock can quickly double.\n\nTilray (TLRY) Mobile phone with webpage of Canadian cannabis company Tilray (TLRY) Inc. on screen in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nGradually, more states in the U.S. are legalizing recreational cannabis. Furthermore, federal-level legalization of marijuana remains a possibility. However, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) has remained depressed and trades below $5.\n\nI see current levels as a good buying opportunity. TLRY stock is one of the top names to consider among growth stocks in the cannabis segment.\n\nIt’s worth noting that for the first nine months of 2022, Tilray reported revenue of $475 million. This would imply an annualized revenue potential of $633 million.\n\nIn August 2021, the company CEO guided for revenue of $4 billion by 2024. With organic and inorganic growth, this seems likely. In particular, if regulatory headwinds wane in the coming quarters.\n\nTherefore, Tilray is positioned for healthy growth and the company has already been reporting positive adjusted EBITDA. With operating leverage, key margins should improve further in the next few years.\n\n7 Safe Stocks to Buy in May 2022\n\nTLRY stock therefore seems very attractive after a downside of 69% in the last 12 months. Once industry sentiments change, there can be a case for multifold returns.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrom its 52-week high of $41.56, Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) stock has corrected by nearly 40% to current levels around $25. These are attractive prices for accumulation considering the company’s long-term growth potential.\n\nAs an overview, the company has 100% ownership in the largest known lithium resources in the United States. With a mine life of 46 years, it expects to deliver an average annual EBITDA of $520 million. Clearly, the asset is a gamechanger with a post-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 29.3%.\n\nLithium Americas also has 44.8% ownership in the Caucharí-Olaroz project in Argentina. It is expected to deliver an average annual EBITDA of $308 million. Production in the asset is likely to commence in the second half of 2022. This is a key upside catalyst for LAC stock.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, the company has cash and equivalents of $500 million. There is ample flexibility to finance the construction phase of the Thacker Pass project. With lithium prices in an uptrend, the company is positioned to deliver healthy cash flows once assets are in the production phase. Therefore, financing growth through debt or equity should not be a concern.\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) a blink charging station\n\nSource: David Tonelson/Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobally, investments in EV charging infrastructure have been ramping up. In February 2022, President Joe Biden’s administration rolled out a plan to allocate $5 billion to states for EV charging station development.\n\nEven in Europe, there is significant investment due. Estimates suggest the region needs 65 million EV chargers by 2035. With industry tailwinds that are likely to last beyond the decade, related companies are among the best growth stocks to consider. Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) is one of the most appealing names to consider in this category — especially after a 48% correction in the last 12 months.\n\nFor 2021, Blink reported revenue of $20.9 million. On a YOY basis, revenue surged by 236%. With aggressive investments and acquisitions, healthy growth is likely to sustain.\n\nIt’s worth noting the company derived 36% of its revenue from outside the U.S. However, that’s likely to change as Blink makes inroads in Europe. Recently, the company acquired EB Charging, which provides EV charging infrastructure in the U.K. With a presence in 23 countries, Blink Charging is positioned for healthy top-line growth.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that as charging infrastructure expands, the company’s service revenue will swell. This will help boost its EBITDA margin.\n\n7 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in May and Hold for Years\n\nOverall, it seems the correction is over for BLNK stock. With major investments due in EV charging, the company is well-positioned to benefit.\n\nUiPath (PATH) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website homepage of UiPath (PATH).\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) is another name among growth stocks that is trading at attractive valuations. PATH stock has trended lower by almost 69% in the last six months.\n\nRecently, UiPath appointed Robert Enslin as its co-CEO. The company also reaffirmed its guidance for 2022. It expects revenue of nearly $1.1 billion and annual recurring revenue (ARR) of approximately $1.2 billion.\n\nEstimates from Forrester indicate the global automation market is likely to be worth $60 billion in the next few years. This positions UiPath for sustained growth in ARR and EBITDA margin expansion.\n\nThe company’s automation cloud has also been delivering encouraging numbers. This business segment was launched about two years ago and already has an ARR of $140 million.\n\nOverall, UiPath has witnessed strong customer growth on a YOY basis. The company’s non-GAAP operating margin also turned positive in 2022. With a big addressable market, it is positioned for sustained growth. PATH stock therefore is at an appealing entry point after a deep correction.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) COIN stock Coinbase logo on screen with Bitcoin coins\n\nSource: 24K-Production / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith Bitcoin (BTC-USD) struggling below $40,000 and lower trading activity, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) has been in correction mode. After a drop of 66% in the last six months, the stock looks like a potential buy at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 30x.\n\nFor 2021, Coinbase reported revenue of $7.4 billion and an adjusted EBITDA $4.1 billion. Even with multi-fold growth in both metrics, the stock has remained depressed. A key reason is expectations of meaningfully slower growth in 2022. That seems likely, but COIN stock sellers seem to have overreacted.\n\nIt’s worth noting that in 2021, Coinbase increased its number of institutional customers by 50%. With rising adoption from this group, the company is positioned to benefit. It also generated $500 million in subscription and services revenue for 2021. This includes sales from staking and custody, and is another potential source of sustained growth.\n\nAnother important point to note is that 68% of transactional revenue for Q4 2021 was from assets other than Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH-USD). With more assets being listed on the platform, the revenue stream is diversified.\n\n7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy for a Robust Retirement\n\nOverall, COIN stock is likely to make a strong comeback once there is a fresh breakout for Bitcoin. The stock looks undervalued considering the long-term growth outlook.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith inflation at a 40-year high, it makes sense to hold gold mining stocks in your portfolio. Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) is a relatively smaller name in the industry that still looks solid. At a forward P/E ratio of 11.7x, KGC stock has the potential to double in the next few quarters.\n\nLast month, Kinross sold Russian assets for a consideration of $680 million. The company also announced the sale of its Chirano mine in Ghana for $225 million. These sales have boosted its financial flexibility to pursue aggressive production growth from core assets.\n\nFor 2021, Kinross reported gold production of 2.07 million ounces. For 2022 and the coming year, it expects to produce 2.65 million ounces and 2.8 million ounces of gold, respectively.\n\nWith higher production visibility and gold trading around $1,900 per ounce, revenue and cash flow upside are likely to be robust. And while there is a case for multiple rate hikes in 2022, real interest rates will still remain negative. This will ensure gold remains around $2,000 per ounce, making KGC stock a worthwhile bet.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

(TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC) (“Lithium Americas” or the “Company”) has reported financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nArgentina\n\nCaucharí-Olaroz\n\nConstruction is advancing with mechanical completion and commencement of commissioning targeted for the second half of 2022.\n\nAdditional resources continue to be added to accelerate and de-risk commissioning and ramp-up. 1,650 workers are on site with activities carried out as normal. 100% of the workforce have received at least two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. In early April 2022, the site achieved a milestone of 5,000,000 total person hours without a lost time injury. As of March 31, 2021, 82%, or $605 million, of the $741 million capital budget has been spent. Progress on the second stage expansion of 20,000 tonnes per annum (“tpa”) of lithium carbonate equivalent (“LCE”) continues to advance with additions to the technical leadership team and a drilling program underway.\n\nPastos Grandes\n\nOn January 25, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Millennial and the 100% owned Pastos Grandes project for total consideration of approximately $360 million.\n\nUnited States\n\nThacker Pass\n\nOn April 14, 2022, the Company submitted a formal application to the US Department of Energy for funding to be used at Thacker Pass through the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program. The Company continues to advance a feasibility study for Thacker Pass with targeted capacity of 40,000 tpa LCE and incorporating a second phase expansion to reach a targeted total capacity of 80,000 tpa LCE. Results of the feasibility study are expected in the second half of 2022. Construction of the Lithium Technical Development Center (LiTDC) in Reno is substantially complete and commissioning has commenced. LiTDC includes integrated testing process equipment that will replicate the Thacker Pass flowsheet from raw ore to final product. It will support ongoing optimization work, provide product samples for potential customers and partners and enable process test work on new target deposits. In February 2022, the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection issued the final key state-level environmental permits: Water Pollution Control Permit, Class II Air Quality Operating Permit and Mine and Exploration Reclamation Permits. An appeal on the Record of Decision continues to advance through a US Federal Court, with a ruling expected in Q3 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nCorporate\n\nAs at March 31, 2022, the Company had $492 million in cash and cash equivalents with an additional $75 million in available credit. On April 28, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire shares of Green Technology Metals Limited (ASX: GT1), a North American focused lithium exploration and development company with hard rock spodumene assets in north-west Ontario, Canada, in a private placement for total consideration of $10 million, or approximately 5% following closing of the share placement. In February 2022, the Company commenced the process to explore a separation of its US operations, through the creation of a standalone public company focused on the development of Thacker Pass.\n\nTECHNICAL INFORMATION\n\nThe Technical Information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Rene LeBlanc, PhD, SME, Chief Technical Officer of Lithium Americas, and a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.\n\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\n\nSelected consolidated financial information is presented as follows:\n\n(in US$ million except per share information) Quarter ended March 31, 2022 2021 $ $ Expenses (16.0) (8.8) Net loss (46.1) (10.0) Loss per share – basic (0.35) (0.09)\n\n(in US$ million) As at March 31, 2022 As at December 31, 2021 $ $ Cash and cash equivalents 492.3 510.6 Total assets 1,136.2 817.3 Total long-term liabilities (298.7) (272.8)\n\nIn Q1 2022, total assets increased primarily due to the acquisition of Millennial. Total long-term liabilities increased due to $50.3 million increase in fair value of convertible senior notes derivative liability, partially offset by repayment of $24.7 million limited recourse loan facility balance and accumulated interest.\n\nThe higher net loss in 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily attributable to $50.3 million loss on change in fair value of convertible notes derivative driven by an increase in market value of the Company’s shares partially offset by non-cash gain on modification of the Company’s financial instruments.\n\nThis news release should be read in conjunction with Lithium Americas’ condensed consolidated interim financial statements and management's discussion and analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2022, which are available on the Company’s website and SEDAR.

"2022-05-04T20:56:00+00:00","NACCO INDUSTRIES ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2022 RESULTS","First Quarter NACCO Consolidated Highlights:\n\nOperating profit increased to $14.9 million, up from $8.3 million in Q1 2021 primarily due to significantly improved earnings in the Minerals Management segment Net income increased to $12.6 million, up 40.4% from $9.0 million in Q1 2021  EBITDA increased to $21.4 million, up 48.0% from Q1 2021 Diluted earnings per share increased to $1.72/share from $1.25/share in Q1 2021\n\nCLEVELAND, May 4, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- NACCO Industries® (NYSE: NC) today announced consolidated operating profit of $14.9 million and net income of $12.6 million, or $1.72 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2022 compared with consolidated operating profit of $8.3 million and net income of $9.0 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2021.\n\nImprovements in the Company's consolidated operating profit, Consolidated EBITDA and net income were due to significantly higher earnings in the Minerals Management segment. Improvements in the North American Mining segment were offset by lower earnings in the Coal Mining segment and an increase in unallocated business development and employee-related expenses. Non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled on pages 9 and 10.\n\nEffective January 1, 2022, the Company changed the composition of its reportable segments. As a result, the Company retrospectively changed its computation of segment operating profit to reclassify the results of Caddo Creek Resources Company and Demery Resources Company from the Coal Mining segment into the North American Mining segment as these operations provide mining solutions for producers of industrial minerals, rather than for power generation. The Coal Mining segment now includes only mines that deliver coal for power generation. This segment reporting change has no impact on consolidated operating results. All prior period segment information in this release has been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. The reclassified segment financial information for the 2021 four quarters and full year has also been provided on pages 10 to 12 of this release.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt March 31, 2022, the Company had consolidated cash of $81.6 million and debt of $25.5 million with availability of $113.9 million under its $150.0 million revolving credit facility. The Company believes that maintaining a conservative capital structure and adequate liquidity are important given evolving trends in energy markets and the Company's strategic initiatives to grow and diversify, which are discussed further in the Growth and Diversification section of this release.\n\nDetailed Discussion of Results\r\nCoal Mining Results\n\nCoal deliveries for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 were as follows: 2022 2021 Tons of coal delivered (in thousands) Unconsolidated operations 6,317 7,510 Consolidated operations 732 835 Total deliveries 7,049 8,345 Key financial results for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 were as follows: 2022 2021 (in thousands) Revenues $ 20,962 $ 21,942 Earnings of unconsolidated operations $ 13,326 $ 14,162 Operating expenses(1) $ 8,086 $ 7,857 Operating profit $ 7,352 $ 8,157 Segment EBITDA(2) $ 11,390 $ 12,312\n\n(1) Operating expenses consist of Selling, general and administrative expenses, Amortization of intangible assets and (Gain) loss on sale of assets. (2) Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP. See non-GAAP explanation and the related reconciliations to GAAP on page 10.\n\nCoal Mining revenues decreased in the first quarter of 2022 from the first quarter of 2021 primarily due to fewer tons delivered as a result of lower customer demand at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company.\n\nFirst-quarter 2022 Coal Mining operating profit and Segment EBITDA decreased from the prior year quarter mainly due to a decrease in earnings of unconsolidated operations and higher operating expenses.\n\nThe decrease in earnings of unconsolidated operations was primarily attributable to the termination of the Bisti Fuels contract on September 30, 2021, a reduction in fees earned at Liberty as the scope of final mine reclamation activities continues to decline and lower customer requirements at Sabine. The decrease was partly offset by an increase in earnings at Coteau resulting from contractual price escalation. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to an increase in professional fees partially offset by lower employee-related costs.\n\nCoal Mining Outlook - 2022\n\nOn May 2, 2022, Great River Energy (""GRE"") completed the sale of the Coal Creek Station power plant and the adjacent high-voltage direct current transmission line to Rainbow Energy Center, LLC and its affiliates. As a result of the sale, the existing agreements between GRE and Falkirk Mining Company terminated and GRE paid the Company $14.0 million, transferred ownership of an office building and conveyed membership units in Midwest AgEnergy to NACCO. The new Coal Sales Agreement (""CSA"") between Falkirk and Rainbow Energy became effective on May 1, 2022. Falkirk will continue supplying all coal requirements of Coal Creek Station and will be paid a management fee per ton of coal delivered for operating the mine. Rainbow Energy is responsible for funding all mine operating costs and directly or indirectly providing all of the capital required to operate the mine. The CSA specifies that Falkirk will perform final mine reclamation, which will be funded in its entirety by Rainbow Energy. The initial production period is expected to run ten years from the effective date of the CSA, but the CSA may be extended or terminated early under certain circumstances.\n\nCoal Mining operating profit in 2022 is expected to decrease significantly compared with 2021, both including and excluding the contract termination fees. The expected reduction in operating profit is primarily the result of reduced earnings at both consolidated and unconsolidated Coal Mining operations as well as an anticipated increase in operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to expected higher outside services and professional fees.\n\nResults at the consolidated mining operations are expected to decrease significantly in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to expected substantially lower earnings at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company driven by an anticipated reduction in customer demand, predominantly in the second half of 2022, from higher than average levels in 2021. Lower customer demand, expected cost inflation in 2022 on diesel fuel, repairs and supplies, and higher depreciation expense related to recent capital expenditures to develop a new mine area are expected to contribute to an increase in the cost per ton in 2022. In general, cost per ton delivered is lowest when the power plant requires a consistently high level of coal deliveries, primarily because costs are spread over more tons.\n\nThe reduction in earnings at the unconsolidated Coal Mining operations is expected to be driven by the termination of the Bisti Fuels contract as of September 30, 2021 and lower earnings at Falkirk, primarily in the second half of 2022 compared with the second half of 2021. Falkirk has agreed to a reduction in the current per ton management fee from May 1, 2022 through May 31, 2024. After May 31, 2024, Falkirk's per ton management fee increases to a higher base in line with current fee levels, and thereafter adjusts annually according to an index which tracks a broad measure of U.S. inflation.\n\nSegment EBITDA, which excludes the termination payments of $10.3 million from Bisti Fuels' customer in 2021 and the $14 million contract termination fee from GRE in 2022, is expected to decrease significantly in 2022 from 2021 primarily as a result of the forecasted reduction in operating profit partially offset by an increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense is primarily due to higher capital expenditures at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company as a result of the development of a new mine area.\n\nCapital expenditures are expected to be approximately $21 million in 2022. The elevated levels of capital expenditures from 2019 through 2022 relate to the necessary development of a new mine area at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company, which will allow continued coal deliveries through the end of the contract. The increase in capital expenditures associated with mine development will result in higher depreciation expense in future periods that will unfavorably affect future operating profit. Capital expenditures for Mississippi Lignite Mining Company are expected to decline significantly beginning in 2023.\n\nThe Company's contract structure at each of its coal mining operations eliminates exposure to spot coal market price fluctuations. However, fluctuations in natural gas prices and the availability of renewable power generation, particularly wind, can contribute to changes in power plant dispatch and customer demand for coal. Sustained higher natural gas prices could continue to result in increased demand for coal. Changes to expectations for customer power plant dispatch could affect the Company's outlook for 2022 and over the longer term.\n\nThe owner of the power plant served by the Company's Sabine Mine in Texas intends to retire the power plant in the first quarter of 2023, at which time Sabine expects to begin final reclamation. Funding for mine reclamation is the responsibility of the customer. Coteau operates the Freedom Mine in North Dakota. All coal production from the Freedom Mine is delivered to Basin Electric Power Cooperative. Basin Electric utilizes the coal at the Great Plains Synfuels Plant, Antelope Valley Station and Leland Olds Station. The Synfuels Plant is a coal gasification plant owned by Dakota Gas that manufactures synthetic natural gas and produces fertilizers, solvents, phenol, carbon dioxide and other chemical products for sale. In August 2021, Basin Electric announced that it signed a non-binding term sheet which contemplates the sale of the assets of Dakota Gas. The closing is subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions. As part of the announcement, Basin Electric indicated that the Synfuels Plant will continue existing operations through 2026. Basin Electric is also considering other options for the Synfuels Plant if the transaction with the potential buyer does not close.\n\nNorth American Mining Results\n\nDeliveries for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 were as follows: 2022 2021 (in thousands) Tons delivered 13,962 12,675 Key financial results for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 were as follows: 2022 2021 (in thousands) Revenues $ 21,404 $ 17,939 Operating profit  $ 1,271 $ 657 Segment EBITDA(1) $ 2,738 $ 1,608\n\n(1) Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP. See non-GAAP explanation and the related reconciliations to GAAP on page 10.\n\nRevenues at North American Mining increased in the first quarter of 2022 over the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in tons delivered driven by increased customer requirements. Higher revenue related to reclamation at Caddo Creek also contributed to the increase in revenues.\n\nThe improvement in operating profit was due to higher reclamation income at Caddo Creek partly offset by a reduction in earnings at the active operations primarily as a result of higher employee-related costs.\n\nNorth American Mining Segment EBITDA increased significantly as a result of the increase in operating profit and substantially higher depreciation expense resulting from equipment acquired to support newer contracts that are expected to contribute to increased income in future periods.\n\nNorth American Mining Outlook\n\nIn 2022, North American Mining expects full-year operating profit to increase over 2021, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2022, due to an expected increase in customer requirements and contributions from contracts executed during 2021. Segment EBITDA for 2022 is expected to increase significantly compared with the prior year as a result of the improvement in operating profit and an increase in depreciation expense.\n\nDuring 2021, North American Mining expanded its footprint, including into new geographies, by entering into new contract mining services agreements at quarries in Florida, Indiana, Texas and Arkansas. During the first quarter of 2022, North American Mining agreed to commission a new dragline at an existing quarry in Florida to secure a contract extension through 2027. This dragline will supplement an existing dragline at this operation, resulting in an expected increase in deliveries and income over the next five years at the quarry. North American Mining continues to have a substantial pipeline of potential new projects and is pursuing a number of growth initiatives that, if successful, would be accretive to future earnings.\n\nIn 2019, North American Mining's subsidiary, Sawtooth Mining, LLC, entered into a mining services agreement to serve as the exclusive contract miner for the Thacker Pass lithium project in northern Nevada, owned by Lithium Nevada Corp., a subsidiary of Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC). Lithium Americas owns the lithium reserves at Thacker Pass and will be responsible for the processing and sale of the lithium produced. In April 2022, Lithium Americas provided an update on the Thacker Pass project, which noted that all key state-level permits had been issued for Thacker Pass and early-works construction, which includes site access and preparation, is expected to commence in 2022. At maturity, this management fee contract is expected to deliver fee income similar to a mid-sized management fee coal mine.\n\nIn 2022, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $28 million primarily for the acquisition, relocation and refurbishment of draglines, as well as the acquisition of other mining equipment to support the continued expansion of contract-mining services, including the acquisition of equipment to support the Thacker Pass lithium project. The cost of mining equipment related to Thacker Pass will be reimbursed by the customer over a seven-year period from the equipment acquisition date.\n\nMinerals Management Results\n\nKey financial results for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 were as follows: 2022 2021 (in thousands) Revenues  $ 12,754 $ 5,500 Operating profit  $ 11,628 $ 4,235 Segment EBITDA(1) $ 12,206 $ 4,682\n\n(1) Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP. See non-GAAP explanation and the related reconciliations to GAAP on page 10.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2022, Minerals Management revenue, operating profit and Segment EBITDA increased significantly over the first quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher royalty income driven by significantly higher natural gas and oil prices, as well as $2.1 million of settlement income recognized during the first quarter of 2022. The settlement income relates to the Company's ownership interest in certain mineral rights.\n\nMinerals Management Outlook\n\nThe Minerals Management segment derives income from royalty-based leases under which lessees make payments to the Company based on their sale of natural gas, oil, natural gas liquids and coal, extracted primarily by third parties.\n\nOperating profit and Segment EBITDA in 2022 are expected to increase significantly over 2021 primarily driven by current expectations for natural gas and oil prices for the remainder of 2022, partly offset by an anticipated reduction in production. As a result of substantially higher oil and natural gas prices in the first half of 2022 compared with the respective prior year period, the Company expects a significant increase in operating profit in the first half of 2022. This increase is anticipated to be partly offset by a modest decrease in the second half of 2022 as increases in oil and gas prices are expected to moderate and as a result of the absence of $3.3 million of settlement income recognized in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nCommodity prices are inherently volatile and as an owner of royalty and mineral interests, the Company's access to information concerning activity and operations with respect to its interests is limited. The Company's expectations are based on the best information currently available and could vary positively or negatively as a result of adjustments made by operators and/or changes to commodity prices.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, Minerals Management completed a small acquisition of mineral interests in the New Mexico portion of the Permian basin for $0.7 million. Minerals Management is targeting additional investments in mineral and royalty interests of approximately $9 million in the remainder of 2022. These investments are expected to be accretive, but each investment's contribution to earnings is dependent on the details of that investment, including the size and type of interests acquired and the stage and timing of mineral development. The contribution of each investment could also vary due to commodity price changes. These acquired interests are expected to align with the Company's strategy of selectively acquiring mineral and royalty interests with a balance of near-term cash-flow yields and long-term growth potential, in high-quality reservoirs offering diversification from the Company's legacy mineral interests.\n\nConsolidated 2022 Outlook\n\nOverall for the 2022 full year, excluding the settlements associated with the GRE/Rainbow Energy transaction and the Bisti termination fee recognized in 2021, NACCO expects consolidated operating profit, net income and Consolidated EBITDA to decrease from 2021. Lower operating profit in the Coal Mining segment is expected to be partially offset by an anticipated significant increase in earnings at the Minerals Management segment and higher operating profit at North American Mining. In addition, the Company recognized $3.4 million of gains associated with equity securities in 2021 that are not expected to recur. The effective income tax rate, including the settlements associated with the GRE/Rainbow Energy transaction is expected to be between 14% and 16%.\n\nThe Company will recognize the value of the North Dakota office building and the membership units in Midwest AgEnergy received as part of the settlement with GRE as a component of other income.\n\nConsolidated capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $67 million in 2022 and include approximately $8 million for expenditures at Mitigation Resources of North America®. In 2022, cash flow before financing activities is expected to be significantly lower than in 2021 as a result of the anticipated capital expenditures.\n\nGrowth and Diversification\n\nThe Company is pursuing growth and diversification by strategically leveraging its core mining and natural resources management skills to build a strong portfolio of affiliated businesses. Management continues to be optimistic about the long-term outlook for growth in the North American Mining and Minerals Management segments and in the Company's Mitigation Resources of North America business. Each of these businesses continues to expand its pipeline of potential new projects with opportunities for growth and diversification.\n\nNorth American Mining is pursuing growth and diversification by expanding the scope of its business development activities to include potential customers who require a broad range of minerals and materials and by leveraging the Company's core mining skills to expand the range of contract mining services it provides. North American Mining continues to pursue additional opportunities to provide comprehensive mining services to operate entire mines, as it expects to do at the new lithium project in Nevada. The goal is to build North American Mining into a leading provider of contract mining services for customers that produce a wide variety of minerals and materials. The Company believes North American Mining can grow to be a substantial contributor to operating profit, delivering unlevered after-tax returns on invested capital in the mid-teens as this business model matures and achieves significant scale, but the pace of growth will be dependent on the mix and scale of new projects.\n\nThe Minerals Management segment continues to grow and diversify by pursuing acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests in the United States. The Minerals Management segment will benefit from the continued development of its mineral properties without additional capital investment, as all further development costs are borne entirely by third-party producers who lease the minerals. This business model can deliver higher average operating margins over the life of a reserve than traditional oil and gas companies that bear the cost of exploration, production and/or development. Catapult Mineral Partners, the Company's business unit focused on managing and expanding the Company's portfolio of oil and gas mineral and royalty interests, has developed a strong network to source and secure new acquisitions, and has several potential acquisitions under review. The goal is to construct a diversified portfolio of high-quality oil and gas mineral and royalty interests in the United States that deliver near-term cash flow yields and long-term projected growth. The Company believes this business will provide unlevered after-tax returns on invested capital in the low-to-mid-teens as the portfolio of reserves and mineral interests grows and this business model matures.\n\nMitigation Resources of North America continues to expand its business, which creates and sells stream and wetland mitigation credits and provides services to those engaged in permittee-responsible mitigation. This business offers an opportunity for growth and diversification in an industry where the Company has substantial knowledge and expertise and a strong reputation. The Mitigation Resources business has achieved several early successes and is positioned for additional growth. The Company's goal is to grow Mitigation Resources into one of the ten largest U.S. providers of mitigation solutions, largely focused on streams and wetlands, initially in the southeast United States. While this business is in the early stages of development, it is currently focused on expanding and has established mitigation projects in Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and Tennessee. The Company believes that Mitigation Resources can provide solid rates of return as this business matures.\n\nThe Company also continues to pursue activities which can strengthen the resiliency of its existing coal mining operations. The Company remains focused on managing coal production costs and maximizing efficiencies and operating capacity at mine locations to help customers with management fee contracts be more competitive. These activities benefit both customers and the Company's Coal Mining segment, as fuel cost is a significant driver for power plant dispatch. Increased power plant dispatch results in increased demand for coal by the Coal Mining segment's customers. Fluctuating natural gas prices and availability of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, could affect the amount of electricity dispatched from coal-fired power plants.\n\nThe Company continues to look for opportunities to expand its coal mining business where it can apply its management fee business model to assume operation of existing surface coal mining operations in the United States. However, opportunities are very limited in the current environment. In addition, the political and regulatory environment is not receptive to development of new coal-fired power generation projects which would create opportunities to build and operate new coal mines.\n\nThe Company is committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure as it continues to grow and diversify, while avoiding unnecessary risk. Strategic diversification will generate cash that can be re-invested to strengthen and expand the businesses. The Company also continues to maintain the highest levels of customer service and operational excellence with an unwavering focus on safety and environmental stewardship.\n\n****\n\nConference Call\n\nIn conjunction with this news release, the management of NACCO Industries will host a conference call on Thursday, May 5, 2022 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Lithium Americas (LAC): To meet its electric vehicle (EV) goals, the Biden administration has to enable more lithium mines to open in the U.S., and the company is looking to open a large lithium mine in Nevada. Cleveland Cliffs (CLF): The steelmaker is benefiting from price hikes and strong demand from the automotive sector. construction workers point at mining equipment in the near distance\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWith the manufacturing sector still showing tremendous strength, and the U.S. government about to pour a large amount of funding into the country’s infrastructure, it’s a good time to focus on materials stocks. All of this is going on along with the ongoing energy transition, whose momentum is rapidly accelerating and will help the sector.\n\nAdditionally, because the value of many materials is determined by Wall Street traders, increases in inflation expectations generally cause the prices of these commodities to jump relatively quickly. Consequently, buying materials stocks is a good way to hedge against inflation.\n\n7 Dividend Stocks Paying Over 5% to Buy Now\n\nWith that in mind, let’s dive in and take a closer look at these three materials stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCOPX Global X Copper Miners ETF $40.25 LAC Lithium Americas $25.42 CLF Cleveland Cliffs $27.87\n\nMaterials Stocks to Buy: Global X Copper Miners ETF (COPX) Piece of copper set against black background\n\nSource: Coldmoon Photoproject/Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a result of the bipartisan infrastructure law, the U.S. government will spend a great deal of money on “electrification for infrastructure, buildings, and fleets of government vehicles.” This, along with Washington looking to electrify its busses, means there will be a higher need for EV chargers. And since copper is the primary means of conducting electricity, the demand for the metal is likely to jump once the federal government starts getting large amounts of money appropriated by the infrastructure law out the door later this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat, of course, is good news for copper miners. However, it is a good, low-risk way to play that trend is through the Global X Copper Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:COPX).\n\nOverall, copper is used extensively in renewable energy. And as Europe accelerates its transition to renewable energy, China also quickly adds new solar and wind projects and many other countries rapidly embrace this energy revolution, copper prices should climb.\n\nIn recent days, amid worries about China’s new novel coronavirus lockdowns and the Federal Reserves’ interest rate hikes, COPX stock has fallen sharply. However, the decline has just created a good buying opportunity for investors looking for the top materials stocks.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) a lithium mine\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTo meet its aspirations in the energy sector, the U.S. needs to raise its supply of lithium tremendously. And to accomplish the latter goal, President Joe Biden’s administration will have to enable American companies to open lithium mines relatively quickly, despite opposition to the mines from some Native Americans and environmental activists.\n\nRight now, lithium-ion batteries are currently being used to power most electric vehicles. Moreover, such batteries are also increasingly being utilized to store electricity.\n\n7 Oversold Stocks to Scoop Up in May 2022\n\nIn turn, this bodes well for Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC), which is seeking to launch a large lithium mine in Nevada. According to its CEO, construction on the site could begin in late 2022. Given the high priority the Biden administration places on putting more EVs on America’s roads, the company will likely be able to meet that timetable. And with the demand for lithium exploding, the company will probably be extremely profitable two or three years down the road.\n\nMaterials Stocks to Buy: Cleveland Cliffs (CLF) the Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF stock) logo displayed on a web browser and magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn a previous column, I cited contract renewals and strong demand from the automotive sector amidst the EV revolution as two reasons to be bullish on CLF stock.\n\nIn conjunction with its first-quarter results unveiled on April 22, the company stated that it is indeed greatly benefiting from those two trends. More specifically, Cleveland Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) CEO Celso Goncalves reported that the company had signed hefty ” fixed contract price increases that went into effect at the beginning of this calendar year 2022.”\n\nFurthermore, on the automotive front, the steelmaker generated ” a 200,000 ton improvement [versus the previous quarter) in direct volumes to the automotive industry.” In fact, Goncalves noted that Q1 was Cleveland Cliffs’ “best shipment quarter to [the auto sector] since the semiconductor shortage began in the first quarter of last year.”\n\nOverall, Cleveland Cliffs Q1 EBITDA, excluding certain items, soared 300% year-over-year to $1.5 billion, while its adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months that ended in March 2022 came in at $6.2 billion. The latter metric was “s a record for any 12-month period in our company’s history,” Goncalves stated.\n\nThe steelmaker will continue benefiting from the high prices that it obtained in its new contracts and from the EV revolution. Meanwhile, CLF stock is trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of just 4.7.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

"2022-04-28T16:11:23+00:00","10 Best Lithium Stocks To Buy Now","In this article, we will look at 10 best lithium stocks to buy now. If you want to skip reading about how and why lithium prices are skyrocketing, you can go directly to 5 Best Lithium Stock To Buy Now.\n\nLithium prices are rallying during the EV boom. As concerns about climate change and global warming alarm governments to take action, and the global economy transitions to electrified transport and abandons combustion engines, the demand for lithium is bound to skyrocket. The biggest industrial application of lithium as of now is its use in powertrains of electric vehicles. Every big player in the automobile manufacturing industry has announced its plans to go all-electric at some point in the future, with some targeting achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2035, and others planning all-electric fleets by 2050. Lithium manufacturers and miners are looking at lucrative days ahead, as the demand for lithium grows catalyzed by global EV adoption.\n\nGlobal EV Adoption\n\nAccording to Statista, even though a semiconductor shortage resulted in a rough year for the automobile industry in 2021, global electric vehicle sales saw a two-fold increase compared to 2020, peaking at 6.6 million up from 3 million. According to the EV volumes data, cited by the International Energy Agency, all net growth in global car sales in 2021 can be attributed to EVs. China was leading in 2021 having almost tripled electric car sales from 1.2 to 3.4 million. Europe was the runner-up region that reported new car registrations up by 70% from 2020, hitting 2.3 million, roughly half of which had electric powertrains. For the first time in history, new car sales crossed 1 million in the United States, and more than half of which were electric cars.\n\nStrong Demand For Lithium Ahead\n\nAccording to S&P Global Commodity Insights, the demand for lithium is expected to further strengthen in 2022. S&P Global Platts data shows that seaborne lithium carbonate prices went up by 413% in 2021 and hit $32,600 per metric ton last December. Lithium hydroxide prices gained 254% over the same period to reach $31,900 per metric ton. Lithium chemical supply is expected to hit 636,000 metric tons, up from roughly 497,000 metric tons in 2021. The demand for lithium is forecasted to grow to 641,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2022, up from 504,000 metric tons in 2021. This creates a deficit of 5,000 metric tons, down from a deficit of 8,000 metric tons in 2021, and according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, this deficit is expected to drive lithium prices to record highs in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoaring lithium prices have resulted in EV manufacturers pondering about creating their own lithium power plants. This April, a tweet highlighted the exponential growth of the price of lithium from $4,450 per tonne in 2012 to $78,032 per tonne as of April 2022. Shortly after, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), was reported to be talking about exploring opportunities for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to get into mining and refining lithium on its own unless prices for the commodity relax.\n\nProminent names in the lithium industry include Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS), and Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo determine the 10 best lithium stocks to buy now we looked for companies that are continually making progress with expansions of their facilities and are racing to become the go-to suppliers for major EV companies.

If you want to read about some more lithium stocks available at bargain prices, go directly to 5 Cheap Lithium Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nLithium is one of the hottest sectors of the market as demand far outstrips supply. As electric vehicle (EV) adoption increases, the lithium market is expected to strengthen even further in 2022. Data from S&P Global indicates that prices for seaborne lithium carbonate climbed more than 400% in 2021. S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that lithium chemical supply is forecast to reach 636,000 mt lithium carbonate equivalent in 2022. In 2020 and 2021, this figure stood at around 408,000 mt and 497,000 mt, respectively.\n\nAs lithium becomes a sought-after commodity, the fight over control of the resource is also growing. A spokesperson of Chinese mining firm Tianqi Lithium told S&P Global Platts that it was becoming more difficult to obtain and control lithium resources as the “strategic significance” of the material grew. Global EV sales are also increasing and therefore lifting the lithium industry. Platts Analytics estimates that light-duty EV sales will rise to 10.5 million units by 2025, up from 6 million units in 2021.\n\nAmid this boom, several lithium firms are seeking to boost capacity to meet surging demand. Lithium demand will climb over 30% by 2025, per conservative estimates. Investors seeking to profit from this activity should consider the best lithium stocks in the EV space. Some of the top stocks in the EV sector presently include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe companies that are trading at relatively cheap prices compared to their growth potential were selected for the list.

The volume of contracts sold at each strike corresponds to the size of the equity position we want should the calls expire in the money, and the underlying equity gets called away from us. The thought process behind this trade construction is that if we know the size of the position we want at a particular price point, there is no reason not to accumulate additional returns by pre-selling the stock we would have sold anyway.\n\nHigh levels of volatility positively impact the price of options, increasing the premium we can earn from selling covered calls. To date, we have sold covered calls on Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) that have expired worthless four times, yielding a roughly 7% return on the equity position’s current value or 71bps for the portfolio overall. The outstanding covered calls appear to be trending towards a similar worthless expiration. If they do, the covered call trades on Lithium Americas Corp.

The company went public via a SPAC in November. After rapid appreciation, the stock came under pressure when the company raised additional capital to help accelerate its commercialization process.

"2022-04-13T00:01:00+00:00","Unprecedented Helium Shortage Could Send Prices Sky-High","Worth 100x more than natural gas, the shale boom has taken on a new angle for exploration and production, with the critical level of helium supplies igniting a land rush that could determine the future of innovation itself.\n\nThe bulk of the world’s helium reserves are found in natural gas fields, which means that these fields now have double the potential–and double the interest from a national security perspective.\n\nNon-renewable and irreplaceable, helium is a critical element in hard drives, supercomputing, scientific research, space travel, and even medical MRIs.\n\nSupply is now at a critical level, and the Russian war on Ukraine is compounding the supply crunch, stripping us of more global helium resources as the natural gas it is extracted with is hurriedly shipped off to Europe to stave off a crisis without stripping and liquifying the helium.\n\nFor North America, which until recently enjoyed a stable supply of helium through the Federal Helium Reserve in Amarillo, Texas, there is an opportunity for anyone who can bring helium back home.\n\nIn our view, the advantage here goes to Total Helium(TSX.V:TOH; OTC: TTLHF) the owner of a large helium play in the Kansas-Oklahoma panhandle that has already started producing and enjoys a lucrative offtake agreement with one of the biggest members of the helium oligopoly”–the $160-billion behemoth, Linde Plc (NYSE:LIN).\n\nTotal Helium’s wildcatter team jumped on the helium prospects in the largest U.S. gas field before others saw the potential supply squeeze looming.\n\nNow, it’s not only started producing, but it’s also ready to sell, and it’s expanding its helium holdings, fast, with an eye to grabbing as much market share as it can against the backdrop of a major helium shortage that has seen prices upwards of $500 Mcf–again, more than 100x the price of natural gas.\n\nFirst to market may be the biggest beneficiary of a helium boom. Right now, our pick is Total Helium.\n\nHere are 5 reasons to keep a close eye on Total Helium right now:\n\nStory continues\n\n#1 Hugoton: Why This Massive Gas Field Is Back on Everyone’s Radar\n\nSo far, Total Helium (TSX.V:TOH; OTC: TTLHF) has amassed approximately 115,000 acres of leases on hand at Hugoton, the largest gas field in the United States. Half of that acreage is in the form of farmout agreements with Scout Energy, one of the largest producers in the basin.\n\nThis land has proven helium concentrations …\n\nAnd Total Helium is targeting 70 billion cubic feet of helium here, along with 8.5 trillion cubic feet of produced gas.\n\n#2 The Wildcatters Surprising Everyone from Africa to North America\n\nTotal Helium brought new technology into Hugoton while everyone else appeared to be distracted by the non-conventional opportunities; in other words, the shale boom.\n\nAfter getting at the easy natural gas in Hugoton historically, not to mention some 300 BCF of helium, the shale boom drew attention away from this massive field. Even though conventional, its huge remaining resources were too expensive to extract due to the high water content. That water has to go somewhere–and it has to do so economically.\n\nTotal Helium, backed by Craig Steinke of Reconnaissance Energy Africa (Recon Africa), was up for the challenge. This wildcatter has a reputation for going where no one else is paying attention and drumming up big discoveries and even bigger opportunities. It was small-cap Recon Africa, after all, that went on a super-sized expedition to Namibia and came back with the discovery of a working petroleum system in the giant Kavango Basin. That may end up being the last big onshore oil discovery in the world, and now, with Total Helium, Steinke is once again backing a tiny company that’s aiming big.\n\nPutting the right technology in the right place and right before a supply squeeze–that’s Steinke’s modus operandi.\n\nThe right technology is always a matter of keeping costs down. Total Helium’s answer to Hugoton’s water problem is a de-watering tech that works best on huge zones. For every ten producing wells, the company intends to drill only a single salt-water disposal well. Those are some economics that investors can handle when they consider the Linde downstream partnership deal, the soaring price of helium, and the additional upside potential here.\n\n#3 Already Producing and Ready to Hit the Market\n\nWe think this could be one of the fastest production plays investors have seen in a long time.\n\nThe estimate is that Total Helium (TSX.V:TOH; OTC: TTLHF) could produce over 27,000 Mcf from each well.\n\nAfter drilling and completing its first two wells by January this year, Total Helium has already started producing. On March 15th it geared up to hit the market with its first helium and one of its upside offerings–methane.\n\nThis helium is in the pipeline and will likely hit Linde’s processing plant any day now, pending final processing agreements.\n\nThe agreement with Linde is a huge vote of confidence for investors. Linde has made pre-payment for Total Helium’s future helium production and advanced $950,000 prior to the first drill, and another $950,000 upon its completion.\n\nAnd it was all done at costs that we think make Total Helium’s margins quite attractive. Drilling completion costs come in at about $600,000, and the company’s net from 300 Mcf could result in a payout in as little as 18 months. A payout over this short of a time period is unheard of in the shale industry.\n\n*RPS Confident Person’s Report P50 Case\n\nWith Total Helium’s de-watering process, the company can take advantage of low drilling and completion costs because Hugoton is a shallow gas play. Costs can also be kept down because Total Helium doesn’t have to build its own processing facilities or transport infrastructure. It’s all there, and the agreement with giant Linde may be the perfect critical infrastructure setup.\n\n#4 Plans to Lock Up Loads of Helium Land\n\nSo what comes next?\n\nSince Hugoton is considered as one of the most important sources of helium in North America, Total Helium is looking to lock up as much land as possible in a planned expansion of up to 1.65-million-acres.\n\nThat could give this tiny company up to 19X its current helium land position.\n\nThis quarter, they’re planning to expand their developmental drilling and completion program, add more to the leasing campaign, and work out subsurface storage rights with giant Linde.\n\nThis isn’t just about producing helium and getting it to market …\n\nThere’s an innovative storage opportunity here, as well, and it offers potential upside that could add multiple layers to this play.\n\nThey plan to turn Hugoton into the next major American reserve.\n\nTotal Helium (TSX.V:TOH; OTC: TTLHF) is collaborating with a multinational industrial gas company to establish underground Helium storage rivaling the successor of the U.S. Federal Helium Reserve. Total Helium will operate the facility with 50-50% ownership.\n\nHelium storage is critical because this lightest of elements in the universe is non-renewable and once it is released into the air, it is lost in the atmosphere, forever.\n\nAnd it doesn’t plan to just store helium, either …\n\nIt intends to store hydrogen, another of the universe’s lightest elements. The hydrogen market is set to hit $300 billion by 2027, and storage here, too, will be critical in maintaining supply.\n\n#5 Qatar, Algeria, Australia … and Kansas\n\nFor a tiny company like Total Helium to lock up a deal with a member of the helium oligopoly is the kind of offtake deal that usually takes years for junior companies to achieve.\n\nLinde isn’t just a helium supplier. It’s much more than that. It enjoys a 40% global market share for helium, and it has operations on three continents, in Qatar, Algeria, Australia, and the United States. Its helium plant in Kansas is one of the biggest in the world.\n\nBeyond what is to come for Total Helium in the form of what could be the most advantageous downstream agreement a junior helium company may ever seek, it’s already locked in for over $2.2 million as a result, in both current and upcoming cash flow.\n\nIt also looks to have done wonders for Total Helium’s capex: This junior has the advantage of not having to spend tens of millions of dollars building up infrastructure such as pipelines and processing plants.\n\nWhat Total Helium has done so far is forward-thinking about the helium demand and supply equation.\n\nThis team could have a competitive advantage and is ahead of the competition because it didn’t wait for the helium supply squeeze to get critical after the Federal Helium Reserve announced it was winding down and auctioning off all the remaining helium, turning the rare gas into a free market game that other natural gas producers may not have been following.\n\nIt didn’t wait, either, until Russia launched a war on Ukraine and we saw our first global helium supplies suspended, in Algeria.\n\nInstead, this junior company started scooping up prospective helium land and looked to resolve Hugoton’s water challenges with new technology. That got Linde’s attention, and now that the first helium is already in the pipeline, with a proposed expansion underway, it could get everyone else’s attention, too.\n\nIn this play for a natural resource now critical to American national interest, the future of big data, supercomputing, fiber optic communications, and scientific research at large, Total Helium may be years ahead of the competition, and as soon as that first helium hits the market, it may no longer be pushing ahead off the radar.\n\nAmerica is desperate for home-grown helium, and Total Helium will deliver new supply, first.\n\nTech: The Industry Desperate For New Helium Supply\n\nFrom semiconductors to the internet as we know it, helium plays a vital role in the tech world.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) has a lengthy history and has helped shape many technologies we rely on today. It’s focus on high standards and its strive for excellence has led them into becoming one of Apple Inc.'s primary suppliers, helping assist Apple during a global semiconductor shortage.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is a particularly competitive industry and only five companies in the world own chip-making facilities, making Taiwan Semiconductor a standout in the industry.. Indeed, many leading top semiconductor companies are ""fabless,"" meaning they only design the chips but rely on other companies, known as foundries, to actually make the chips. The shift to outsourcing has been having a big effect on structural changes and related capacity because companies that cut orders in the early days of the pandemic have been forced to go to the back of the line.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is a key player to watch in both the helium shortage and the semiconductor shortage. As the world’s largest chipmaker, it needs helium to survive. And with a semiconductor supply squeeze looming, it could stand to benefit big when Big Tech comes knocking.\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the world’s most renowned chipmakers. It has been around since the late 1950's, when it was founded by Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore who first coined their portmanteau name- Integrated Electronics. Intel supplies processors for computer systems such as desktops laptop servers tablets mobile phones (including smartphones)and more; they also make motherboard chipsets that connect these devices together so you can use your processor effectively while having access to fast memory too.\n\nAt its core, Intel is a chipmaker. And a big one at that. It’s also a leader in the global semiconductor game thanks to its investments in 65nm process, an advanced node used in volume CMOS semiconductor fabrication. Intel has manufactured semiconductors in Ireland since 1990, and has invested around $6 billion there in this time, but is beginning to branch out with new investments in the United States, as well.\n\nConsidering that helium is a critical part of the semiconductor and computer chip manufacturing process, any outages or new discoveries could have an impact on chipmakers like Intel.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is at the cutting edge of the world of computing and graphics. It founded over forty years ago with a single mission: to advance technology as fast it could be invented. Since then, they've become one of the most relied upon brands for processing power – both at home on your own PC or game console; but also when you need high performance computer systems that can process data quickly enough maybe even live video streaming where every millisecond counts.\n\nAdvanced Media Devices isn’t just building home computers, either. AMD also is building CPUs to be used in massive data centers, the kind supporting the likes of Microsoft’s Azure cloud-based workstations and desktops and much more. And its GPUs are providing the speed, security, and scalability to keep these data centers performing at the level needed to push modern tech into the future.\n\nThe semiconductor and microprocessor industries are massive, representing hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue, but despite its spot in the Big Tech elite, Advanced Micro Devices is still particularly vulnerable to helium supply chain concerns.\n\nAs AMD’s biggest competitor, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is another company that develops graphics processing units, or GPUs. Nvidia are continually releasing new technologies to stay ahead of the competition and have an excellent reputation for quality. The company also manufactures processors that power many other devices such as automobiles, robots, and smartphones. These processors are often used for artificial intelligence systems like driverless cars or voice commands on mobile phones so we can expect Nvidia's technology to keep getting more advanced over time.\n\nNvidia's ambitious innovations are clear in all areas of tech, from computer graphics and artificial intelligence research that are core to robots or future cities. It’s also pushing new technologies into the world with its enterprise server GPUs—even setting records. Thanks for being there when we needed you most, Nvidia--and don't worry: your hardware will not go unsupported now that it has been so instrumental before this point too.\n\nWith more and more demand coming for semiconductors and new chip technology hitting the market, companies like Nvidia, AMD, Taiwan, Samsung and Intel are going to be some of the biggest benefactors. They’re already well-known in the industry, and this could just be their time to really shine. But a looming helium shortage could present a number of complications for the booming tech giants.\n\nIBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM), or International Business Machines Corporations, is a United States-based technology company. IBM specializes in developing and providing computer related products worldwide like the automated teller machine (ATM), magnetic stripe card and much, much more.\n\nIBM is often considered one of the leading companies in its tech realm, with a long list of inventions to date. And while this history certainly makes them an excellent candidate when it comes time to explore new trends such as blockchain technology.\n\nIBM’s blockchain platform, built on the open-source Hyperledger Fabric platform from the Linux Foundation is helping companies with a wide variety of blockchain solutions including tools for the finance sector, supply chain transparency, and letters of guarantee. IBM’s blockchain platform even helps interested parties develop their own blockchain solutions through educational tools and personalized assistance.\n\nIBM isn’t new to the semiconductor industry, either. In fact, it is pushing the boundaries of what semiconductors can achieve. And it wouldn’t be possible without helium. The vast majority of chips are made with silicon which needs to go through an extensive process to create specific circuitry. Helium has several roles in this process.\n\nThe Descartes Systems Group Inc. (TSX:DSG) is a Canadian multinational technology company specializing in logistics software, supply chain management software, and cloud-based services for logistics businesses. Recently, Descartes announced that it has successfully deployed its advanced capacity matching solution, Descartes MacroPoint Capacity Matching. The solution provides greater visibility and transparency within their network of carriers and brokers. This move could solidify the company as a key player in transportation logistics which is essential-and-often-overlooked in the mitigation of rising carbon emissions.\n\nMogo Finance Technology Inc. (TSX:GO) is a new spin on unsecured credit, which is a burgeoning sub-segment of FinTech. Providing loan management, the ability to track spending, stress-free mortgages, and even credit score tracking, Mogo is at the forefront of an online movement to assist users with their financial needs.\n\nMogo’s software analyzes borrowers instantly and greatly reduces the traditionally cumbersome underwriting process for loans. It’s online only, so there’s very low overhead and a ton of cash to spend on marketing. Labeled as “the Uber of finance” by CNBC, Mogo is definitely turning heads. With increasing membership growth and revenue lines continuing to improve, and a platform which many banks have failed to offer, Mogo could well become an acquisition target in the near future.\n\nOther Resource Companies To Keep An Eye On\n\nLithium Americas Corp. (TSX:LAC) is one of America’s most critical and promising pure-play lithium companies. With two world-class lithium projects in Argentina and Nevada, Lithium Americas is well-positioned to ride the wave of growing lithium demand in the years to come. It’s already raised nearly a billion dollars in equity and debt, showing that investors have a ton of interest in the company’s ambitious plans.\n\nLithium America is not looking over the growing pressure from investors for responsible and sustainable mining, either. In fact, one of its primary goals is to create a positive impact on society and the environment through its projects. This includes cleaner mining tech, strong workplace safety practices, a range of opportunities for employees, and strong relationships with local governments to ensure that not only are its employees being taken care of but local communities, as well.\n\nCelestica (TSX:CLS) is a key company in the resource boom due to is role as one of the top manufacturers of electronics in North America. Celestica’s wide range of products includes but is not limited to communications solutions, enterprise and cloud services, aerospace and defense products, renewable energy, and even healthcare tech.\n\nDue to its exposure to the renewable energy market, Celestica’s future is tied hand-in-hand with the green energy boom that’s sweeping the world at the moment. It helps build smart and efficient products that integrate the latest in power generation, conversion and management technology to deliver smarter, more efficient grid and off-grid applications for the world’s leading energy equipment manufacturers and producers.\n\nMaxar Technologies (TSX:MAXR) is one of the leading space companies on the planet, founded nearly 20 years ago. Maxar has a variety of services, including satellite development, space robotics, and earth observations.

(""Arena"" or the ""Company"") (TSX-V: AN) is pleased to announce it has completed drilling of its first diamond drill hole (DD-02) at the Sal de la Puna Project (“SDLP Project”) located in the Pastos Grandes basin within Salta province, Argentina. The diamond drill hole is located on the Almafuerte claim and intersected a continuous brine column from 140 metres to the total drilled depth of 646 metres. The entire sampled brine column averaged 496 milligrams per litre (“mg/l”) lithium (“Li”).\n\nAn uninterrupted gravel aquifer was intersected between 334 metres and 634 metres down hole, representing the thickest gravel sequence drilled in the basin. The gravel aquifer averaged 503 mg/l Li with grades as high as 557 mg/l Li at 550 metres below surface. Gravel and sand aquifers typically have favourable effective porosity values and high flow rates, which translate to highly productive wells. DD-02 was completed as an observation well with 2-inch diameter blank and screened PVC casing to 450 m depth.\n\nWilliam Randall, President & CEO of Arena, stated, “This first drill hole completed by Arena exceeds our expectations. The coarse gravel aquifer, where higher flow rates are typically found, appears to be thicker in our end of the Pastos Grandes basin with high grade lithium values and favourable geochemistry. We kept the drill turning past our target depth to determine the total thickness of this gravel sequence; however, the brine column remains open at depth for future potential resource expansion.” He added, “We have now mobilized an additional drill rig to ensure we meet our development timelines.”\n\nDepth specific brine sampling was caried out in DD-2 over the entire brine column using double and simple packer sampling systems. The brine column averaged magnesium to lithium ratios of 4.5 to 1 and sulphate to lithium ratios of 15 to 1.\n\nEduardo Morales, Executive Chairman of Arena, added, “In addition to excellent lithium grades, we are very pleased with the brine geochemistry. The magnesium and sulphate ratios are within those currently used in our pilot facilities giving us great confidence that our objective of producing technical grade lithium chloride (6% Li) is achievable from the drilled aquifers.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMobilization of two additional drills\n\nThe Company is also pleased to announce that two additional drill rigs have been mobilized to site. One diamond drill rig is currently set up at DD-01, located on the Graciela claim, and has a target depth of 550 metres. The depth of the hole may be extended if favourable lithologies are encountered, as happened in DD-02 in the adjacent Almafuerte claim.\n\nA second rotary drill is scheduled to mobilize in three weeks to Almafuerte to drill a production well (P-1) 15 metres away from DD-02. The well has a target depth of 450 metres and looks to test the productive capabilities of the gravel aquifer intersected in DD-02 by completing pumping tests using the neighbouring DD-02 as a monitoring well.\n\nArena is operating the drill program on behalf of Sal de la Puna Holdings Ltd., which is jointly owned by Arena (65%) and Ganfeng New Energy Technology Development (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. (“Ganfeng Lithium”; 1772.HK; OTCQX: GNENF) (35%).\n\nThe drill program is focused on the Almafuerte and Graciela blocks which border Lithium America’s (TSX: LAC; NYSE: LAC) Pastos Grandes project to the south and south-east and consists of 3,000 metres with the objective of both increasing the category of the current resource and increasing the SDLP Project’s resource base.\n\nThe drill program is jointly designed and supervised by the Company and Atacama Water consultants. All brine samples are sent to SGS Laboratories, Salta, Argentina, an independent and fully international accredited laboratory for analysis for lithium multi-element Induction Coupled Plasma Spectroscopy. Arena has a regimented Quality Assurance, Quality Control program where at least 10% duplicates, blanks and standards are inserted into each sample shipment.\n\nCorporate Matters\n\nThe Company has engaged Digitonic Limited to provide investor awareness services for USD216,000. Digitonic Limited is based in Glasgow, Scotland and operates under the direction of Mr. Neil Reynolds.\n\nAbout Arena Minerals Inc.\n\nArena owns 65% of the Sal de la Puna Project covering approximately 11,000 hectares of the Pastos Grandes basin located in Salta, Argentina. The claims are highly prospective and share the basin with two advanced lithium brine projects. In addition to Sal de la Puna, the Company owns the Antofalla lithium brine project in Argentina, consisting of four claims covering a total of 6,000 hectares of the central portion of Salar de Antofalla, located immediately south of Albemarle Corporation's Antofalla project. Arena has developed a proprietary brine processing technology using brine type reagents derived from the Antofalla project with the objective of producing more competitive battery grade lithium products.\n\nArena also owns 80 percent of the Atacama Copper property within the Antofagasta region of Chile, and 5.8 million shares of Astra Exploration. The projects are at low altitudes, within producing mining camps in infrastructure-rich areas, located in the heart of Chile's premier copper mining district.\n\nFor more information regarding the Company, its management, expertise, and projects, please visit www.arenaminerals.com.

"2022-04-01T22:15:49+00:00","The Top Reasons Lithium Americas Is a Screaming Buy","Lithium Americas (LAC) traded as high as $41.56 before slumping to about $24 Demand still outweighs supply For a greener future, we need as much lithium as possible smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last time I weighed in on Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC), I said, “The world is running short of lithium supply, while demand explodes.”\n\nThat was on November 15, as shares of LAC traded around $33 a share.\n\nShortly after, it would trade as high as $41.56 before slumping to about $24. Today, the LAC stock is back up to $37.05, and I’m still as bullish as I was in November. In fact, with several big catalyst ahead of it, I’d like to see Lithium Americas closer to $50 a share.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLAC Lithium Americas $38.22\n\nOne, Lithium Demand Still Outweighs Supply\n\nGovernments all over the world wants millions of electric vehicles on the roads. Plus, according to BloombergNEF, about two-thirds of autos will be electric by 2040. All as the world attempts to ditch internal combustion engines for emission free electric vehicles.\n\nThere’s just one tiny problem. There’s not enough supply to meet that kind of demand. That’s because no one really saw this kind of demand coming.\n\n“There is the quadrupling of demand in just five years and probably a growth of six or seven times over 10 years. So, clearly the industry is not prepared today for that level of demand – the amount of incremental capacity that the industry needs over the next 10 years is at least 1.5 million mt and in terms of capital investment, will probably require $45 billion-$50 billion of investment into new projects or expansions of existing operations,” said iLi Markets partner Daniel Jimenez, as quoted by S&P Global Platts.\n\nTwo, the U.S. Government May Offer Support\n\nThe U.S. government could soon throw its weight — and mone — behind lithium.\n\nThere’s speculation President Joe Biden could invoke a Cold War-era defense law, all in an effort to boost domestic production of metals needed to make EV batteries. According to a Bloomberg report, that defense law could allow the government to use a $750 million Title III fund to help increase domestic production of essential metals and minerals, such as lithium. That could be extremely beneficial for companies, like Lithium Americas.\n\nStory continues\n\nThree, Lithium Americas May Be Close to Production\n\nAt the moment, Lithium Americas Thacker Pass project may be the closest to development, with plans to begin construction later this year. Should that happen, the LAC stock could double, if not triple on the idea it can help the U.S. meet more of its lithium needs.\n\nAt Thacker Pass, “Results of a Feasibility Study on the first phase of Thacker Pass (for at least 30,000-35,000 tpa of lithium carbonate) are expected by year end. Engineering is underway to consider a 20,000 tpa lithium hydroxide chemical conversion plant, to provide flexibility to meet potential customer and partner needs,” according to a recent company press release.\n\nI’m also waiting on progress at its Caucharí-Olaroz mine, which could see production later this year, and produce up to 40,000 tonnes per year.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWith global governments pushing for a greener future, we need as much lithium as possible. Unfortunately, there’s just not enough supply to satisfy that demand at the moment. However, with a potential Cold War-era defense law, and news LAC is close to development, Lithium Americas could see significant upside potential, near-term.\n\nAs I noted above, “Governments all over the world wants millions of electric vehicles on the roads. Plus, according to Bloomberg NEF, half of all auto sales by 2035 will be electric. All as the world attempts to ditch internal combustion engines for emission free electric vehicles.”\n\nRight now, that can’t happen. Hopefully, Lithium Americas can help.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

"2022-03-31T18:44:21+00:00","U.S. lithium miners' shares charge up on likely Biden EV order","By Ruhi Soni\n\n(Reuters) - Shares of U.S. lithium miners climbed for a second straight session on Thursday, after a report that President Joe Biden could invoke a law to encourage domestic production of minerals needed to make electric-vehicle batteries.\n\nAlbemarle Corp, Livent Corp and Lithium Americas climbed between 3% and 7%, as the order is expected to help miners access government funding for feasibility studies on new projects that extract lithium, nickel and other EV metals, or to make existing facilities more productive.\n\n""By invoking the Defense Production Act, the Biden administration would presumably be signaling somewhat of a carte blanche endorsement for the domestic EV and battery materials sector,"" said Christopher Kapsch, senior equity research analyst at Loop Capital.\n\nThe order could be invoked as soon as this week, but it was not immediately clear how much funding could be allocated, according to the report.\n\nKapsch believes the order would likely be a bigger benefit for early-stage lithium miners that have U.S. operations - including Piedmont Lithium Inc, ioneer, Lithium Americas Corp and Standard Lithium - as Biden's order could speed up their production timelines or cut capital costs.\n\nCanada's Standard Lithium gained 11% while Australia's ioneer Ltd closed 20% higher earlier in the day.\n\n""The order could lower the costs to build new capacity. It's unclear if the funds could be used for upstream mining, but at the very least, it would likely be used for building downstream conversion capacity,"" said Seth Goldstein, equity strategist at Morningstar.\n\n(Reporting by Ruhi Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath and Sriraj Kalluvila)","https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/u-lithium-miners-shares-charge-184421582.html","LAC.TO","LAC.US","WUC1.F","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ALBEMARLE CORP","CHRISTOPHER KAPSCH","DOMESTIC PRODUCTION","JOE BIDEN","LITHIUM","LITHIUM AMERICAS","LIVENT CORP","MINERS","","","","","0.691","0.036","0.9","0.064"
