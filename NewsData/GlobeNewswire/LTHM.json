If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member.\n\nAccording to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Livent\u2019s supply contract with Nemaska Lithium Inc. was terminated. As a result, the Company was forced to fulfill customer contracts using different vendors with unfavorable terms, reducing revenues and lowering margins. Livent had a long-standing contract to supply lithium hydroxide to a customer at a significantly lower price than its existing contacts. When the customer increased its orders, the Company\u2019s margins were further squeezed. Based on these facts, the Company\u2019s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the IPO period. When the market learned the truth about Livent, investors suffered damages.\n\nJoin the case to recover your losses.\n\nThe Schall Law Firm represents investors around the world and specializes in securities class action lawsuits and shareholder rights litigation.\n\nThis press release may be considered Attorney Advertising in some jurisdictions under the applicable law and rules of ethics.\n\nCONTACT:\n\nThe Schall Law Firm\r\n Brian Schall, Esq.,\r\nwww.schallfirm.com\r\nOffice: 310-301-3335\r\nCell: 424-303-1964\r\ninfo@schallfirm.com\n\nSOURCE:\n\nThe Schall Law Firm","link":"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/news-release\/2019\/07\/22\/1885761\/0\/en\/MONDAY-DEADLINE-ALERT-The-Schall-Law-Firm-Announces-the-Filing-of-a-Class-Action-Lawsuit-Against-Livent-Corporation-and-Encourages-Investors-with-Losses-in-Excess-of-100-000-to-Con.html","symbols":["LTHM.US"],"tags":["CLASS ACTION","LIVENT","LTHM","SCHALL LAW","SCHALL LAW FIRM"],"sentiment":{"polarity":-0.926,"neg":0.113,"neu":0.816,"pos":0.071}},{"date":"2019-07-19T19:00:00+00:00","title":"FINAL DEADLINE ALERT - Livent Corporation (LTHM) - Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Announces Class Action and Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 22, 2019","content":"NEW YORK, July  19, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Attorney Advertising -- Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Livent Corporation (\u201cLivent\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE: LTHM) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired Livent securities pursuant and\/or traceable to the company\u2019s initial public offering completed in October 2018 (the \u201cIPO\u201d or the \u201cOffering\u201d).

Livent\u2019s supply contract with Nemaska Lithium Inc. was terminated. As a result, the Company was forced to fulfill customer contracts using different vendors with unfavorable terms, reducing revenues and lowering margins. Livent had a long-standing contract to supply lithium hydroxide to a customer at a significantly lower price than its existing contacts. When the customer increased its orders, the Company\u2019s margins were further squeezed.

Livent\u2019s supply contract with Nemaska Lithium Inc. was terminated. As a result, the Company was forced to fulfill customer contracts using different vendors with unfavorable terms, reducing revenues and lowering margins. Livent had a long-standing contract to supply lithium hydroxide to a customer at a significantly lower price than its existing contacts. When the customer increased its orders, the Company\u2019s margins were further squeezed. Based on these facts, the Company\u2019s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the IPO period.

In particular, the Registration Statement failed to disclose that the Company was experiencing material construction delays. These construction delays would cause system deployments (or \u201cacceptances\u201d as Defendants referred to them) to fall significantly below even the low end of the Company\u2019s previously announced guidance. While the Registration Statement purported to warn of risks that \u201cmay arise,\u201d which could materially affect the Company, in actuality these material negative events were already occurring. As a result, the representations and purported risk disclosures were false and misleading because, by the time of the IPO, construction delays had already impacted or would soon impact Bloom Energy\u2019s ability to deliver acceptances in line with its guidance.\n\nGet additional information about the BE lawsuit: http:\/\/www.kleinstocklaw.com\/pslra-1\/bloom-energy-corporation-loss-submission-form?wire=3\n\nIndivior PLC (OTCMKTS: INVVY)\r\n Class Period: March 10, 2015 to April 9, 2019\r\n Lead Plaintiff Deadline: June 24, 2019\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Indivior PLC made materially false and\/or misleading statements and\/or failed to disclose during the class period that: (1) Indivior and its executives engaged in an illicit nationwide scheme to increase prescriptions of Suboxone Film; (2) Indivior illegally obtained billions of dollars in revenue from Suboxone Film prescriptions by deceiving health care providers and health care benefit programs; (3) as a result of the aforementioned misconduct, Indivior would face felony charges; and (4) due to the foregoing, Defendants\u2019 statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and\/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.\n\nGet additional information about the INVVY lawsuit: http:\/\/www.kleinstocklaw.com\/pslra-1\/indivior-plc-loss-submission-form?wire=3\n\nDynagas LNG Partners LP (NYSE: DLNG)\r\n Class Period: February 16, 2018 to March 21, 2019\r\n Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 16, 2019\n\nThe complaint alleges that throughout the class period Dynagas LNG Partners LP made materially false and\/or misleading statements and\/or failed to disclose that: the terms of the Company\u2019s long-term contracts on its liquid natural gas ships, Arctic Aurora and Ob River, were unfavorable and resulted in the Company's inability to sustain its quarterly distributions.

If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member.\n\nAccording to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Livent\u2019s supply contract with Nemaska Lithium Inc. was terminated. As a result, the Company was forced to fulfill customer contracts using different vendors with unfavorable terms, reducing revenues and lowering margins. Livent had a long-standing contract to supply lithium hydroxide to a customer at a significantly lower price than its existing contacts. When the customer increased its orders, the Company\u2019s margins were further squeezed. Based on these facts, the Company\u2019s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the IPO period.
