Is there anywhere?\n\nEnergy used to be the go-to \u201csafe\u201d sector but those stocks have sold off big over the last 6 weeks. Even stocks known to be \u201cdefensive\u201d like Walmart might not be in 2022.\n\nScreening for Growth Stocks with High Dividends\n\nTracey ran a screen that looked for increasing earnings growth, a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) and a dividend yielding over 5%.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough combination but it yielded 36 stocks.\n\nStripping out the #3 (Hold) stocks, left just 7 stocks with the highest Zacks Ranks. Just 2 stocks were Zacks Rank #1s, with growth and with a dividend over 5%.\n\nThat\u2019s an exclusive club.\n\nHiding Out in Dividend Stocks\n\n1. Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile SQM\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera is a Chilean chemical company whose products include fertilizers, iodine, and lithium. Sociedad Quimica y Minera is the largest lithium producer in the world after tripling production over the last 3 years.\n\nShares have soared in 2022, up 87%, but are still cheap with a forward P\/E of just 8.9 as earnings are on the rise. It\u2019s a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera is paying a big dividend. Zacks says it\u2019s yielding 9.7% but it varies each quarter.\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera reports earnings on Aug 17. Is it time to get in?\n\n2. Petrobras PBR\n\nPetrobras is a large Brazilian oil company. It\u2019s also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as earnings are expected to be up this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nPetrobras shares are up just 13.6% year-to-date on fears about government pressures to keep gasoline prices down. But that makes them dirt cheap, with a forward P\/E of just 2.5.\n\nIt is paying an incredible dividend thanks to rising energy prices with Zacks saying the yield is 24.9%. Yes, 24.9%.\n\nBut like SQM above, it may vary each quarter.\n\nIs Petrobras a risk you should take?\n\n3. EPR Properties EPR\n\nEPR Properties is a REIT which owns 355 properties in 44 states and Canada specializing in experiences and connections. That means golf entertainment complexes, casinos, e-gaming, concert venues and climbing gyms.\n\nShares are up 10% year-to-date and are cheap with a forward P\/E of just 11.\n\nEPR Properties is expected to see earnings growth of 46% in 2022 as the economy reopens from the COVID restrictions and people want to travel and be out of their homes. It\u2019s a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nEPR pays a monthly dividend which is expected to be $3.30 per share annualized which is a yield of 6.4%.\n\nShould you consider a REIT like EPR Properties for the income?\n\nWhat Else Should You Know About Hiding Out in Dividend Stocks?\n\nTune into this week\u2019s podcast to find out.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.15%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.71%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.08%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the chemicals company had gained 3.06% over the past month, outpacing the Basic Materials sector's loss of 7.87% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.44% in that time.\n\nWall Street will be looking for positivity from SQM as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $3.11, up 903.23% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.03 billion, up 245.35% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nSQM's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $10.71 per share and revenue of $8.51 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +422.44% and +197.34%, respectively.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for SQM. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 12.92% higher. SQM currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nDigging into valuation, SQM currently has a Forward P\/E ratio of 8.91. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P\/E of 4.8.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, we should mention that SQM has a PEG ratio of 0.5. This metric is used similarly to the famous P\/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. SQM's industry had an average PEG ratio of 0.57 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Fertilizers industry is part of the Basic Materials sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 47, which puts it in the top 19% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The increase was mainly driven by higher direct operating costs resulting from higher labor costs and increased commodity inputs, including higher fuel and energy costs.\n\nAll-in sustaining costs (AISC) for gold were up 15.8% year over year to $1,199 per ounce, mainly due to higher CAS per gold equivalent ounce.\n\nRegional Performance\n\nNorth America: Second-quarter attributable gold production in North America was 316,000 ounces, down 20% year over year. Gold CAS in the region was $1,124 per ounce, up 46% year over year.\n\nSouth America: Attributable gold production in South America was 210,000 ounces, up 11% year over year.

At the end of the quarter, the company had long-term debt of $5,568 million, up 11.6% year over year.\n\nNet cash from continuing operations amounted to $1,033 million. Free cash flow totaled $514 million in the second quarter.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor 2022, Newmont expects attributable gold production of 6 million ounces. The company also expects gold CAS to be $900 per ounce and AISC to be $1,150 per ounce.\n\nNewmont\u2019s cost guidance reflects the impact of lower production volumes and higher direct operating costs related to labor, energy, consumables and supplies due to sustained inflationary pressures.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nNewmont\u2019s shares have declined 14.9% in the past year compared with a 29.5% fall of the industry.

Therefore, those who anticipate the broader electrification of mobility may want to focus their attention on undervalued lithium stocks to buy now.\n\nFirst, the companies that mine and produce lithium enjoy a remarkably strong demand profile. As Time recently stated, prices for the underlying commodity are up 400%. Further, experts note that supply will get worse before it gets better, creating significant implications for the EV market. Since EVs can\u2019t go anywhere without lithium, this dynamic fosters a cynically compelling backdrop for undervalued lithium stocks to buy now.\n\nSecond, while acquiring individual EV manufacturers may yield the greatest profitability potential, this strategy comes with one major caveat: you\u2019ve got to guess correctly. With the number of sector participants constantly rising, it\u2019s difficult to predict who will ultimately come out on top.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n7 Cheap Stocks That Are Trading at a Discount\n\nBut with undervalued lithium stocks to buy, you\u2019re dealing with broader needs rather than specific consumer tastes. Therefore, this indirect approach to EVs could drive more confidence to investors.\n\nTicker Company Current Price LTHM Livent Corporation $22.64 SQM Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile S.A. $88.76 PILBF Pilbara Minerals Limited $1.73\n\nUndervalued Lithium Stocks: Livent (LTHM) Livent Corporation logo on a phone screen. LTHM stock.\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold \/ Shutterstock\n\nBilled as a lithium technology partner, Livent (NYSE:LTHM) leverages its material science expertise to provide solutions across various industries and applications. Primarily, the company is focused on energy storage and battery systems, providing ultra-pure lithium hydroxide monohydrate. In addition, the company delivers polymer products that empower industrial applications.\n\nWhile Livent suffered an off-year because of the coronavirus pandemic, it\u2019s rapidly making up for lost time. In 2021, the company generated $420.4 million in revenue, which was up over 8% from 2019\u2019s result. Further, in the first quarter of 2022, Livent posted sales of $143.5 million, representing a gain of over 56% against the year-ago level.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompared to other companies in the space, Livent is putting up solid metrics against key benchmarks. For instance, its net margin of 11.6% is notably above the chemicals industry median of 7%. While shares are down about 7% year-to-date, LTHM makes an interesting case for undervalued lithium stocks to buy as demand for targeted solutions pick up.\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM) Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's web page on it\n\nSource: madamF \/ Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the powerhouses in the lithium arena, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) has geography as a key advantage. A Chilean chemicals firm, its home market represents the second-largest producer of lithium. Further, U.S. relations with Chile is a net positive.\n\nIn fact, the State Department notes on its website that \u201cChile is one of the United States\u2019 strongest partners in Latin America and a leader in promoting respect for the rule of law, economic stability, education, environmental protection, human rights, and sustainable development.\u201d With the world seemingly going mad, it\u2019s nice to have international partners you can depend on.\n\nBetter yet, SQM knows how to deliver the goods. Again, 2020 was a rough time for the company. However, it bounced back in 2021 with sales of $2.86 billion, up 47% from 2019\u2019s result. Also, SQM is off to a flying start in 2022, with Q1 sales of $2 billion up nearly quadruple that of the year-ago quarter\u2019s tally.\n\nSQM encountered some softening over the past month, which makes it intriguing as one of the undervalued lithium stocks to buy on account of its financial robustness.\n\nUndervalued Lithium Stocks:\u00a0Pilbara Minerals (PILBF) A photo of a kangaroo on the beach at Cape Le Grand National Park in Australia.\n\nSource: John Crux \/ Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Australia, Pilbara Minerals (OTCMKTS:PILBF) is a pure-play lithium company. According to the company\u2019s website, Pilbara owns 100% of the world\u2019s largest, independent hard-rock lithium operation. As with SQM above, Pilbara enjoys a geographic advantage.\n\nFirst, Australia is one of the closest allies of the U.S. and western nations, an important partner in the eastern hemisphere. Second, Australia is a natural resource powerhouse, being the world\u2019s largest producer of opal and the largest exporter of coal. Of course, it\u2019s an important source of several other commodities, including lithium.\n\nNow, it\u2019s important to point out that PILBF is really what most folks would call a penny stock. As well, shares have dropped 32% in 2022. Nevertheless, against a basket of valuation metrics, PILBF is considered significantly undervalued.\n\nAlthough nominal revenues have been muted, the company has really picked up steam in 2021. For the half-year period ended Dec. 31, 2021, Pilbara generated $208.7 million in revenue, up 369% against the year-ago comparison. Therefore, if you want to take a speculative shot with undervalued lithium stocks to buy, PILBF could be interesting.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P\/E of 4.59.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is also worth noting that SQM currently has a PEG ratio of 0.47. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P\/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

A quick glance at the company's year-to-date performance in comparison to the rest of the Basic Materials sector should help us answer this question.\n\nNutrien is a member of the Basic Materials sector. This group includes 242 individual stocks and currently holds a Zacks Sector Rank of #12. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups. The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.\n\nThe Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months.

(NYSE:SQM). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile\n\nIs Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile still cheap?\n\nThe share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock\u2019s cash flows. I find that Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile\u2019s ratio of 17.68x is trading slightly above its industry peers\u2019 ratio of 15.58x, which means if you buy Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile should be trading at this level in the long run, then there should only be a fairly immaterial downside vs other industry peers. Furthermore, it seems like Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile\u2019s share price is quite stable, which means there may be less chances to buy low in the future now that it\u2019s priced similarly to industry peers. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.\n\nWhat does the future of Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat this means for you:\n\nAre you a shareholder? SQM\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at SQM? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on SQM, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for SQM, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. When we did our research, we found 3 warning signs for Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that we believe deserve your full attention.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

In that same time, the Basic Materials sector lost 22.01%, while the S&P 500 lost 1%.\n\nInvestors will be hoping for strength from SQM as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, SQM is projected to report earnings of $3.11 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 903.23%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $1.73 billion, up 194.81% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nSQM's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $10.71 per share and revenue of $8.51 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +422.44% and +197.34%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for SQM. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell).

Check Out These 2 Basic Materials Names","content":"Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Celanese (CE) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $4.51 a share 22 days away from its upcoming earnings release on July 28, 2022.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $4.51 Most Accurate Estimate and the $4.48 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Celanese has an Earnings ESP of 0.69%.\n\nCE is just one of a large group of Basic Materials stocks with a positive ESP figure. SQM (SQM) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nSQM, which is readying to report earnings on August 18, 2022, sits at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $4.08 a share, and SQM is 43 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for SQM is $2.75, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 48.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nCE and SQM's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The massive equity selloff eroded more than $9 trillion in market value in the same time frame, per Bloomberg data. The pullback was triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war, disrupted supply chain systems, sky-high inflation and rising interest rates. Stubborn inflation readings prompted the central bank to get all the more hawkish. Last month, Fed hiked interest rates by 75 bps, the highest increase since 1994.\u00a0Similar hikes in the remainder of the year are not ruled out.\n\nFed Chairman Powell vowed last week that he would not let the economy slip into a higher interest rate regime even if that calls for hiking interest rates to a level that would put economic growth at risk. Recessionary fears are currently dominating the market mood and until inflation is tamed meaningfully, the problems are likely to persist.\n\nIn such turbulent times, value investing is the key.\u00a0In value analysis, though price-to-earnings (P\/E) and price-to-sales (P\/S) are most preferred by investors, the underrated earnings yield ratio is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with exceptional returns. Cabot Corporation CBT, Range Resources Corporation RRC, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. SQM, HSBC Holdings plc HSBC and Imperial Oil Ltd. IMO are some high earnings yield value stocks.\n\nUnlock Portfolio Value Through Earnings Yield\n\nAs the global economy is struggling with skyrocketing inflation and low growth, the World Bank has warned of a recession.\u00a0During times of market weakness,\u00a0investors might be tempted to resort to panic selling. Contrarily, they should focus on value investing and ferret out fundamentally strong companies that are trading at a discount now. The value investing approach seeks to profit from investing in stocks that appear to be trading at a discount to their intrinsic values. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies.\n\nOne interesting ratio that you can consider for picking attractively valued stocks is earnings yield.\u00a0The ratio is the inverse of the price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio and is measured as (Annual Earnings per Share\/Market Price) x 100. While comparing similar stocks, the one with higher earnings yield is more likely to provide better returns, with other factors remaining constant.\n\nEarnings Yield, in fact, has the edge over the popular P\/E ratio as the former facilitates the comparison of the performance of a market index with the 10-year Treasury yield. When the yield of the market index is more than the 10-year Treasury yield, stocks can be considered undervalued in comparison to bonds and vice versa. In such a situation, for value investors, investing in the stock market may be a better option than the bond market.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that T-bills are risk-free, while stock investments come with a caveat. It would be a good idea to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while comparing it with the earnings yield of a stock or the overall market.\n\nThe Winning Strategy\n\nWe have set\u00a0Earnings Yield greater than 10% as our primary screening criterion but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential of generating solid returns. So, we have added the following parameters to the screen:\n\nEstimated EPS growth for the next 12 months greater than or equal to the S&P 500: This metric compares the 12-month forward EPS estimate with the 12-month actual EPS.\n\nAverage Daily Volume (20 Day) greater than or equal to 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stock has adequate liquidity.\n\nCurrent Price greater than or equal to $5.\n\nBuy-Rated Stocks: Stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have been known to outperform peers in any type of market environment. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nOur Picks\n\nHere are the five of the 136 stocks that made it through the screen:\n\nCabot: Based in Boston, Cabot is a leading global specialty chemicals and performance materials company. The firm is committed to boosting its specialty compounds business globally. It is riding on several acquisitions, including NSCC Carbon black plant, Shenzhen Sanshun, and Tokai Carbon black plant\u00a0among others. Healthy cash flows, balance sheet strength and shareholder-friendly moves are positives in Cabot\u2019s story.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cabot\u2019s fiscal 2022 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 23% and 22.5%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS has moved north by 5 cents over the past 30 days.\u00a0Over the trailing four quarters, Cabot surpassed earnings estimates on all occasions, with the average surprise being 16.17%. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nRange Resources: Based in Texas, Range Resources is an oil and gas explorer with extensive resources in key regions like Marcellus Shale & North Louisiana. The company is set to reap benefits in the long term from its projects in the Appalachian Basin. As most of its production comprises natural gas, RRC is well-positioned to capitalize on the mounting clean energy demand.The upstream energy firm expects free cash flow to exceed $1.4 billion this year, which could be the highest among the Appalachian players.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for RRC\u2019s 2022 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 25% and 142%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS has moved north by 29 cents over the past 30 days.\u00a0The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Value Score of A.\n\nSociedad Quimica: Chile-based Sociedad Quimica produces plant nutrients, iodine, lithium and industrial chemicals. It benefits from being a low-cost producer of potassium chloride, potassium sulfate and potassium nitrate. Higher demand also supports sales volumes in Sociedad Quimica\u2019s specialty plant nutrition business. Rising demand is also backing the higher prices of potassium chloride. SQM is seeing a significant rise in global potassium prices, driven by the shortage of potash and potassium-based fertilizers.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for SQM\u2019s 2022 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 165.5% and 363%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS has moved north by $1.52 over the past 30 days.\u00a0The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 17.7%,\n\nHSBC: London-based HSBC is a major global banking and financial services firm, with $3.02 trillion in assets as of Mar 31, 2022.\u00a0A strong capital position, initiatives to strengthen digital capabilities, an extensive network and improvement in operating efficiency through business restructuring will likely keep aiding HSBC\u2019s growth.Exit from the U.S. and French retail banking operations is expected to help the company focus on Asia. In sync with this, the acquisition of AXA Singapore insurance assets will expand the company's business in the region.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HSBC\u2019s 2022 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 4.3% and 2%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS has moved north by 3 cents over the past 60 days.\u00a0The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 21.2%,\n\nImperial Oil: Calgary-based Imperial Oil is one of the largest integrated oil companies in Canada. Strong execution and ramped-up activities in Kearl, Cold Lake and Syncrude projects position the company for solid production growth and are expected to augment its revenues and earnings going forward. Imperial Oil's strong balance sheet, ability to generate cash flow and a shareholder-friendly policy should also favor the stock.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Imperial Oil\u2019s 2022 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 82.2% and 177.3%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS has moved north by 73 cents over the past 30 days.\u00a0 The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A.\n\nYou can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for a 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard stock picking and backtesting software.

This change lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.88%.

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $1.71 billion, up 190.8% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $9.49 per share and revenue of $7.6 billion, which would represent changes of +362.93% and +165.55%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for SQM should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P\/E of 4.81.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, we should mention that SQM has a PEG ratio of 0.5.

(NYSE:SQM) shareholders have seen the share price descend 18% over the month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been very strong. In fact, the share price is up a full 203% compared to three years ago. After a run like that some may not be surprised to see prices moderate. The thing to consider is whether the underlying business is doing well enough to support the current price.\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nSociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile was able to grow its EPS at 44% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 45% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that sentiment and expectations have not changed drastically. Au contraire, the share price change has arguably mimicked the EPS growth.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nIt is of course excellent to see how Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our freereport on how its financial position has changed over time.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile, it has a TSR of 230% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe're pleased to report that Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 105% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 26% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile better, we need to consider many other factors.

However, Piedmont\u2019s regulatory troubles have gotten it in hot water, which cast a shadow of uncertainty on its future.\n\nThe company doesn\u2019t have permits for its project from either the state or the local government. Moreover, it faces strong opposition from the Gaston County Board, which is responsible for granting permission to develop the mine. Despite everything hanging in the balance, PLL stock trades at a lofty valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nCBAK Energy Technology (CBAT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for CBAK Energy Technology (CBAT)\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh \/ Shutterstock.com\n\nCBAK Energy Technology (NASDAQ:CBAT) is an EV lithium-ion battery producer in Mainland China.

Hence, losing one customer will result in a huge blow to its fundamentals. Additionally, our stock has fallen out of favor with its investors, having shed over 70% of its value in the past 12 months.\n\nRecently, CBAK announced its acquisition of a troubled battery materials supplier in Hitrans Lithium Battery Technology. CBAK claims that Hirans generated roughly four times its revenues during the first nine months of last year.\n\n7 Unstoppable Stocks to Own in 2022\n\nHowever, filings have shown that the acquired company\u2019s financials are extremely weak, with large cash deficits. Hence, with plenty of uncertainties surrounding its business, CBAK stock remains a highly risky bet in its sector.\n\nLithium Stocks: Standard Lithium (SLI) a pile of lithium.

It\u2019s a penny stock that gained incredibly in 2020 from multiple catalysts.\n\nHowever, the movement in stock price wasn\u2019t related to the company fundamentals. The company is a pre-revenue business that needs constant cash flow injections to stay afloat. Naturally, it could pay off in the long run if it hits big in the coming years. However, the chances of its success seem minimal at this time.\n\nLithium demand is expected to rise at a staggering pace over the next several years.

Its fundamentals are impressive from top to bottom, and have kicked into overdrive of late.\n\nWith the rising metal prices, Elon Musk recently tweeted about Tesla getting into the lithium mining and refining business. Musk said that though there is no shortage of lithium, the pace of refinement is slow. Moreover, the \u201cPrice of lithium has gone to insane levels.\u201d It remains to be seen how successful the business might turn out to be in terms of improving supply and limiting costs.\n\nNevertheless, TSLA stock\u2019s meteoric price remains a bone of contention, with it trading over 50 times enterprise value to EBITDA.\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov\/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) is a leading lithium conglomerate business that has been one of the most consistent performers in its niche. Its operations are highly diversified from a geographic standpoint, which gives it the edge over its competition.\n\nMoreover, the variety of locations it operates in gives it a unique advantage in dealing with different governments.\u00a0 The stability of its business is linked to the stability of its mines, which has plenty to do ALB\u2019s relationship with various governments.\u00a0 Nevertheless, it has established itself as a juggernaut in the sector, and it\u2019s in the best position to capitalize on the demand for lithium.\n\n7 Great Dividend Stocks Under $25\n\nThere are, however, plenty of risks to consider with ALB stock. Firstly, it trades at a nosebleed valuation of 4.70 times forward sales estimates. Moreover, it is always at the mercy of governments and institutions, which could significantly hamper its business.\n\nLithium Stocks: Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM) Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's web page on it.

Moreover, it\u2019s been a top performer in the sector, growing sales and EBITDA by over 100% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThough there\u2019s plenty to like about SQM, Chilean lithium faces immense political risks. Social Convergence, a left-leaning party, recently won the elections in Chile, and the parliament subsequently voted to repeal the current constitution.\n\nSQM enjoyed a privileged position under the old constitution. The consensus is that the new Chilean government will be looking to nationalize the production of copper and lithium.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile\n\nWhat Is Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile's Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of March 2022 Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile had US$2.62b of debt, an increase on US$1.94b, over one year. However, it does have US$3.29b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$670.5m. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Healthy Is Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile's Balance Sheet?\n\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile had liabilities of US$2.49b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$2.77b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$3.29b as well as receivables valued at US$1.19b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$780.4m.\n\nGiven Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile has a humongous market capitalization of US$27.4b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nStory continues\n\nEven more impressive was the fact that Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile grew its EBIT by 391% over twelve months. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Looking at the most recent three years, Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile recorded free cash flow of 43% of its EBIT, which is weaker than we'd expect. That weak cash conversion makes it more difficult to handle indebtedness.\n\nSumming up\n\nWe could understand if investors are concerned about Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$670.5m. And it impressed us with its EBIT growth of 391% over the last year. So is Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.  We've identified 4 warning signs  with Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile (at least 1 which is concerning)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

There is, however, a silver lining. A market downturn is a great opportunity to load up on high-quality names. For example, large-cap stocks with strong fundamentals.\n\nWhen stocks overall move lower, that\u2019s the case for both more speculative plays, as well as sturdier opportunities. The latter may not experience as sharp of a plunge as the former. In fact, some of them, like commodities stocks, can perform well, as rising commodities prices outweigh external factors. Still, if you have a long time horizon in mind, you can enter\/add to a position at an ideal price point.\n\n7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for June 2022\n\nSo, what are some examples of such plays? Consider these seven top-rated, large-cap stocks. Each one has the potential to deliver solid returns (via appreciation and dividends) for buy and hold investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTicker Company Current Price CF CF Industries Holdings $91.19 DLTR Dollar Tree $162.51 HSY Hershey Company $211.74 KR Kroger Co. $51.61 OXY Occidental Petroleum $69.87 PAYX Paychex $125.68 SQM Sociedad Quimica Y Minera De Chile S.A. $100.22\n\nCF Industries Holdings (CF)\n\nCF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) is a good example of what I was talking about above. Thanks to a boom in commodities prices (in its case, fertilizer), shares are up sharply in what has so far been a down year for stocks.\n\nAs the Russia\/Ukraine conflict has slashed supply of key fertilizer ingredients like ammonia, nitrogen and urea, it\u2019s no surprise CF stock surged earlier this year. More recently, it has been trading sideways, as investors factor in a pullback in spot fertilizer prices. Yet that doesn\u2019t mean CF Industries\u2019 key tailwind is about to bust out.\n\nEven if prices fall from their highs, they\u2019re expected to remain elevated compared to prior year levels. This bodes well for the stock, as it today trades at a heavily discounted valuation (5x estimated 2022 earnings). An established name in this space, it stands to continue to perform well, during today\u2019s boom, and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis stock earns an \u201cA\u201d rating in my Portfolio Grader.\n\nDollar Tree (DLTR)\n\nLike other stocks in the space, shares in discount retailer Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) plunged in mid-May, following underwhelming earnings reports from two of its peers.\n\nHowever, within a week, DLTR stock completely bounced back. The reason? Its strong quarterly earnings report. Reporting strong revenue and earnings growth, demonstrating the market\u2019s fears of inflationary pressures affecting its performance were an overreaction. What does this short-term boost have to do with its bona fides as a long-term buy-and-hold play?\n\nLike some other high-quality discount retailers, it\u2019s thriving despite the challenges presented by today\u2019s high rates of inflation. As this factor has little-to-no impact on its growth, Dollar Tree is well positioned to continue steadily increasing its revenue and earnings. This will enable the stock to continue delivering solid returns. With this, consider it one of the best large-cap stocks out there to make a long-term position.\n\n7 Solar Stocks to Buy and Hold for a Bright Future\n\nThis stock earns an \u201cA\u201d rating in my Portfolio Grader.\n\nHershey Company (HSY)\n\nHershey Company (NYSE:HSY) is a defensive play, with a deep economic moat. It also pays out a steady dividend (forward yield of 1.72%), a payout that has gone up twelve years in a row. All these factors make it the kind of stock you want to own in a down market.\n\nThese safe harbor bona fides also explain why HSY stock is up for the year. In the move to \u201crisk off,\u201d investors have pivoted to venerable names like this one. It also helps that the confectionary giant has also done a great job of adjusting to the impact of rising raw material, labor and transport costs.\n\nWith demand staying robust, despite it passing along costs to the consumer, Hershey raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast in April. More resistant to today\u2019s economic challenges than many other stocks (including some other packaged goods stocks), consider it a buy.\n\nThis stock earns an \u201cA\u201d rating in my Portfolio Grader.\n\nKroger (KR)\n\nGrocery chain operator Kroger (NYSE:KR) is yet another high-quality, large-cap stock that has performed well in 2022. Even after a pullback last month, it\u2019s up around 14.5% year-to-date.\n\nSpeaking of its pullback, the May selloff in KR stock should be seen as a buying opportunity. Why? Its drop was entirely due to the downward pressure put on retailer stocks following the bad quarterly numbers for two large retailers that I referenced above when talking about Dollar Tree.\n\nAlthough Kroger hasn\u2019t yet reported earnings, the sell-side has raised its earnings forecast in recent months. This suggests the company will show, like it did last quarter, that high inflation is not affecting its performance, like it is for other retailers. Only partially bouncing back in recent weeks, you may want to take advantage of this weakness, by starting to accumulate a long-term position in the stock.\n\n7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Now if You Have $250 to Spend\n\nThis stock earns an \u201cA\u201d rating in my Portfolio Grader.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY)\n\nThe sharp rise in oil prices, plus Warren Buffett\u2019s big purchase of shares, have resulted in an epic run for Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) so far this year. It\u2019s up 125% year-to-date.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t take this to mean you\u2019ve \u201cmissed out\u201d on this opportunity. This remains one of the best large-cap stocks out there to make a long-term holding. Why? There are many factors, not just Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, that are behind the spiking of crude oil prices. Prices could stay elevated for longer than expected.\n\nLong-term, there\u2019s something else (not talked about that much) that could mean continued growth for OXY stock. That would be its move into \u201cnet-zero\u201d oil. Moving into this area could pay off down the road, if stricter environmental regulations require its use. Benefiting from high oil prices, and with a \u201cgreen\u201d catalyst hiding in plain sight, it\u2019s a buy.\n\nThis stock earns an \u201cA\u201d rating in my Portfolio Grader.\n\nPaychex (PAYX)\n\nIn contrast to many of the large-cap stocks listed above, Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) shares are in the red for 2022, down over 6%. Recession fears are likely putting pressure on this payroll, benefits and HR outsourcing company. After all, recessions mean lower employment, hence lower demand for its services.\n\nBut it\u2019s possible investors are too pessimistic. Providing back office services is essential for the operation of a small or medium-sized enterprise. An economic downturn shouldn\u2019t have an outsized impact on its operating performance.\n\nPAYX stock also has a relatively high dividend (forward yield of 2.58%). Raising its dividend 8 years in a row, over the past five years it has raised its dividend by an average of 8.53% per year. This stock offers a lot for buy-and-hold investors. It provides a steady return through its dividend. In the years ahead, it could also benefit from steady price appreciation.\n\n7 Oversold Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nThis stock earns an \u201cA\u201d rating in my Portfolio Grader.\n\nSociedad Quimica Y Minera De Chile (SQM)\n\nSociedad Quimica Y Minera De Chile (NYSE:SQM), or SQM for short, is a Chilean fertilizer and mining company. Saying it has been firing on all cylinders lately is an understatement. The company has not only benefited from the boom in fertilizer prices.\n\nA major lithium supplier, it has been benefiting from strong demand, due to its use in the production of electric vehicle (EV) batteries. As a result, its earnings are up substantially. So too, is its stock price. SQM stock is up around 96% since January, and up 112% over the past twelve months.\n\nAfter another big spike late last month, SQM has pulled back. Further weakness may be ahead. However, it has long-term catalysts like the lithium boom on its side. Coupled with a low valuation (forward earnings multiple of 8.8x), and an above-average dividend (4.57%), long-term investors may want to start slowly building up a position.\n\nThis stock earns an \u201cA\u201d rating in my Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier has positions in CF, KR, and SQM in this article.

This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and tap stocks that are high-quality in nature.\n\nWhy Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?\n\nHistorically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn't tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.\n\nAlso, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company's Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.\n\nMeanwhile, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies' financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company's guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.\n\nThus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company's own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.\n\nHow to Find Stocks That Can Beat?\n\nNow, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors' dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.\n\nAn impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company's ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.\n\nStory continues\n\nA handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to five.\n\nHere are all five stocks:\n\nDriven Brands Holdings : It is an automotive services company principally in North America.

But that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t stocks that are worth buying.\n\nThe hot stocks featured here aren\u2019t likely household names, but if you follow my articles with any regularity, many of these may be familiar. These stocks have been doing very well during this mess, largely because they are very focused companies that have been delivering their products to customers reliably for decades.\n\nAnd many of these companies are at the front of the economic chain, helping drive their industries forward without much fanfare from individual consumers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMany of these companies have been soaring year-to-date (YTD) due to increased demand in their sectors and continually rising prices for their goods and services. But this is a great time to use volatility to your advantage and make a move on these companies when the market turns down again. Because it will turn down again.\n\n7 Best Consumer Staples Stocks to Buy in June (That Pay Dividends!)\n\nStart adding on the dips and you\u2019ll have quite a collection when the volatility ends.\n\nTicker Company Current Price BLDR Builders FirstSource $63.94 CF CF Industries $95.78 CVE Cenovus Energy $23.49 ICL ICL Group $10.73 LNTH Lantheus Holdings $67.64 SQM Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile $101.31 WIRE Encore Wire Corp $124.54\n\nBuilders FirstSource (BLDR)\n\nEven as interest rates rise, builders continue to build. This isn\u2019t unusual. And given all the mixed signals we\u2019re seeing in the global economy, it makes perfect sense.\n\nThe economy is overheating (that goes well beyond the U.S.) and we\u2019re sitting at record low levels of unemployment. These aren\u2019t terrible things. So for now, building will continue.\n\nAnd that means Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR) will continue to be a hot stock. It has built a significant footprint supplying builders and developers with the products and services the industry needs to keep up with demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nBLDR stock has been hit hard YTD, losing 24%. But BLDR has still gained 44% in the past 12 months. And that selloff has certainly helped its valuation. Its price-to-earnings ratio is now under 6x.\n\nThis stock has an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.\n\nCF Industries (CF)\n\nAlthough CF Industries (NYSE:CF) has a $21 billion market cap, it\u2019s likely most investors haven\u2019t heard of it before. Well, now is the perfect time to get to know CF.\n\nIt\u2019s a fertilizer company that focuses on nitrogen, ammonia and urea. It also produces ammonium nitrate. These are key products for the agricultural industry around the globe.\n\nCF is a U.S.-based company and has been in business since 1946. It first built a strong relationship with famers in the Midwest and eventually farmers well beyond U.S. shores. Its legacy is also proof that it can weather the booms and busts of the agricultural sector and continue to grow.\n\nCF stock has gained 35% YTD and 73% in the past year. Yet it\u2019s still trading at a P\/E just above 12x and has a 1.7% dividend.\n\n7 Tech Stocks to Buy That Pay Solid Dividends\n\nThis stock has an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.\n\nCenovus Energy (CVE)\n\nUsually in high-profile industries it\u2019s fairly easy to know who the big players are. Everyone talks about them and they end up as the poster children for their respective industries. Energy (NYSE:CVE) has somehow avoided that high-profile status.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be considered one of the energy patch\u2019s hot stocks. This Canada-based company has been an energy pioneer. It started operations in 1881. Oil was discovered in the U.S. in Titusville, Pennsylvania in 1859.\n\nThat means CVE wasn\u2019t far behind in its drive to commercialize oil production in Canada. And the fact that it remains a thriving company with a $43 billion market cap is testament to the management of the company over all these decades.\n\nCVE stock has risen 85% YTD and 163% in the past 12 months. Yet it still has a decent P\/E and a 1.5% dividend. But this is a growth story right now, and continued North American demand is going to boost this stock\u2019s fortunes.\n\nThis stock has an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.\n\nICL Group (ICL)\n\nWhen it comes to mining and producing important industrial commodities, much of that work is done abroad, even by most big U.S. chemical and materials companies.\n\nHowever, ICL Group (NYSE:ICL) is an Israel-based company that has a significant global presence, especially in the bromine, potash and magnesium markets. It has mines in Israel \u2014 the Negev desert in particular \u2014 as well as a number of other countries around the world. Many of its mined chemicals are important components of fertilizers, energy storage and the food industries.\n\nAll these sectors are showing increasing demand intermediate and long term. And given its strategic headquarters, it has easy access to Europe, Asia and Africa.\n\nICL stock has a $14 billion market cap and has been around since 1968. The stock has risen 9% YTD, and 46% in the past 12 months, yet it has a P\/E under 12x.\n\n7 Stocks to Buy to Avoid Being Mauled by a Bear Market\n\nThis stock has an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.\n\nLantheus Holdings (LNTH)\n\nIf there\u2019s one reality that we deal with as we age is the potential onset of cardiovascular disease. Some hardening of the arteries is simply age-related. Some genetic. And some environmental.\n\nAll of those factors put heart disease at the top of the CDC\u2019s list on top killers in 2020. And it usually takes one of the top places every year in the U.S. And that stat isn\u2019t unique to the U.S.\n\nLantheus Holdings (NASDAQ:LNTH) has built its business around diagnostic and therapeutic products and solutions that help healthcare professionals identify disease and improve patient outcomes. Its main line of products are focused on diagnostics for heart, brain, lung and other organs using echocardiography (ECG), nuclear imaging, radiotherapeutics and PET imaging agents.\n\nLNTH stock has a market cap just over $4 billion, but it has been in business since 1956, so it\u2019s a very well established company. That means a lot in the conservative medical sector. It also means LNTH has seen its share of market ups and downs.\n\nThe stock has gained a whopping 170% in the past 12 months, and 127% YTD. Demand has been growing as Covid-19 continues to exacerbate chronic and acute conditions.\n\nThis stock has an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM)\n\nSimilar to ICL, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) not only launched in 1968 but it\u2019s also a global player in the chemicals sector. Its name translated is the Chemical and Mining Society of Chile. And that\u2019s exactly what it is.\n\nOne of the chemicals it mines is lithium. SQM is on of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of lithium because Chile has significant lithium reserves. This is important not only for the production of energy storage for electric vehicles and renewables, but it\u2019s also in the U.S.\u2019s sphere of influence.\n\nChina has major lithium deposits, but considering the strategic games at play between the U.S. and China, having access to non-Chinese lithium is essential. SQM makes that a reality. Its fertilizer segment is also firing on all cylinders.\n\nThat\u2019s why SQM stock has soared 124% in the past 12 months, and 97% YTD. And it\u2019s why SQM is on our hot stocks list. SQM also still has a 3% dividend yield. Buy in slowly over time.\n\n7 Tech Stocks to Buy That Pay Solid Dividends\n\nThis stock has an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.\n\nEncore Wire Corp (WIRE)\n\nWhen it comes to nearly any type of construction, telecom or infrastructure project the one thing they all have in common is wire. That is also true for numerous consumer devices and durable goods as well.\n\nAnd that\u2019s precisely what Encore Wire Corp (NASDAQ:WIRE) produces: wires of all types for commercial and industrial use. This may seem like a relatively simple business, but it\u2019s as complex and diverse as say, glass manufacturing.\n\nWIRE isn\u2019t a big firm. It has a $2.5 billion market cap, but it\u2019s a very strategic company that should benefit from economic expansion. The stock has gained 49% in the past 12 months, but has lost 12% YTD due to rate increases, among other issues. It\u2019s on the hot stocks list because it\u2019s now on sale and will win big in coming quarters.\n\nThis stock has an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier has positions in BLDR, CF, CVE, ICL, LNTH, SQM and WIRE in this article.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nThe best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\n\nCurrently, both Nutrien and SQM are holding a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P\/E ratio, P\/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\n\nNTR currently has a forward P\/E ratio of 5.83, while SQM has a forward P\/E of 14.23. We also note that NTR has a PEG ratio of 0.73. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P\/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. SQM currently has a PEG ratio of 0.80.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for NTR is its P\/B ratio of 2.15. The P\/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, SQM has a P\/B of 9.22.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help NTR earn a Value grade of B, while SQM has been given a Value grade of F.\n\nBoth NTR and SQM are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that NTR is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SQM.\n\nSurvive Financial Armageddon Using the Zacks Rank\n\nThere's little doubt that what we are witnessing in the stock market right now is a nasty bear market. While the S&P 500 has yet to officially post a close 20% from its peak, the blue-chip index continues to hover right around those levels. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is now down over -30% from its peak last November.\n\nWhereas the coronavirus pandemic-induced plunge was extremely swift (more along the lines of a waterfall decline), this fall in stocks has been fairly orderly and more in sync with what we've seen in past bear markets. There's a myriad of factors that are pulling down equity prices, not least of which is a declining earnings outlook. We've seen many stocks get absolutely punished recently for either missing earnings or guiding weak.\n\nThat's why it's so important to target companies whose earnings picture is actually improving in this market environment. Positive earnings estimate revisions are at the heart of the Zacks Rank, and investors can use this system to find companies that are primed to surge in price \u2013 even when most stocks are falling.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assists investors in locating groups of stocks whose earnings outlook is improving. One of the ways we can decide which individual stocks to include in our portfolio is by targeting stocks in different industry groups. This also has the added benefit of helping to diversify our portfolio.\n\nThe Zacks Fertilizers industry currently ranks in the top 2% out of approximately 250 industries. Because this group is ranked in the top half of all industries, we expect it to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. This group has returned 42.48% this year while the market has been in correction mode.\n\nThe projected EPS growth looks particularly promising. By targeting stocks within leading industry groups, we can put the odds in our favor and improve our investing results. Let's take a look at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock within this top industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nSociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile S.A.\n\nSociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera produces and distributes specialty plant nutrients and fertilizers globally. SQM provides potassium chloride and sulfate for crops such as corn, rice, wheat, and sugar. The company also manufactures industrial chemicals and iodine derivative products. In addition, SQM offers lithium carbonates for various applications such as materials for batteries, air-conditioning chemicals, and heat-resistant glass. Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera was incorporated in 1968 and is headquartered in Santiago, Chile.\n\nSQM has exceeded earnings estimates in each of the past two quarters. The fertilizer producer most recently reported Q1 EPS last week of $2.79, a 126.83% surprise over the $1.23 consensus estimate. The company has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 28.19%, aiding the stock's 140% return over the past year.\n\nAnalysts are in agreement in terms of earnings revisions and have bolstered estimates across the board. For the current quarter, EPS estimates were raised 83.02% in the past 60 days. The Q2 Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $1.94, translating to an astounding 525.81% growth rate relative to the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, analysts have increased EPS estimates by 49.03% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is now $6.93, reflecting potential growth of 238.05% versus 2021.\n\nMake sure to put SQM on your watchlist if you haven't already done so.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nOur 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

News Oil Rig China\n\nThe executive director of the IEA, Fatih Birol, warned that given the current supply\/demand situation, there is only one thing that can stop prices from surging higher and that is Chinese demand remaining weak over the upcoming months.\n\n- According to Platts estimates, China\u2019s April demand plummeted to 13.35 million b\/d, down 11.5% year-on-year, though recovering transportation demand will push May figures back above 14 million b\/d.\n\n- At the peak of lockdown mandates, gasoline and diesel demand in coastal regions dropped by as much as 40%, with a grand total of 45 cities with some form of movement restrictions.\n\n- The market anticipates strong stimulus measures from Beijing that would increase China\u2019s oil demand by 4% year-on-year, adding 600,000 b\/d on the year in the second half of 2022, though this might still be subject to downward revision if the zero-COVID policy remains in place.\n\nMarket Movers\n\n- Jair Bolsonaro, the president of Brazil, fired the CEO of a Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) - the second in two months - after he warned of an impending diesel crisis in the country.\n\n- Ahead of ExxonMobil\u2019s (NYSE:XOM) annual general meeting this Wednesday, UK proxy adviser PIRC urged shareholders to oust Darren Woods as company CEO, saying his continued serving in the role represents a dangerous concentration of power.\n\n- Italy\u2019s ENI (NYSE:E) and France\u2019s TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE)started the exploratory drilling of a natural gas well in Block 06 offshore Cyprus, almost four years after the 8 TCf Calypso discovery.\n\nTuesday, May 24, 2022\n\nThe combination of physical tightness and robust demand is keeping oil prices near the $110 mark. This week, gasoline prices are likely to garner plenty of attention as inventories continue to drop and US drivers gear up for Memorial Day weekend travel. This is all coming at a time when RBOB futures are seeing record-high levels of backwardation. The prospect of Chinese demand gradually bouncing back and the EU finally agreeing to sanctions on Russian oil is only adding to the upside risk for oil prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nEU Signals Potential Sanctions Breakthrough Soon. The prime ministers of Germany and the Netherlands have announced that the sixth package of EU sanctions on Russia, sanctions that should contain an oil ban, could be reached within a few days, hinting at a potential settlement with Hungary.\n\nWhite House Might Release Diesel SPR Stocks. The Biden Administration is mulling an emergency release of diesel inventories held in the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve, roughly 1 million barrels, to tame soaring fuel prices as the national average price of diesel reached $5.56 a gallon.\n\nWeakening European Demand Puts Asia in LNG Driving Seat Again. With European purchases of liquefied natural gas ebbing on the back of stable inventories and warm weather, intensifying pre-summer buying of Asian consumers like China and Japan has been gradually pushing spot prices to $23 per mmBtu, though still some $3\/mmBtu below European TTF figures.\n\nChina Opens Up to Australia. Two years after China\u2019s discontent with Australia led to Beijing banning its coal exports, Chinese prime minister Li Keqiang indicated a willingness to work with the newly-elected government of Labor leader Anthony Albanese, the first senior communication between the countries in two years.\n\nRussia Wants Joint Refineries with BRICS Countries. Russia\u2019s industry minister Denis Manturov flaunted the idea of establishing joint oil and gas refining facilities with other BRICS nations (Brazil, India, China, and South Africa) to ease their dependence on \u201cunreliable partners\u201d.\n\nNorway Just Cannot Restart Arctic LNG Project. Following a fire incident in September 2020, Norwegian oil major Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) has been struggling to bring its Hammerfest LNG plant back, postponing its restart once again to May 27 after a compressor failure.\n\nIran Revives Oman Subsea Gas Project. Iran\u2019s oil ministry is seeking to revive a long-stalled $60 billion project to lay a subsea pipeline that would carry Iranian gas to Oman, delayed by pricing disagreements and the US\u2019 reimposition of sanctions against Teheran in 2018.\n\nRelated: Poland Says Norway Should Share Its \u201cGigantic\u201d Oil & Gas Profits\n\nPetrobras Mulls Upstream Expansion. Brazil\u2019s state-controlled oil firm Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) will reportedly invest $16 billion over the next five years to stall natural declines at post-salt fields in the Campos Basin, despite increasing pressure from President Bolsonaro to tame runaway fuel prices.\n\nChile Wants Lithium State Firm by Year-End. Chile\u2019s government pledged to establish a state lithium firm by the end of this year, potentially squeezing the market share of Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) and SQM (NYSE:SQM), though recent utterances have hinted at potential private participation in the new company.\n\nArgentina Output Soars to 10-Year Maximum. Argentina\u2019s crude production rose to the highest level since 2011, averaging 578,000 b\/d in April with the share of Vaca Muerta shale output rising to more than 40% of the national total.\n\nGermany Wants to Keep Idled Coal Plants on Standby. Wary of potential power crunches, the German government is planning to keep some 8.5 GW of coal-fired generation capacity that is due to be idled in 2022-2023 in standby mode, with operators compensated from public funds for holding feedstock ready.\n\nTrinidad Wants its Refinery Back. The government of Trinidad and Tobago picked an unnamed bidder to restart and operate its 165,000 b\/d Guaracara refinery, shuttered since November 2018, saying that it would seek to process crude from neighboring Guyana.\n\nUK Mulls Windfall Tax on Oil & Gas. With UK power prices spinning out of control and the price cap set to reach \u00a32,800 ($3,500) in October, the government in London is considering imposing a windfall tax on oil and gas companies that fail to make \u2018significant investment\u2019 into renewables.\n\nBy Tom Kool for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:\n\nBiden Could Tap Diesel Reserve In A Bid To Ease Fuel Crunch Oil Markets Are Bracing For A Slew Of Bullish News World Sees First Global Energy Shock: World Energy Council\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/gasoline-prices-set-spike-week-190000537.html","symbols":["ALB.US","E.US","EQNR.US","HO.COMM","NG.COMM","PBR-A.US","PBR.US","PBRN.MX","PETR3.SA","PETR4.SA","PJX.F","PJXA.F","PJXB.F","PJXC.F","RB.COMM","SQM.US","TTE.US","XOM.US"],"tags":["CHINA","CHINESE DEMAND","FATIH BIROL","GASOLINE PRICES","INVENTORIES","JAIR BOLSONARO","MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND","OIL PRICES","PETROBRAS","PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL"],"sentiment":{"polarity":-0.926,"neg":0.079,"neu":0.856,"pos":0.065}},{"date":"2022-05-24T16:59:04+00:00","title":"Survive the Financial Armageddon Using the Zacks Rank","content":"There\u2019s little doubt that what we are witnessing in the stock market right now is a nasty bear market.

(NYSE:SQM) Outlook for This Year","content":"Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) shareholders will have a reason to smile today, with the analysts making substantial upgrades to this year's forecasts. The consensus statutory numbers for both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) increased, with their view clearly much more bullish on the company's business prospects. The market may be pricing in some blue sky too, with the share price gaining 25% to US$95.23 in the last 7 days. It will be interesting to see if today's upgrade is enough to propel the stock even higher.\n\nFollowing the upgrade, the latest consensus from Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile's eleven analysts is for revenues of US$8.7b in 2022, which would reflect a sizeable 101% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to shoot up 150% to US$11.47. Prior to this update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$5.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.14 in 2022. So we can see there's been a pretty clear increase in analyst sentiment in recent times, with both revenues and earnings per share receiving a decent lift in the latest estimates.\n\nView our latest analysis for Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nWith these upgrades, we're not surprised to see that the analysts have lifted their price target 16% to US$93.64 per share. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. There are some variant perceptions on Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$136 and the most bearish at US$50.00 per share. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's clear from the latest estimates that Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 153% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2022 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 5.3% p.a. over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 3.7% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile is expected to grow much faster than its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe biggest takeaway for us from these new estimates is that analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, with improved earnings power expected for this year. Fortunately, analysts also upgraded their revenue estimates, and our data indicates sales are expected to perform better than the wider market. Given that the consensus looks almost universally bullish, with a substantial increase to forecasts and a higher price target, Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile could be worth investigating further.\n\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have estimates - from multiple Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile analysts - going out to 2024, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nAnother way to search for interesting companies that could be  reaching an inflection point is to track whether management are buying or selling, with our free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

(SQM) (NYSE: SQM; Santiago Stock Exchange: SQM-B, SQM-A) reported earnings today for the three months ended March 31, 2022 of US$796.1 million (US$2.79 per share), an increase from US$68.0 million (US$0.26 per share) reported for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Gross profit reached US$1,164.7 million (57.7% of revenues) for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to US$136.6 million (25.9% of revenues) recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Revenues totaled US$2,019.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, an increase compared to the US$528.5 reported for the three months ended March 31, 2021.\n\nSQM's Chief Executive Officer, Ricardo Ramos, stated:\u00a0\"Our first quarter results reflect several positive circumstances; first, the impact of higher prices in all our business lines, where significant increases in lithium prices stand out, and second, the successful long-term, operational and commercial strategy.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated to our operations in the Salar de Atacama, it is important to remember that SQM began this project by acquiring the participation from producers from Chile and the United States in 1993. Before our acquisition, there had been seven years of investments and studies by these companies. We assumed the risk, developed, invested and executed the project. It has not been an easy task; the natural resource was not well known, and our project has had its ups and downs. Mining activities require long periods of development, dialogue and collaboration with the neighboring communities, relevant investments from shareholders and, above all, a strong team to innovate and develop technologies to operate the natural resource.\"\n\nToday we can proudly report that we are a leader in the lithium industry. We have almost tripled our production levels in three years while we have significantly decreased the extraction of brines. We are the most integrated lithium producer in its country of origin, delivering high-quality products that can be used directly in the production of high-end battery components.\n\nOur first quarter results include payments related to the agreement with Corfo and tax provisions that totaled approximately US$800 million. In total, the amount is similar to the earnings reported by all of our business during the first quarter of this year.\n\nSQM's lithium business is a very good example of a successful public-private partnership. No other operation delivers more resources proportionally to Chilean coffers; approximately 60% of the operating margin from lithium is dedicated to payments to Corfo and taxes.\"\n\nMr. Ramos finished by saying: \"We continue to permanently analyze new ideas and study new projects in all our businesses. We will review our investment plan in the coming months, and we should update our projections following that review. It is very likely that we will increase the resources oriented to the development of business in Chile and abroad.\"\n\nSustainable Development\n\nIn April 2022 we published our audited 2021 Sustainability Report. For the twelfth consecutive year, the information was presented under the GRI standards (Global Standard Initiative)\u00a0and for first time, under SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) standards. We would like to highlight that SQM's workforce is made up of approximately 19% women, in an industry where the average in Chile is 13%. Furthermore, 30% of the executive positions at SQM are filled by women. We are proud that in the Northern regions of Chile, our we employment base is over 82% local.\n\nWe continue to keep sustainability at the core of the company and during 2021 we were able to reduce our carbon emissions 28% per ton when compared to 2020. Specific to the lithium production, we reduced direct water consumption for lithium carbonate approximately 27% in 2021 when compared to 2020.\n\nWe invite you to read our Sustainability Report in detail to learn more about all of our environmental and social efforts.

It has also asked the firm to further justify the losses it has sustained from its hedging business.\n\n\"Please clarify the reason and justification for the losses incurred by your hedging business over the past three years,\" the exchange said in an inquiry letter published on its website on Monday. It also asked Tianqi to demonstrate whether its employees had \"engaged in high-risk futures investment\" without complying with the firm's internal risk limits.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Morgan Stanley is a joint sponsor of the deal along with CICC and CMB International.\n\nA file photo of brine pools at SQM's lithium mine on the Atacama salt flat in northern Chile. Photo: Reuters alt=A file photo of brine pools at SQM's lithium mine on the Atacama salt flat in northern Chile. Photo: Reuters>\n\nTianqi's Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) application is under review. Generally, it takes at least six month for an applicant to proceed to the stage where the listing committee of bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing gives its approval, after which the firm proceeds to an IPO.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe US$159 million loan contracts in question involved two \"variable prepaid forward contracts\" that it had entered into with Morgan Stanley in 2019, for which Tianqi pledged more than 5.3 million shares of Chilean lithium miner Sociedad Quimica y Minera De Chile (SQM) it owned.\n\nTianqi acquired a minority stake in SQM back in 2018 for US$4.1 billion. It still owns about 23.7 per cent of SQM, according to its Hong Kong IPO draft prospectus.\n\nThe contracts had embedded options that were tied to SQM share prices. The shares pledged represented SQM's American depositary shares trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Tianqi took the loan after the SQM acquisition loaded it with debt, so much so that finance costs incurred from the loan and borrowings amounted to 42.5 per cent and 57.1 per cent of its total revenue in 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n\nTianqi opted for the complex option-embedded contracts with Morgan Stanley as this allowed it to obtain the highest loan amount for a three-year term, according to a filing with the Shenzhen exchange in January.\n\nThe options had a series of expiry dates that kicked in starting January this year and Tianqi said that it had opted to repay the loan contracts by delivering SQM shares to Morgan Stanley, instead of cash. \"By repaying the loan through delivering shares, it would cause the least impact to the company's profit and loss account,\" it said in a statement issued in January.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what losses these option-linked loan contracts had caused for Tianqi. But before the contracts' expiry, the embedded options had already led to a 176.4 million yuan loss for the nine months of 2020, according to the firm's draft IPO prospectus.\n\nThe company said it would use the proceeds from its Hong Kong IPO to repay a US$3.5 billion syndicated loan taken out in 2018 to fund the SQM acquisition.\n\nTianqi, Jiangxi-based Ganfeng, SQM and US-based Albemarle are the big four players in the sector and produced almost half of the world's refined lithium product supply in 2020, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

SQM will release first-quarter 2022 results after the closing bell on May 18.\r\n\r\nThe company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the last four quarters while beat once and posted in-line result on the other occasion. It has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of around 3.5%, on average. It posted a positive earnings surprise of 16.5% in the last reported quarter.

Higher sales volumes in lithium, specialty plant nutrition, potassium chloride, iodine and potassium businesses are expected to have aided its top line and margins in the quarter.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of lithium operations is expected to have supported the company\u2019s lithium sales volumes. Strong demand and limited supply are also likely to have boosted lithium prices in the March quarter. Iodine volumes are also expected to have been supported by growing demand following the post-pandemic recovery.\r\n\r\nGlobal potassium prices are also expected to have been driven by the shortage of potassium-based fertilizers. This is likely to have boosted prices in the company\u2019s potassium business lines in the first quarter. Higher demand is likely to have backed the increase in prices of potassium chloride.\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera S.A. Price and EPS Surprise Sociedad Quimica y Minera S.A.

Recent estimates from McKinsey suggest a global demand of around 3 million metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2030. In contrast, the total global LCE output for 2021 amounted to only 540,000 metric tons, a mere 18% of the anticipated need for 2030. These figures point to a potential shortfall in the future and questions are being raised over how this demand will be met.\n\nThe rise in this demand is attributed to an increase in consumer demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs). These EVs are requiring batteries that have higher energy densities and longer lifespans, the main component of which is high-grade lithium. The sudden rise in demand has caused raw lithium prices to skyrocket, leaving battery producers scrambling to secure their supply of a commodity that is quickly entering into a shortage. So this begs the question: Which companies are best positioned to take advantage? Mined production volume, modelled for 93% available capacity. Source: Minespans, McKinsey lithium demand model\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)\n\nAlbemarle is a global leader in the extraction and production of lithium, bromine and refining catalyst solutions. Lithium is undoubtedly the largest branch of the business, accounting for 42% of the US$3.3B in net sales for the 2021 calendar year. \r\nAt a current output of 88,000 metric tons of LCE per year, Albemarle asserts itself as a dominant player in the lithium market at 16% total market share. The company is poised to continue in a strong market popsition with plans expand processing infrastructure in 2022 and with the long-term goal of more than doubling their lithium production capacity. With this expansion pipeline, they'll be targeting low-cost juristictions to reduce capital expenditure and impove returns.\n\nHere are where we see Albemarle\u2019s competitive advantage lay:\n\nProject feasibility. Albemarle has proved it can already economically produce battery grade lithium in a period where lithium prices were much lower, illustrating the company\u2019s ability to continue operations should lithium prices fall. Ability to be self-funded. Albemarle's lithium branch is already profit making, so earnings can be retained and capital can be invested into the aforementioned expansion projects without the need for significant capital raises or taking on large amounts of debt. Smaller companies and emerging players will have to undergo financing stages which carry risks and may result in shareholder dilution.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlbemarle has a firm grasp on the market and seems positioned to continue riding this lithium wave from strength to strength. But these factors don\u2019t paint the full picture and investors should always consider the financials of a company to inform their assessment.

Producing 101,000 metric tons of LCE during 2021, SQM\u2019s impressive output accounts for 18.7% of global lithium production for the year and with several project expansions in the works, this output will continue to scale with the market demand.\n\nAccording to SQM\u2019s latest earnings report, 2022 sales estimates top out at 140,000 metric tons of lithium, with capacity potentially reaching 190,000-200,000 should expansion projects be completed in time, and dependant on the market demand for lithium.\n\nHere are the key factors driving the company forward in the next few years:\n\nSignificant Expansion pipeline. With SQM\u2019s joint venture in Mt Holland expecting to enter production in 2024 and a drastic increase to the production capabilities of their Salar del Carmen project, there\u2019s ample opportunity for the company to grow their presence in the market and beat out new entrants. Variable exposure to lithium prices. Looking forward to 2022, SQM\u2019s sales contracts are detailed as follows: 20% fixed or variable price, 50% variable price with a ceiling and 30% not contracted. This means that SQM will still be exposed to the increase in lithium prices on previously negotiated contracts even if the price of lithium was lower at the time the contract was agreed upon, opening the company up to increased revenues.\n\nInvestors should always consider the risks and financial health of a company to inform their investment decision. You can see our rundown of SQM\u2019s risks and financials for free on our website .\n\nLivent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM)\n\nLivent\u2019s premier resource is located in Salar Del Hombre Muerto in Argentina, achieving a reasonable current output of 27,000 metric tons of Lithium Carbonate and Lithium Chloride. While this is modest in comparison to the big players in the sector, expansion is at the forefront of the company\u2019s mission, with a 20,0000 metric tons expansion of their Argentinian operation slated for 2023 and a further 20,000 metric tons anticipated for 2025.\n\nLivent\u2019s production figures account for around 5% of the total market share. While this lags the other two companies, Livent\u2019s key focus on cost leadership within the production of LCE, Lithium Hydroxide and Lithium Chloride should provide an advantage over its peers.\n\nThese are the factors that are important to the performance of Livent:\n\nLow cost focus. High lithium prices can make many more projects economically feasible, but striving for lower operating costs will mean a project can weather the storm if demand and prices fall. By securing a low-impurity lithium resource, Livent has allowed processing costs to be cut, giving a competitive advantage over other brine operations. Exposure to Lithium Carbonate, Lithium Chloride and Lithium Hydroxide prices. New high-density batteries are more compatible with lithium hydroxide owing to greater nickel content in the cathodes. Should primary lithium demand switch from carbonate to hydroxide, Livent\u2019s exposure to the prices in both products should help it navigate pricing volatility.\n\nLivent is a smaller company and that does carry some possible risks. Investors who are interested in finding out more can do so for free on our website .\n\nThe Future Prospects\n\nWhen you take a step back and look at the global lithium sector, you begin to see a trend. Most supply comes from a select few companies, leaving a mass of newcomers are scrambling to secure funding to bring their projects to market. After all, there\u2019s no shortage of lithium resources on Earth, just a shortage of processing power to extract it from the ground and refine it. New companies coming to the table will reach maturity and begin reaping the rewards of their capital investments. These next few companies aren\u2019t generating significant revenues but we believe they\u2019ll be ones to watch.\n\nLithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC)\n\nLithium Americas is an emerging player in the sector. Their flagship project is their Cauchari-Olaroz brine resource in Argentina, which is currently 85% through the construction of its Stage 1 production facility, targeting 40,000 metric tons per annum (tpa) of battery-grade lithium carbonate. Lithium Americas is striving for cost leadership, forecasting operating expenditure of US$3,600 per metric tonne. With a project life of 40 years and a second stage expansion already on the cards, there is plenty to keep investors following their developments closely.\n\nHere are some of the Lithium Americas\u2019 most eye-catching features:\n\nCompleted acquisition of Millennial Lithium in January 2022. Lithium Americas now has 100% ownership of the advanced-stage Pastos Grandes project, which is located nearby to their Cauchar\u00ed-Olaroz tenements. The transaction was completed for around US$400 million and provides Lithium Americas with exposure to a rich brine resource of 4.1 million metric tonnes of LCE. Continued development of Thacker Pass resource. Lithium Americas has a 100% stake in one of the largest resources in the United States. The project\u2019s feasibility study is due in the second half of 2022, targeting 40,000 tpa of lithium carbonate, with scenarios being assessed for expansion up to a total of 80,0000 tpa. Preparation work to begin construction of the initial infrastructure is set to commence in 2022.\n\nFor those who are eager to find out more, you can do so by taking a look at the future growth section in our company report for Lithium Americas on our website .\n\nPiedmont Lithium Inc. (NASDAQ:PLL)\n\nPiedmont Lithium Inc. is a lithium company looking to develop key strategic assets in North Carolina, Quebec and Ghana. With a consolidated enterprise targeting 60,000 tonnes of LiOH per year and an additional 390,000 tonnes per year in spodumene concentrate (SC6) production, Piedmont is looking to become a significant player in America\u2019s shift to newer energy initiatives.\n\nHere is why Piedmont Lithium\u2019s future may become interesting:\n\nEntered into a binding agreement with Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to supply spodumene concentrate from their North Carolina project. The agreement is for an initial five-year term on a fixed price commitment representing one-third of Piedmont\u2019s planned production from their North Carolina project. Deliveries planned to begin between July 2022 and July 2023, but timeline has been postponed indefinitely due to delays in development. The Carolina project offers industry leading sustainability with close proximity to a key target market. Piedmont owns 100% of the project which is set to lead the way in terms of cost and sustainability, offering much lower direct water usage in the processing of lithium hydroxide, requiring only 6,300 gallons per tonne of LiOH. Compare this to Chilean projects in the Atacama region which need up to 124,000 gallons of water per tonne, it\u2019s clear to see where the benefits lay for Piedmont as water scarcity continues to be a frequent discussion point into the future.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to find out about the growth estimates for Piedmont Lithium Inc. (NASDAQ:PLL), we encourage you to take a deep dive into our coverage of analysts\u2019 estimates for the company in our company report .\n\nStandard Lithium Ltd.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Diodes (NASDAQ:DIOD) so let's look a bit deeper.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Diodes is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.19 = US$320m \u00f7 (US$2.2b - US$463m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nSo, Diodes has an ROCE of 19%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Semiconductor industry average of 14% it's much better.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Diodes  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Diodes compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Diodes here  for free.\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Diodes Tell Us?\n\nWe like the trends that we're seeing from Diodes. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 19%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 26% more capital is being employed now too. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Diodes has. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Diodes can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a final note, we've found  2 warning signs for Diodes that we think you should be aware of.\n\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this freelist of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile's  ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nView our latest analysis for Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile is:\n\n18% = US$592m \u00f7 US$3.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.18.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nSociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile's Earnings Growth And 18% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 16%. For this reason, Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile's five year net income decline of 6.5% raises the question as to why the decent ROE didn't translate into growth. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat being said, we compared Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 7.3% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nIs Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nSociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile has a high three-year median payout ratio of 89% (that is, it is retaining 11% of its profits). This suggests that the company is paying most of its profits as dividends to its shareholders. This goes some way in explaining why its earnings have been shrinking. With only a little being reinvested into the business, earnings growth would obviously be low or non-existent. To know the 3 risks we have identified for Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile visit our risks dashboard for free.\n\nMoreover, Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 68% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 69%, over the same period.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we do feel that Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile has some positive attributes. However, while the company does have a high ROE, its earnings growth number is quite disappointing. This can be blamed on the fact that it reinvests only a small portion of its profits and pays out the rest as dividends. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

(ASIX) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?","content":"AdvanSix Inc. ASIX is scheduled to report first-quarter 2022 results before the opening bell on May 6.\r\n\r\nThe company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters while missed once. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 23.6%, on average. It posted a negative earnings surprise of around 1.2% in the last reported quarter. The company\u2019s first-quarter results are likely to reflect strong demand across a number of end markets, growth of its differentiated products and higher prices.\r\n\r\nThe stock has rallied 47.5% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 19.3% decline. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nWhat Do the Estimates Say?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter consolidated revenues for AdvanSix is currently pegged at $482 million, which calls for a rise of around 28% year over year.\n\nSome Factors at Play\n\nThe company is expected to have benefited from healthy end-market demand and growth of its differentiated products in the quarter to be reported. It is seeing a recovery in demand across a number of markets including automotive, building & construction, electronics and packaging and is also gaining from strong agricultural industry fundamentals. Favorable market conditions and tight industry supply are likely to have supported demand for nylon in North America. Strong demand for chemical intermediates is also likely to have continued across a number of markets in the March quarter.\r\n\r\nHigher demand for its product lines is expected to have supported its volumes in the first quarter. Higher prices are also expected to have driven its top line. However, the company is likely to have faced headwinds from higher raw material costs and supply-chain disruptions in the quarter to be reported.\n\nAdvanSix Price and EPS Surprise AdvanSix Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAdvanSix price-eps-surprise | AdvanSix Quote\n\nZacks Model\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for AdvanSix this season.

Russia is one of the world's biggest exporters of key raw materials, from crude oil and gas to wheat and aluminum, and the possible exclusion of supplies from the country due to sanctions has sent traders and importers into a frenzy.\n\nBase metals prices have been coming off recent highs (and in the case of aluminum, copper and tin, all-time highs) set earlier in the month that were spurred by fears over the potential for disruption to Russia\u2019s metal exports following its invasion of Ukraine. Broad-based supply concerns remain, ranging from the potential for sanctions targeting exports, to actual output disruption and logistical dislocations (see \u2018Implications of the Russia-Ukraine crisis for metals\u2019 for details).\n\nBut the Ukraine crisis is only layering onto another more powerful trend: the global transition to low-carbon energy.\n\nThe energy transition is driving the next commodity supercycle, with immense prospects for technology manufacturers, energy traders, and investors. Clean energy technologies require more metals than their fossil fuel-based counterparts, with prices of green metals projected to reach historical peaks for an unprecedented, sustained period in a net-zero emissions scenario.\n\nBut few, if any, green metals have witnessed a price explosion as epic as that of lithium.\n\nAfter more than quadrupling in value last year, lithium carbonate continues to soar in 2022 according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.\n\nThe rally in lithium hydroxide, used in high-nickel content cathode manufacture, is accelerating, up 120% so far this year, narrowing the discount to lithium carbonate, which historically is priced below hydroxide.\n\nBenchmark says that Chinese inventory levels for hydroxide, carbonate, and spodumene feedstock remain very low, sustaining the high price environment. Many investors who got burned by the last lithium price bust of 2018 have probably been watching on the sidelines, not sure what to make of the current mega-rally.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated: Norway Plans Record Gas Volumes For Europe\n\nTo be fair, China's spot market, where small tonnages can have big price impacts, may be accentuating the scale of this mega-rally, but make no mistake about it: this is no false flag, with everything from mined spodumene to high-purity hydroxide, and every component of the lithium processing chain experiencing a wild price surge. The price explosion tells you that lithium supply is simply nowhere near enough to feed this demand surge.\n\nWith earnings season here with us again,\u00a0 the famous lithium trio of Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM), FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) and Albermale (NYSE:ALB) will be heavily scrutinized. However, only SQM has really impressed with a 51.4% return so far this year, with FMC and ALB returning 9.9% and -12.7%, respectively, over the timeframe. The three companies are some of the largest in the business, with SQM boasting a $21.1B market cap, FMC is worth $16.7B while ALB is valued at $22.6B.\n\nLuckily, scores of lithium juniors have been responding more readily to the lithium price boom. Here are some that have been outstanding so far this year.\n\n#1. Lithium Energy Exploration Inc.\n\nMarket Cap: $14.7M\n\nYTD Returns: 328.6%\n\nHeadquartered in Toronto, Canada, Lithium Energi Exploration Inc. (OTCPK:LXENF)(TSXV:LEXI) engages in the acquisition, exploration, and development of lithium brine assets in Argentina. The company holds interests in the Laguna Caro project that includes eight mineral concessions covering approximately 17,759 hectares; the Antofalla North project that consists of thirteen mineral concessions covering approximately 41,496 hectares; and the Antofalla South project that includes eighteen mineral concessions covering 69,112 hectares in Argentina.\n\nIncorporated in 1998, Lithium Energi was formerly known as Portola Resources Inc. and changed its name to Lithium Energi Exploration Inc. in March 2017.\n\nBack in January, Lithium Energi Exploration announced that, under its JV Agreement with Global Oil Management Group, LLC (\"GOMG\"), implementation of exploration and development plans have been accelerating rapidly.\n\nLEXI reported that it\u2019s a\u00a0 20% non-dilutable stakeholder in the JV and that development is slated to commence immediately, with the Sorcia Group owning the exclusive license to utilize the International Battery Metals Ltd\u2019s (OTCPK:BATF) technology in Argentina and Chile. IBAT further stated that it has substantially completed the construction of its first lithium extraction unit and the system modules are currently being heat traced and insulated with final assembly and testing to take place in March in the U.S. prior to deployment to South America.\n\nRelated: Oil Prices Hit $110 As Europe Prepares To Ban Russian Crude\n\n#2. Sayona Mining Limited\n\nMarket Cap: $1.6B\n\nYTD Returns: 111.1%\n\nPaddington, Australia-based Sayona Mining Limited (OTCQB:SYAXF), together with its subsidiaries, engages in mineral exploration and development in Australia and Canada. The company explores for lithium, graphite, and gold deposits. Its flagship project is the Authier Lithium Project located in Quebec, Canada. The company also holds a 60% interest in the Moblan lithium project located in Northern Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nLast year, Sayona Mining reported that the Superior Court of Quebec approved its joint bid with Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) for the acquisition of North American Lithium, which owns a previously producing lithium project near Sayona's core Authier project.\n\nMore than $400M had been spent on the project, which was operational and ramping toward nameplate production in 2018 but then was placed on care and maintenance due to weak lithium markets and a shaky capital structure.\n\nSayona and Piedmont say they are proceeding with technical studies that would prepare for the integration of Sayona's Authier and Tansim projects with the facilities at NAL.\n\n#3. Frontier Lithium Inc.\n\nMarket Cap: $578.6M\n\nYTD Returns: 76.1%\n\nVal Caron, Canada-based Frontier Lithium Inc. (OTCQX:LITOF) engages in the acquisition, exploration, and development of mining properties in Canada. The company primarily holds a 100% interest in the PAK Lithium project, which covers 1,378 contiguous mining claim units totaling 26,774 hectares located in northwestern Ontario, Canada.\n\nFrontier has forged a strategic partnership agreement with XPS Expert Process Solutions to develop a process to refine spodumene concentrate into lithium hydroxide. Further, Frontier Lithium owns 100% of the PAK Lithium Project, located in northwestern Ontario. This is a very high-grade spodumene resource with low iron and low impurities. The PEA post-tax NPV8% is estimated at US$974.6m based on producing 23,174tpa LiOH.\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nThe U.S. Shale Patch Is Facing A Plethora Of Problems  Europe May Lose The Energy Transition Race Before It Really Begins  Upstream Oil Industry To See Highest Profits Ever In 2022\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/3-impressive-lithium-stocks-flying-230000351.html","symbols":["ALB.US","AMC.F","CL.COMM","FMC.US","FMQ.F","GC.COMM","HG.COMM","KW.COMM","PLL.US","QYM.F","SQM.US","SYA.AU","ZG.COMM"],"tags":["CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES","FMC CORPORATION","LITHIUM CARBONATE","LITHIUM HYDROXIDE","SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.995,"neg":0.05,"neu":0.847,"pos":0.103}},{"date":"2022-05-04T20:05:00+00:00","title":"Diodes Incorporated Reports Record First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Financial Results","content":"Achieves Record Revenue for 6th Consecutive Quarter and Record Gross Margin of 40.8%, Driving Record Profits from Operations and EPS\n\nPLANO, Texas, May 04, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Diodes Incorporated (Diodes) (Nasdaq: DIOD) today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022.\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nAnnounced the proposed acquisition of the onsemi wafer fabrication facility, which is expected to close in late second quarter of 2022; Revenue was a record $482.1 million, increasing 16.7 percent from $413.1 million in the first quarter 2021 and 0.4 percent from $480.2 million in the fourth quarter 2021; GAAP gross profit was a record $196.7 million, increasing 41.9 percent from $138.6 million in the first quarter 2021 and 3.1 percent from $190.7 million in the fourth quarter 2021; GAAP gross profit margin was a record 40.8 percent, an increase of 720 basis points from the 33.6 percent in the first quarter 2021 and 110 basis points from the 39.7 percent in the fourth quarter 2021; GAAP net income was a record $72.7 million, compared to $39.5 million in the first quarter 2021 and $65.5 million in the fourth quarter 2021; Non-GAAP adjusted net income was a record $80.3 million, compared to $42.0 million in the first quarter 2021 and $73.3 million in the fourth quarter 2021; GAAP EPS was a record $1.59 per diluted share, an 82.8 percent improvement from the $0.87 per diluted share in the first quarter 2021 and a 11.2 percent increase compared to $1.43 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2021; Non-GAAP EPS was a record $1.75 per diluted share, an 88.2 percent improvement from the $0.93 per diluted share in the prior year quarter and a 9.4 percent increase from the $1.60 per diluted share last quarter; Excluding $6.4 million, net of tax, of non-cash share-based compensation expense, both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share would have increased by $0.14 per diluted share; EBITDA was $118.2 million, or 24.5 percent of revenue, compared to $81.7 million, or 19.8 percent of revenue, in the first quarter 2021 and $139.0 million, or 28.9 percent of revenue, in the fourth quarter 2021; and Achieved cash flow from operations of $72.3 million and $33.8 million of free cash flow, including $38.5 of capital expenditures.

We once again set new records across key financial metrics, including the 6th consecutive quarter of record revenue and gross profit, record gross margin that exceeded 40% for the first time in the Company\u2019s history, and the 5th consecutive quarter of record non-GAAP earnings per share.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Our strong revenue and margin performance continues to be driven by records achieved in the automotive end market, which reached 13% of revenue, the industrial market, as well as for our Pericom products. Gross margin expanded 720 basis points year-over-year due to a greater mix of higher margin products along with expanded factory utilization and loading. Another key factor to our ongoing success has been our content expansion initiatives and our total solution sales approach, resulting in expanded customer relationships and increasing design win momentum. And when combined with our diligent expense management, we delivered an almost 90% increase in adjusted earnings per share over the prior year period.\n\n\"Looking forward, we are well positioned with a global manufacturing footprint, including the proposed addition of the onsemi South Portland, Maine facility, which will greatly increase our internal capacity to support our future growth, especially in the automotive and industrial end markets. Demand for our products remains at high levels across all target end markets and geographies, and we are guiding for our 9th consecutive quarter of revenue growth and our 7th consecutive quarter of record revenue in the second quarter and also anticipating another solid year of strong growth and profitability for Diodes.\"\n\nFirst Quarter 2022\n\nRevenue for first quarter 2022 was a record $482.1 million, increasing 16.7 percent from $413.1 million in the first quarter 2021 and 0.4 percent from $480.2 million in the fourth quarter 2021.\n\nGAAP gross profit for the first quarter 2022 was a record $196.7 million, or a record 40.8 percent of revenue, increasing from $138.6 million, or 33.6 percent of revenue, in the first quarter of 2021 and $190.7 million, or 39.7 percent of revenue, in the fourth quarter 2021.\n\nGAAP operating expenses for first quarter 2022 were $103.6 million, or 21.5 percent of revenue, and on a non-GAAP basis were $99.5 million, or 20.6 percent of revenue, which excludes $3.9 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangible asset expenses and $0.3 million of acquisition-related costs. GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter 2021 were $91.2 million, or 22.1 percent of revenue, and in the fourth quarter 2021 were $104.7 million, or 21.8 percent of revenue.\n\nFirst quarter 2022 GAAP net income was a record $72.7 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income in the first quarter 2021 of $39.5 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, and GAAP net income of $65.5 million, or $1.43 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2021.\n\nFirst quarter 2022 non-GAAP adjusted net income was a record $80.3 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, which excluded, net of tax, $4.2 million non-cash mark-to-market adjustment of investments, $3.2 million of acquisition-related intangible asset costs and $0.2 million of acquisition-related costs.

As such, these results are subject to revision until the Company files its Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2022.\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nDr. Lu concluded, \"Backlog and demand remain very strong going into the second quarter, but due to the COVID-related lockdowns in China, especially in the Shanghai area, capacity was impacted at our local facilities during the first month of the quarter until now. With our excellent execution and recent improvements, we are guiding for sequential growth and expect revenue to be approximately $500 million, plus or minus 3 percent, and GAAP gross margin to be 41.0 percent, plus or minus 1 percent. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which are GAAP operating expenses adjusted for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, are expected to be approximately 21.0 percent of revenue, plus or minus 1 percent.

Excluding share-based compensation expense, both GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share would have improved by $0.11 per share.\n\nADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial statements present net income and earnings per share that are calculated using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). The Company\u2019s management makes adjustments to the GAAP measures that it feels are necessary to allow investors and other readers of the Company\u2019s financial releases to view the Company\u2019s operating results as viewed by the Company\u2019s management, board of directors and research analysts in the semiconductor industry. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with, and should not be considered alternatives or necessarily superior to, GAAP financial data and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies\u2019 non-GAAP financial measures, even if they have similar names. The explanation of the adjustments made in the table above, are set forth below:\n\nDetail of non-GAAP adjustments\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets \u2013 The Company excluded this item, including amortization of developed technologies and customer relationships. The fair value of the acquisition-related intangible assets is amortized using straight-line methods which approximate the proportion of future cash flows estimated to be generated each period over the estimated useful life of the applicable assets. The Company believes that exclusion of this item is appropriate because a significant portion of the purchase price for its acquisitions was allocated to the intangible assets that have short lives and exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both the Company\u2019s newly acquired and long-held businesses. In addition, the Company excluded this item because there is significant variability and unpredictability among companies with respect to this expense.\n\nAcquisition related costs \u2013 The Company excluded expenses associated with the acquisition of LITE-ON Semiconductor, which consisted of advisory, legal and other professional and consulting fees. These costs were expensed as they were incurred and as services were received, and in which the corresponding tax adjustments were made for the non-deductible portions of these expenses. The Company believes the exclusion of the acquisition related costs provides investors with a more accurate reflection of costs likely to be incurred in the absence of an unusual event such as an acquisition and facilitates comparisons with the results of other periods that may not reflect such costs.\n\nNon-cash mark-to-market investment adjustments \u2013 The Company excluded market to market adjustments on various equity related investments, including certain LSC equity investments. The Company believes this is not reflective of the ongoing operations and exclusion of this provides investors an enhanced view of the Company\u2019s operating results.\n\nRestructuring costs \u2013 The Company has recorded restructuring charges related to the shutdown and relocation of one of our assembly and test facilities located in Chengdu, China, restructuring at other China sites, and restructuring of select European entities. These restructuring charges are excluded from management\u2019s assessment of the Company\u2019s operating performance. The Company believes the exclusion of the restructuring charges provides investors an enhanced view of the cost structure of the Company\u2019s operations and facilitates comparisons with the results of other periods that may not reflect such charges or may reflect different levels of such charges.\n\nCASH FLOW ITEMS\n\nFree cash flow (FCF) (Non-GAAP)\n\nFCF for the first quarter of 2022 is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash flow from operations. For the first quarter of 2022, FCF was $33.8 million, which represents the cash and cash equivalents that we are able to generate after taking into account cash outlays required to maintain or expand property, plant and equipment. FCF is important because it allows us to pursue opportunities to develop new products, make acquisitions and reduce debt.\n\nCONSOLIDATED RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO EBITDA\n\nEBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization. Management believes EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties, such as financial institutions in extending credit, in evaluating companies in our industry and provides further clarity on our profitability. In addition, management uses EBITDA, along with other GAAP and non-GAAP measures, in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry. The calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing, operating in different income tax jurisdictions, and accounting effects of capital spending, including the impact of our asset base, which can differ depending on the book value of assets and the accounting methods used to compute depreciation and amortization expense. EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income from operations and net income, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. For example, our EBITDA takes into account all net interest expense, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization without taking into account any amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest. Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management\u2019s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA (in thousands, unaudited):\n\nThree Months Ended March 31 2022 2021 Net income (per-GAAP) $ 72,691 $ 39,452 Plus: Interest expense, net 288 2,096 Income tax provision 16,646 9,434 Depreciation and amortization 28,594 30,675 EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 118,219 $ 81,657\n\nDIODES INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED BALANCE SHEETS (in thousands) March 31, December 31, 2022 2021 (unaudited) (audited) Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 303,295 $ 363,599 Restricted Cash 2,710 3,219 Short-term investments 9,241 6,542 Accounts receivable, net of allowances of $5,394 and $4,324 at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively 362,035 358,496 Inventories 370,045 348,622 Prepaid expenses and other 104,763 107,194 Total current assets 1,152,089 1,187,672 Property, plant and equipment, net 589,915 582,079 Deferred income tax 21,755 21,256 Goodwill 147,968 149,890 Intangible assets, net 90,451 94,550 Other long-term assets 163,284 159,048 Total assets $ 2,165,462 $ 2,194,495 Liabilities Current liabilities: Line of credit $ 28,031 $ 18,068 Accounts payable 211,365 221,254 Accrued liabilities 167,392 184,649 Income tax payable 45,603 29,682 Current portion of long-term debt 11,102 17,381 Total current liabilities 463,493 471,034 Long-term debt, net of current portion 192,538 265,574 Deferred tax liabilities 32,432 32,230 Other long-term liabilities 116,980 122,933 Total liabilities 805,443 891,771 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders' equity Preferred stock - par value $1.00 per share; 1,000,000 shares authorized; no shares issued or outstanding - - Common stock - par value $0.66 2\/3 per share; 70,000,000 shares authorized; 45,231,793 and 45,017,774, issued and outstanding at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively 36,338 36,195 Additional paid-in capital 470,363 471,649 Retained earnings 1,189,500 1,116,809 Treasury stock, at cost, 9,272,513 shares held at March 31, 2022 and 9,272,513 shares held at December 31, 2021 (336,894 ) (336,894 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (61,804 ) (50,517 ) Total stockholders' equity 1,297,503 1,237,242 Noncontrolling interest 62,516 65,482 Total equity 1,360,019 1,302,724 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 2,165,462 $ 2,194,495\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20220504005968\/en\/\n\nContacts\n\nCompany Contact: \r\nDiodes Incorporated\r\nGurmeet Dhaliwal\r\nDirector, IR & Corporate Marketing\r\nP: 408-232-9003\r\nE: Gurmeet_Dhaliwal@diodes.com\n\nInvestor Relations Contact: \r\nShelton Group\r\nLeanne Sievers\r\nPresident, Investor Relations\r\nP: 949-224-3874\r\nE: lsievers@sheltongroup.com","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/diodes-incorporated-reports-record-first-200500901.html","symbols":["DDQ.F","DIOD.US","SQM.US"],"tags":["DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE","DILUTED SHARE","DIODES INCORPORATED","EARNINGS PER SHARE","FOURTH QUARTER","GAAP","NET INCOME","THE COMPANY"],"sentiment":{"polarity":1,"neg":0.048,"neu":0.838,"pos":0.115}},{"date":"2022-05-03T16:38:04+00:00","title":"Gerdau (GGB) to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?","content":"Gerdau S.A. GGB is slated to release first-quarter 2022 results on May 5.\r\n\r\nThe company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 14%, on average. It posted a negative earnings surprise of 9.8% in the last reported quarter. The company\u2019s first-quarter results are likely to reflect healthy demand from construction and industrial sectors and higher steel prices.\r\n\r\nShares of Gerdau have declined 9.9% in the past year compared with 3.7% rise of the industry. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nSome Factors at Play\n\nGerdau is likely to have benefited, in the first quarter, from strong demand for steel in its key operations. A recovery in major consumer sectors across its operations is likely to have supported its steel shipments in the March quarter.\r\n\r\nThe strong performance of the construction industry in Brazil and the United States along with higher global steel prices are also likely to have driven the company\u2019s margins in the quarter to be reported. It is likely to have witnessed higher production and shipments in its Brazil and North America business divisions on higher demand from the construction and industrial sectors. A rebound in light vehicle production in Brazil and the United States, healthy performance of the heavy vehicle sector in Brazil and the demand recovery in the oil and gas industry are also expected to have supported volumes in its Special Steel division in the first quarter. However, higher costs of key raw materials are likely to have weighed on its performance.\n\nGerdau S.A. Price and EPS Surprise Gerdau S.A.

Check Out These 2 Basic Materials Names","content":"Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. SQM (SQM) earns a Zacks Rank #1 15 days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 18, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.60 a share.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $1.60 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.23 Zacks Consensus Estimate, SQM has an Earnings ESP of 29.73%.\n\nSQM is part of a big group of Basic Materials stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Mosaic (MOS) as well.\n\nSlated to report earnings on August 1, 2022, Mosaic holds a #1 (Strong Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $4.59 a share 90 days from its next quarterly update.\n\nFor Mosaic, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.58 is 28.22%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSQM and MOS' positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.
