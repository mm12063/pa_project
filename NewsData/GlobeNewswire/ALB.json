(NYSE: ALB), reporting fourth quarter results on February 20th, with a headline of \u2018ALBEMARLE ENDS 2018 STRONG; PROJECTING CONTINUED GROWTH IN 2019\u2019.\n\nFourth quarter net sales were $921.7 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year; earnings were $129.6 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, an increase of 162% over the prior year. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $264.3 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year; adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.53, an increase of 14% over the prior year.\n\nThe long term investment potential of lithium is not being missed by Standard Lithium Ltd. (TSXV: SLL.V) (OTCQX:STLHF), a specialty chemical company focused on unlocking the value of existing large-scale US based lithium-brine resources, who recently announced it has entered into a funding equity agreement with a syndicate of underwriters led by Canaccord Genuity Corp., for gross proceeds of $10,500,000 (CAD).\n\nThe net proceeds from the Offering are expected to be used by the Company for advancing its existing asset portfolio and for general working capital purposes. The Company's flagship project is located in southern Arkansas, where it is engaged in the testing and proving of the commercial viability of lithium extraction from over 150,000 acres of permitted brine operations utilizing the Company's proprietary selective extraction technology based on AI (artificial intelligence) technology.\n\nLooking at the outlook for the sector, Zacks Research reported following Albemarle\u2019s fourth quarter numbers, with the headline \u2018Lithium ETF at One-Month High: Here's Why\u2019, \u201cSuch upbeat guidance and facts boosted investors\u2019 confidence about lithium demand. Albemarle\u2019s results acted as a cornerstone for the industry. Shares of other key lithium producers also gained on Feb 22.\u201d\n\nAlbemarle is part of the top 10 holdings of the Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF, a fund that invests in the full lithium cycle, from mining and refining the metal, through battery production. Other companies in their top ten include FMC Corp., LG Chem Ltd., Byd Co., Samsung, GS Yuasa Corp., Enersys, Panasonic and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nLooking at supply and demand, Tesla says, \u201cTo ramp production to 500,000 cars per year, Tesla alone will require today\u2019s entire worldwide supply of lithium-ion batteries.\u201d\n\nSo, Tesla bet big money and in 2014 began construction on the Tesla Gigafactory to supply enough batteries to support Tesla\u2019s projected vehicle demand.\n\nBYD Company Limited, the Chinese leader in the EV game is following suit, albeit a few years later, and just announced it has broken ground on a new 20 GWh battery gigafactory for electric cars, investing $1.49 billion USD in the facility.\n\nThe lithium market has not been without its setbacks though, as Nemaska Lithium Inc. (TSX: NMX.TO) (OTC: NMKEF) recently announced that it has terminated its multi-year supply agreement with Livent Corporation. The Supply Agreement pertains to the provision of up to 8,000 tonnes per year (28,000 tonnes in total during the term of the contract) of lithium carbonate starting April 1, 2019.\n\nWhile some see this a major issue, one news article stated that, \u201cGrowing evidence points toward a supply-side which will continue to struggle to deliver as Nemaska Lithium Inc. move to terminate a multi-year agreement to provide lithium carbonate to Livent Corp. The deal with Livent, spun out of major US lithium producer FMC Corp., saw Nemaska provide up to 8,000 tpa of lithium carbonate starting in April 2019. However these examples only serve to highlight supply instabilities across an infant industry.\u201d\n\nLooking at the recent volatility in the sector, while seeing a bullish future, Metalbulletin.com reported, \u201cWhile the supply side is weighing on sentiment, the demand side of the equation remains extremely bullish - and increasingly so.\u201d\n\nDemand for lithium is without question on the rise in the near and far reaching future, and while the industry has suffered minor blips and supply instabilities, smart money is betting on a bullish future for lithium and the stocks in the sector, with a leader Albemarle and juniors like Standard Lithium doubling down on what is looking like a sure thing.\n\nAbout Investorideas.com \r\nhttps:\/\/www.investorideas.com\/About\/\n\nFollow us on Social Media \r\nFollow us on Twitter https:\/\/twitter.com\/Investorideas\r\nFollow us on Facebook https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Investorideas\r\nFollow us on YouTube https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/Investorideas\n\nDisclaimer\/Disclosure: Investorideas.com is a digital publisher of third party sourced news, articles and equity research as well as creates original content, including video, interviews and articles.

Lithium-ion batteries will continue to dominate according to the report. \u201cIn a series of waves, the storage demand is powering upwards to over $200 billion in 2029 with buses and delivery vans already well into electrification.\u201d\n\nWhen discussing EV\u2019s and lithium demand, one company \u201cdriving\u201d the conversation is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Tesla has been on an upward push the last two years; for the three months ended September 30th, 2018 vs September 30th, 2017 Tesla reported revenue of $6.8MM vs $2.9MM, up 128.65%, with the estimated EPS forecast for the next fiscal year being $6.13 and is expected to report on January 29th, 2020.\n\nThe success of Tesla has allowed lithium extractors and producers to ride the same wave of success, but will there be enough lithium fast enough to meet market demands, and if so which company will take the lead?\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported very positive results just last week for Q4 and the 2018 financial year. Fourth quarter net sales were $921.7 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year; earnings were $129.6 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, an increase of 162% over the prior year.\n\n\"2018 was a successful year for Albemarle on many fronts. Excluding divested businesses, we delivered full year, total company adjusted EBITDA growth of 17%, adjusted diluted EPS growth of 23% and we finished the year strong as all of our reportable segments delivered growth in the fourth quarter. In addition, we returned significant value to shareholders through increased dividends of $145 million and $500 million in share repurchases, while continuing significant growth investment in our Lithium platform,\" said Luke Kissam, Albemarle's CEO. \"Lithium contributed just over 50% of our adjusted EBITDA, driven by 10% volume growth and 9% pricing compared to 2017.\"\n\nLess than 1.5 miles from Albemarle\u2019s Silver Peak Project, Enertopia Corporation (OTCQB: ENRT) (CSE: TOP) recently announced an update on their synthetic solution testing.\n\nSince Fall 2018, Enertopia has been running tests to recover lithium in the most cost-effective manner from synthetic brine solutions produced by leaching surface, lithium bearing claystones.\u00a0 To date, 32 solution tests have been run to create a database that forms the building block for upcoming solution tests.\n\nTheir 3rd phase of solution testing is expected to be in full swing by early March 2019 and will use drill core material from the diamond drill holes from their recently completed drilling program and will consist of 49 different sample intervals covering 397 feet of core.\n\nPre-pH adjustments have demonstrated positive outcomes as contaminant minerals are greatly reduced allowing for a cleaner synthetic lithium brine to be processed using off the shelf technologies and variants developed by Entertopia.\n\nThe company's technical advisors believe the positive testing to date may warrant patent protection and thus the Company is keeping all internal data strictly confidential at this time. The Company has signed several NDA\u2019s with industry partners as it works to reaching its goal of a low capex solution to battery grade lithium production.\n\n\u201cWith our positive drill program completed, our focus and energy can turn to our solution testing of the drilled lithium horizons. We continue to strive for a low-cost mining and processing solution to unlock the potential value of the Lithium enriched claystones,\u201d stated CEO, Robert McAllister.\n\nBig and small investors are taking note of the traction the lithium market is gaining, including Warren Buffet and Berkshire \u00a0Hathaway who recently disclosed a 0.7% stake on February 14th into Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE: SU) . And why?\u00a0 It fits into his EV strategy; one he started years ago with BYD, that has grown to become China\u2019s biggest sellers of EV\u2019s.\n\nSuncor just announced that Petro-Canada, a Suncor business, is building a network of electric vehicle (EV) fast charging stations across the country. \u201cWith more than 1,800 retail and wholesale locations across the country we have the network in place to build Canada\u2019s first electric highway, providing coast-to-coast EV charging for our customers. We\u2019re also investing in the fastest charging EV technology available today, which will be able to easily upgrade as technology advances.\u201d\n\nWith more positive financial results and improved extraction technology like Enertopia is working on, EV\u2019s and lithium are finally on point to replace the energy technology of the past; oil and gas.\n\nInvestor Ideas directory of lithium stocks: \u00a0mining stocks directory and cleantech stock directories, relating to batteries.\n\nAbout Investorideas.com \r\nhttps:\/\/www.investorideas.com\/About\/\n\nSocial Media \r\nTwitter https:\/\/twitter.com\/Investorideas\r\nFacebook https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Investorideas\r\nYouTube https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/Investorideas\n\nDisclaimer\/Disclosure: Investorideas.com: Our site does not make recommendations for purchases or sale of stocks, services or products.

(Nasdaq:MXWL), a developer and manufacturer of energy solutions announced it has entered into an agreement to be acquired at $4.75 per share by electric car company, Tesla, Inc. (Nasdaq:TSLA). The stock traded over 18 Million shares and was up over 49% for the day.\n\n\"We are very excited with today's announcement that Tesla has agreed to acquire Maxwell. Tesla is a well-respected and world-class innovator that shares a common goal of building a more sustainable future,\" said Dr. Franz Fink, President and Chief Executive Officer of Maxwell. \"We believe this transaction is in the best interests of Maxwell stockholders and offers investors the opportunity to participate in Tesla's mission of accelerating the advent of sustainable transport and energy.\"\n\nParamount to the future of the evolution of the auto industry is lithium. According to a report from Edinburgh Partners, \u201cdemand is expected to increase by a factor of 3-4 times by 2025 with the vast majority of the growth driven by pure Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV).\u201d\n\nStandard Lithium (TSXV:SLL) (OTCQB:STLHF) is well positioned as a strategic US source of battery quality lithium materials and is currently focused on the immediate development of its flagship, 180,000 acre Smackover Lithium project located in southern Arkansas.\n\nStandard Lithium just reported a combined Arkansas lithium brine resource of 3,888,000 tonnes LCE. Robert Mintak, CEO said, \u201cThis combined project in Southern Arkansas positions us as the largest lithium brine resource in the US; a significantly expanding market that currently relies on imports of foreign lithium.\u201d\n\nThe Company announced January 9th that it produced its first quantity of battery quality (>99.56% purity) lithium carbonate due to its AI-powered continuous crystallization technology.\u00a0 Its breakthrough rapid lithium extraction process reduces the recovery time of extracting lithium from brine from the current industry method that takes years, to as little as a few hours.\n\nStandard Lithium\u2019s recovery time may give them an edge on even some of the leaders, like Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB), based in Charlotte, NC. Albemarle says in its presentation, \u201cObtaining capabilities to bring lithium from mine to market takes time.\u201d\n\nHow important is lithium to the US economy?\u00a0 Just recently, Energy Secretary Rick Perry launched a recycling initiative to recover the critical elements in lithium-ion batteries, calling it \"a matter of national security.\"\n\n\"We aim to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of this material by encouraging entrepreneurs to capture up to 90% of America's lithium-based battery technology,\" Perry said.\n\nThey also note, \u201dThe lithium industry is still maturing from a technical and commercial perspective and does not behave like a commodity industry.\u201d\n\nExamples of advanced lithium materials from Albemarle include: patented lithium-based materials to enable long cycle life; Li2S \u2013 a key ingredient in next frontier solid separators; and lithium metal foils for next frontier anodes.\n\nAlbemarle says it is their goal to provide material to this industry to support and increase the success of lithium-ion technology, not only in mobile communication and power tool (PWT) applications, but also in electric mobility.\n\nLooking to the future, Albemarle also states, \u201cthe next generation of lithium batteries is on the horizon already.\u201d\n\nAnd the next generation of investors is betting on this sustainable technology. According to TD Ameritrade, looking at trading purchases over the last few months, Millennials bought Tesla (Nasdaq:TSLA), while the total population did not.\n\nSo the race is on; Simon Moores of Benchmark Minerals tweeted, \u201cWe are in the midst of a global battery arms race in which the US is a bystander. Since my last testimony only 14 months ago we have gone from 17 to 70 lithium ion battery megafactories in the pipeline.\u201d\n\nCompanies like Standard Lithium (TSXV: SLL) (OTCQB: STLHF) are ready for the challenge to meet the demands of the future and keep the US in the race.\n\nFor investors covering the sector, Investor Ideas has created a directory of cleantech and renewable energy stocks including a lithium stock directory.\n\nAbout Investorideas.com \r\nhttps:\/\/www.investorideas.com\/About\/\n\nSocial Media \r\nFollow us on Twitter https:\/\/twitter.com\/Investorideas\r\nFollow us on Facebook https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Investorideas\r\nFollow us on YouTube https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/Investorideas\n\nDisclaimer\/Disclosure: Investorideas.com: Our site does not make recommendations for purchases or sale of stocks, services or products.

Corfo, which leases mining rights in the Salar, had previously threatened to cancel its contract with Albemarle over the dispute, raising the spectre of potential supply disruptions amid booming demand.\n\nThe contract amendment that requires Albemarle to provide the ultralight battery metal at a reduced price is meant to spur a value-added lithium industry in Chile.\n\nAlbemarle produces most of its lithium from evaporation ponds. In November of 2018, the company\u2019s claim to developing a unique process to more than triple its lithium production from Chile\u2019s Atacama desert without using more water drew heavy scrutiny. Inside the US, Albemarle has already hinted at the potential of producing lithium to business owners operating near their Magnolia Arkansas operations, which is located nearby to Standard Lithium\u2019s potential commercial lithium project.\n\nConflicting reports regarding Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s recent alleged interest in new US-based lithium extraction technologies has shone a spotlight on a rising need for innovation. Beyond Buffett\u2019s group, there has already been a push from the lithium sector to innovate. Despite lingering doubts about the feasibility of the Berkshire Hathaway project to produce lithium from California geothermal wells, other projects are priming for lithium production from US brines.\n\nUnderstanding the need to innovate is Standard Lithium (TSX.V:SLL) (OTC:STLHF).Based in Southern Arkansas, with a planned joint venture involving a multi-billion-dollar global specialty chemical company, they are using innovative proprietary AI-powered rapid extraction technologies. This new high-tech approach may improve chances for success in this sector.\n\nAs international interests such as Germany and China jostle for position in other places like South America, securing North American lithium deposits is highly sought after domestically. The economic impact could be massive, as Chilean exports alone rose to $949 million in 2018.\n\nThrough its German partners, global chemical giant LANXESS and Standard Lithium have secured access to billions of gallons of lithium-rich brine; produced annually as a by-product of one of the world\u2019s largest bromine producers every year at their flagship project in Southern Arkansas.\n\nStandard Lithium Ltd. (TSX.V:SLL) (OTC:STLHF) has the infrastructure and investment potential in place to move forward on a massive operating commercial brine-fueled lithium project in the USA. Should the next stages of the pilot and commercial feasibility testing be a success, LANXESS has announced a financial commitment to push the project into production.\n\nLivent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM), focused on South America as well as Australia, calls itself \u201ca world leader in lithium technology.\u201d The company also holds 50 product patents.\n\nThey also state, \u201cOur control over the entire lithium operations chain-from pumping brine out of the ground to processing it into a range of performance products-enables us to lead the industry in lithium technology.\u201d\n\nWhen discussing the lithium market in an interview, CEO Paul Graves said, \u201cWe think demand is going to grow almost five times larger in 2025 than it was in 2017. Our biggest challenge is producing enough to meet the demand - there\u2019s a much greater risk that this market is consistently in a deficit in the near future.\u201d\n\nOther companies like Nemaska Lithium Inc. (TSX:NMX) (OTC:NMKEF), forecasted to be North America\u2019s next big lithium producer, is in the construction stage on its Whabouchi mine in the James Bay region of Quebec, Canada. According to the company\u2019s feasibility study, the capex on the project is set at approximately $875 million, of which Nemaska has already spent $272.4 million.\n\nNemaska Lithium has developed proprietary processes that use electrolysis to produce high-purity lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate for the lithium battery market. The technology virtually eliminates costly soda ash from the process.\n\nThe race to innovate in the lithium sector is on. According to Transparency Market Research,\u00a0 \u201cKey players are focused on the innovation of new technologies in order to gain market share and serve a diverse range of end-user industries.\u201d\n\nAbout Investorideas.com \r\nhttps:\/\/www.investorideas.com\/About\/\n\nSocial Media \r\nFollow us on Twitter https:\/\/twitter.com\/Investorideas\r\nFollow us on Facebook https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Investorideas\r\nFollow us on YouTube https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/Investorideas\n\nDisclaimer\/Disclosure: Investorideas.com: Our site does not make recommendations for purchases or sale of stocks, services or products.

(TSX Venture: CRU) (OTC: CRUUF) (FWB: SY7N) (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cCameo Cobalt\u201d) is pleased to announce that further to its news release dated October 4, 2018, the Company has completed site visits (the \u201csite visits\") to its Carrizal and Montreal Cobalt projects. Site visits attendees included Cameo Cobalt\u2019s Chilean geological team, Ridgeline Exploration Services (\u201cRidgeline\u201d), as well as certain advisors and consultants of the Company.\n\nSuccessful completion of the site visits allows Cameo Cobalt to prioritize its Chilean cobalt assets, as well as expedite the planning of the upcoming exploration roadmap. In addition to the successful site visit, the Company secured meetings with key officials from the Chilean Ministry of Mines, as well as John Mitchell, President of Genlith Inc. (\u201cGenlith\u201d). Genlith is a Pennsylvania-based holding company focused on energy storage and critical battery materials. Cameo Cobalt regards Genlith as its regional peer within the Chilean battery metals exploration arena.\n\nDuring the site visits the Company concluded a comprehensive review of the Carrizal and Montreal projects; including preliminary geological investigations and rock sampling on both properties. Rock samples have been sent to MS Analytical Laboratories in Vancouver, BC, for assays. The Company expects to receive assay results in the coming weeks and will provide the market with an update in due course. High-resolution photos from the site visits will be available on the company web site in the coming weeks (https:\/\/cameocobalt.com\/). \r\n\r\n Cameo Cobalt is extremely encouraged following its initial site visits; bolstered by strong support from the Chilean Ministry of Mines pertaining to the development of the Company\u2019s flagship energy metals assets. The Company is currently collaborating with Ridgeline, as well as its Chilean geological team to formulate a detailed year-round exploration program focusing on its Carrizal and Montreal Cobalt projects.\n\nAkash Patel, CEO of Cameo Cobalt stated: \u201cThe Company continues to remain bullish on the macro outlook for battery metal exploration. Cameo Cobalt believes that recent trends remain intact and are reinforced as global cobalt supply continues to be constrained. The majority of the World\u2019s cobalt supply is produced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a jurisdiction where human rights issues continue to be a concern. The Company\u2019s ultimate objective is to develop a portfolio of projects located in safe, ethical jurisdictions which can help to meet demand from the nascent EV revolution.\u201d\n\nCarrizal Cobalt Project\n\nThe Company\u2019s Carrizal Cobalt Project is situated adjacent to Genlith Inc.'s Carrizal Alto Project (see Genlith's news release dated April 11th). Genlith Inc. is a Pennsylvania-based holding company focused on energy storage and critical battery materials.\n\nGenlith has reported that cobalt production occurred on its Carrizal Alto projects from 1844 through 1944, mostly for military applications ceasing at the end of the Second World War.\u00a0Genlith\u2019s Carrizal Alto development plans include expedited drilling and dimensioning programs on high-grade past producing mines with the objective of providing a clear path to full-scale production.\n\nThe Company\u2019s Carrizal Cobalt claims map can be found by following the below URL link:\n\nhttps:\/\/cameocobalt.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/CRU-Carrizal-Map.pdf\n\nGenlith Inc. also recently announced the appointment of John Mitchell as the company\u2019s new President. Mr. Mitchell will also assume the role of Chief Executive Officer of Chilean Cobalt Corp. (\u201cC3\u201d), a subsidiary of Genlith. Mr. Mitchell joins Genlith after serving as President of Lithium for Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB). Mr. Mitchell guided Albemarle\u2019s lithium division to a global market leading position (see Genlith\u2019s news release dated July 25th, 2018).\n\nAbout the Montreal Cobalt Project\n\nThe Vendor reports that the Montreal Cobalt Project consists of 16 mineral claims and comprises a total of 4,500 hectares. The Company\u2019s Montreal Cobalt Project is less than 2 kilometres away from the past producing Merceditas mine. The acquisition of the Montreal Cobalt Project has entrenched Cameo Cobalt in two of the three historic cobalt-producing regions of Chile.\n\nThe Montreal Cobalt Project claims map can be found by following the below URL link:\n\nhttps:\/\/cameocobalt.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/CRU-Montreal-Map-.pdf\n\nCAMEO COBALT CORP.\r\n\u201cAkash Patel\u201d\n\nFor more information contact:\r\n(778) 549-6714\n\nOr Email: lucasbirdsall@gmail.com\r\nwww.cameocobalt.com\n\nReader Advisory This news release contains certain \u201cforward-looking information\u201d within the meaning of applicable securities law.

(the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cWealth\u201d) - (TSXV:WML) (OTCQB:WMLLF) (SSE:WMLCL) (Frankfurt:EJZN) announces that it has executed a binding letter agreement (the \u201cLetter Agreement\u201d), whereby Wealth or a Chilean subsidiary of Wealth has been granted the option and right to acquire 49% of the issued and outstanding shares of San Antonio Sociedad Contractual Minera (\u201cSan Antonio\u201d) and a 24.5% beneficial interest in certain exploration and exploitation mining concessions that comprise the Salares 7 Lithium project (the \u201cProperty\u201d or the \u201cSeven Salars Project\u201d). \u00a0The Property is a lithium brine asset portfolio currently owned 50% by Talison Lithium Ltd. (\u201cTalison\u201d) and 50% by San Antonio and has a total area of 39,400 hectares located over seven salars in Region II, northern Chile.\n\n\u201cThe Seven Salars Project is one of the most important large-scale lithium brine projects in Chile.\u00a0 The Property includes the Salar de La Isla, believed by many to be Chile\u2019s second largest lithium deposit and where 68 shallow drill hole samples returned an average lithium grade of 863 mg\/l,\u201d stated Hendrik Van Alphen, CEO, Wealth Minerals, Canada.\n\nTalison acquired its 50% interest in the Seven Salars Project in 2010 and completed drill testing in 2011, but since then the project has not moved forward.\n\nMarcelo Awad, Executive Director, Wealth Chile, \u201cWealth will bring a new dynamic to the ownership structure and the Company will be working diligently with the owners, allowing the project to realize its real potential.\u00a0 As a Chilean mining executive, I am pleased to help Chile become the dominant global lithium producer in the new green economy and I believe Seven Salars is one of the most geologically advanced new lithium projects in the country.\u201d\n\nA figure\u00a0accompanying this announcement is available at:\u00a0http:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/185a1702-2070-49a1-9735-8aebaee5ae12.\n\nOverview of the Seven Salars Project\n\nSeveral work programs have been completed on the Property (Figure 2).\u00a0 A regional geochemistry study of salars in Regions I, II and III of northern Chile was undertaken by a combination of government and non-government agencies between 1995 and 1999. \u00a0The work covered, but was not limited to, the Seven Salars Project.\u00a0 Surface water sampling of springs and lagoons was completed and the results demonstrated widespread occurrences of anomalous lithium and potassium in surface lagoons and ponds, including a maximum value of 1,080 mg\/l Li at Salar de La Isla. \u00a0Anomalous values were also recorded from a number of springs feeding these salars, although results were generally below 50 mg\/l.\n\nA figure\u00a0accompanying this announcement is available at:\u00a0http:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/0b657813-d0a3-4cc6-9da1-a3d9421e6423.\n\nConfirmatory sampling was undertaken by Taigo Consultants Limited in 2009 as part of a review of the Salares 7 Project. \u00a0A total of 25 surface water samples were collected from lagoons along the boundaries of, or springs flowing into, five of the seven salars (comprising the Property). \u00a0Results in general confirmed the results of the earlier regional survey. \u00a0Taiga recommended the use of geophysical surveys to locate high salinity sub-surface brines, followed by a drilling and sampling program to define the lithium and potassium content of the brine deposits.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2011, Talison completed Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) geophysical surveys, surface brine sampling and exploration drilling on the Property and TEM geophysical surveys were completed over five salars of the seven salars.\u00a0 The TEM method can provide an indication of basin geometry, continuity of hydrogeological units, geological structures and the presence of brine versus fresh groundwater. \u00a0Results identified a number of zones of high salinity and it appears that recent sediments have overlapped onto the salars in places, with brine extends beyond the current salar shore lines. \u00a0The results of the TEM survey indicate that the depth of the salars may exceed 200 m.\n\nApproximately 200 surface brine samples were collected and analyzed in the Talison Greenbushes Laboratory following routine QA\/QC protocols. \u00a0During sample collection a range of physical measurements were made on the brine including temperature, conductivity and pH. \u00a0Analytical results from Salar de La Isla indicate a wide range of lithium concentrations with a maximum value of 1,080mg\/l.\n\nThirty-four (34) drill holes totaling 562m were completed with a sonic drill in 2011.\u00a0 Twenty-seven (27) holes were drilled in Salar de La Isla and 7 holes in Salar de Las Parinas. \u00a0The holes were continuously cored and 92 brine samples were collected. \u00a0Drill hole locations were sited around the margins of the two salars as shown in Figures 3.\n\nA figure\u00a0accompanying this announcement is available at:\u00a0http:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/0fb53850-da7e-4de7-be9f-b8058bf7ac43.\n\nThe maximum drill depth in Salar de La Isla was 43.5 m and the average depth was 16 m. Analyses of brine samples obtained during the drilling program indicate lithium concentrations range from 220 mg\/l to a maximum of 1,080mg\/l; the average lithium concentration of 68 samples was 863 mg\/l. \u00a0The average Mg\/Li ratio was 6.6.\u00a0 Potassium concentrations ranged from 1,960 mg\/l to a maximum of 9,830 mg\/l; the average potassium concentration was 7,979 mg\/l.\n\nThe maximum drill depth in Salar de Las Parinas was 33 m and the average depth was 22m. \u00a0Lithium concentrations ranged from 260 mg\/l to a maximum of 480 mg\/l, with an average of 331 mg\/l.\u00a0 The average Mg\/Li ratio was 11. \u00a0Potassium concentrations ranged from 4,440 mg\/l to a maximum of 8,210 mg\/l, with an average of 5,650 mg\/l.\n\nThe Property also includes a land package within the Maricunga Salar, adjacent to concessions in the salar currently under exploration by Lithium Power International and Bearing Resources. \u00a0Earlier in 2017, Chilean state mining company CODELCO announced the formation of a lithium production subsidiary with the goal to advance development of the Maricunga Salar.\n\nThe other salars in the Property have varying degrees of historical work completed, including surface samples, water samples and geophysical surveys. The most significant of these is three brine samples on Salar de Aquilar, which returned lithium concentrations between 257 mg\/l and 337 mg\/l, as well as potassium concentrations between 2,910 mg\/l and 3,990 mg\/l.\n\nCommercial Terms\n\nSubject to acceptance of the Letter Agreement and the option grant transaction contemplated thereby (the \u201cTransaction\u201d) by the TSX Venture Exchange (the \u201cTSXV\u201d) and the completion of satisfactory due diligence by Wealth on the Property and other customary conditions precedent on or before 120 days from the execution of the Letter Agreement, including a National Instrument 43-101 technical report on the Property, if required, the existing shareholders of San Antonio (the \u201cSelling Shareholders\u201d) will sell and transfer to Wealth, at the closing of the Transaction (the \u201cClosing\u201d), shares representing 49% of the issued and outstanding shares of San Antonio in consideration for the payment by Wealth of USD 11,760,000 in cash and the issuance of 4,104,545 common shares of Wealth (the \u201cWealth Shares\u201d) in accordance with the following schedule:\n\nat Closing, an initial payment of USD 3,920,000 and the issuance of 4,104,545 Wealth Shares; a further payment of USD 3,920,000 on or before the day which is 4 months after Closing; and a further payment of USD 3,920,000 on or before the day which is 8 months after Closing.\n\nWealth will provide security for the payments due 4 months and 8 months after Closing by granting to the Selling Shareholders a pledge over the San Antonio shares being purchased by Wealth.\u00a0 In addition, the Letter Agreement provides that the definitive purchase and sale agreement will contain a buy-back provision, whereby Wealth will grant to the Selling Shareholders the right to re-acquire the San Antonio Shares purchased by Wealth at a price equivalent to 65% of the purchase price paid therefor, in the event that any of the purchase price installments are not fully paid as scheduled and such lack of payment is not remedied within 20 business days of such breach.\n\nThe Wealth Shares issued in connection with the Transaction will be subject to an initial resale restriction of 4 months and one day following the date of issue thereof.\u00a0 In addition, the Wealth Shares will be subject to an additional lock-up period of 8 months from the date of issue.\u00a0 During this lock-up period, the Selling Shareholders may only sell up to the aggregate amount of 250,000 Wealth Shares in any calendar month, and Wealth will have the first right of refusal to purchase any Wealth Share proposed to be sold by the Selling Shareholders during this period.\n\nWealth Lithium Interests in Chile\n\nWith this transaction, Wealth now has option interests in 16 salars and the properties have an aggregate area of 110,604 hectares (Table 1).\u00a0 The Company is now positioned as one of the largest holders of lithium property interests in Chile.\n\nTable 1: Wealth Minerals\u2019 Lithium Brine Property Interests in Chile ProjectSalarOption InterestHectaresAtacama ProjectAtacama100%46,000Trinity ProjectPujsa100% 1,600Calientes

with Two New Holes; Completes 2nd Phase Drilling","content":"VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - April 3, 2017) -Advantage Lithium Corp. (the \"Company\" or \"Advantage Lithium\") (TSX VENTURE:AAL)(OTCQX:AVLIF) and its joint venture partner, Nevada Sunrise Gold Corp. (\"Nevada Sunrise\"), are pleased to announce that the final two holes of the 2016-2017 drilling campaign at their Clayton Northeast property (\"Clayton NE, or the \"Property\") in Clayton Valley, Nevada, have intersected lithium in brine of up to 238ppm (hole CNE-17-05).\n\nAll six boreholes from the 2016\/17 program intersected lithium-bearing brines in typical Clayton Valley aquifer systems. As a result of interpreted faulting and displacement, the sixth borehole, collared in the southwest end of the Property, passed through a major fault zone and was terminated at a relatively shallow depth.\n\nThe successful conclusion of the Phase 2 drilling follows positive results previously released from the three Phase 1 boreholes drilled in 2016 (see NRs dated November 1, 2016, December 5, 2016, and December 21, 2016) and from the first borehole of the Phase 2 program, hole CNE-17-04 (see NR dated March 1), which delivered the best results to date at Clayton NE, with Total Composite 426.72m of 243.44mg\/l Lithium in Brines.\n\nRoss McElroy, Technical Advisor for Advantage Lithium, commented: \"These results conclude what has been a highly successful program at Clayton NE. Drilling during phase one and two has given us a 5.54 km mineralized brine trend that runs parallel to Albemarle's adjacent Silver Peak project, including drill holes that averaged more than 243mg\/l over wide intervals and with associated excellent brine flow. We have drilled some of the deepest holes in the Clayton Valley region and encountered potentially untested aquifers. We are very pleased with the first systematic drilling program conducted at Clayton NE and look forward to advancing the project further.\"\n\n2017 Drilling Program Highlights\n\nAll three of the Phase 2 boreholes intersected brine-bearing strata containing lithium. Holes CNE-17-04 and CNE-17-05 intersected multiple aquifer formations. Hole CNE-17-06 intersected one narrow aquifer zone:\n\nTotal composite of 426.72ms of brine-producing strata in CNE-17-04 at an average grade of 243.44 mg\/l lithium, including 274.6 mg\/l lithium over 79.2m (530.35m to 609.6m). Total composite of 164.59m of brine-producing strata in CNE-17-05 at an average grade of 72.47 mg\/l lithium, including 101.45 mg\/l lithium over 91.44m (304.8m to 396.24m). Total composite of 6.1 m of brine-producing strata in CNE-17-06 at a grade of 214 mg\/l from a depth interval of 262.13m to 268.22m. Successful extension of mineralized brine trend to 5.54km. Drilling has established strike length of significant lithium-bearing brines over 4.53 kilometres (between holes CNE-16-01 in the southwest of the Property through CNE-17-04 in the northeast). Drilling at CNE-17-06 has extended the trend of anomalous brine over an additional 1.01 kilometres to the southwest (between holes CNE-16-01 and CNE-17-06) for a total lithium-mineralized trend of 5.54km. Nevada Sunrise and Advantage Lithium drilled deeper into potentially untested aquifers. Phase 1 and 2 boreholes targeted areas of deeper aquifers that may not have been commonly intersected by historical drilling in the Clayton Valley. Hole CNE-16-03, from the Phase 1 program, was one of the deepest boreholes drilled in the Clayton Valley and, based on results obtained, may have encountered a previously untested aquifer. Permits\/waivers obtained for future development of a lithium brine resource and wells. In November 2016, waivers were received from the Nevada Division of Water Resources for 5 of the 6 permitted holes, which allows for reaming a borehole to a larger diameter well, pump testing, and flow rate determination in order to provide the necessary technical information for development of an initial lithium brine resource at Clayton NE.\n\nAbout the 2017 Drilling Program\n\nThe Phase 2 drilling program was comprised of a total of 1,389.89m (4,560 feet) in three RC holes and used a similar approach to the Phase 1 program that hit wide intercepts of lithium-bearing brine with strong brine flow rates. All six holes drilled in the 2016-2017 Clayton NE program are adjacent to the Silver Peak lithium brine field operation, North America's only producing lithium mine, operated by Albemarle Corporation (\"Albemarle\") (NYSE: ALB), in close proximity to several of its production wells.\n\nThe second borehole drilled in the Phase 2 program, CNE-17-05, intersected multiple aquifer formations containing brine-producing strata, but with more subdued levels of lithium in brine, which included 164.59m averaging 72.47 milligrams per litre (\"mg\/l\") lithium between a depth of 256.03m and 420.62m metres, including a higher-grade interval averaging 101.45 mg\/l lithium over 91.44m from a depth of 304.8m to 396.24m. The borehole was completed to a depth of 420.62m, terminating in Paleozoic bedrock.\n\nThe third and final Phase 2 borehole, CNE-17-06, passed through the Angel Island Fault Zone and encountered bedrock at a relatively shallow depth of 327.66m, earlier than in previous holes. The hole was completed to a depth of 347.47m, terminating in Paleozoic bedrock. In general, this hole produced relatively low saline-water flow. The exception was the zone from 262.13m to 268.22m that contained strong brine with lithium concentration of 214 mg\/l.\n\nCNE-17-05 - Technical Details\n\nCNE-17-05 was completed to a depth of 420.62 metres (1,380 feet) into Paleozoic bedrock. The stratigraphy in the area of this hole has been affected by faulting and displacement and did not encounter the Main Ash marker unit. Lower lithium concentrations in brine were encountered in the hole than those encountered in other holes in the program. However, lithium concentrations in the zone from 304.8 to 396.24 metres averaged 101.45 mg\/l, over 91.44 metres (300 feet). The highest lithium concentration was 238 mg\/l in the zone from 304.8 to 310.89 metres. The entire sampled interval from 256.03 to 420.62 metres (164.59 metres) averaged 72.47 mg\/l lithium.\n\nCNE-17-06 - Technical Details\n\nCNE-17-06 was completed to a depth of 347.47 metres (1,140 feet). It is interpreted that the hole was collared on the northeast side of the Angel Island Fault and penetrated the Angel Island Fault Zone at a depth of 170.60 metres (560 feet). Sediment cuttings indicate that the drill was in the Lower Gravel Aquifer beneath the fault to depth of 327.66 metres (1,075 feet) where the drill penetrated Paleozoic bedrock. With the exception of the narrow interval from 262.13 to 268.22 metres, this hole produced only weak brines. This interval did, however, produce relatively strong brine with a concentration of 214 mg\/l lithium, high concentrations of other alkali metals, high specific gravity, and brine salinity.\n\nTable 1: Results of Lithium in Brine Samples for CNE-17-05 and CNE-17-06\n\nDrill Hole Aquifer SystemInterval (m) Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) mg\/l Lithium\r\n Range (mg\/l) Lithium\r\n Average Grade (mg\/l) From To Width CNE-17-05 Lower Gravel Aquifer256.03 420.62 164.59 34,000 to 82,200 79.1 to 238 72.47 including304.80 396.24 91.44 34,000 to 82,200 81.3 to 238 101.45CNE-17-06 Lower Gravel Aquifer262.13 268.22 6.1 26,600 NA 214.00\n\nIn addition to brine samples, throughout the 2016-2017 program drill cuttings were collected for each 1.5 metre interval and over 360 samples were submitted for analysis. Analytical results received for the drill cuttings for five holes of the 2016-2017 program indicate significant lithium values in sediments that range up to 1,440 parts per million (\"ppm\") lithium, as shown in Table 2 below.

Clayton NE is subject to an option earn-in agreement where Advantage Lithium can earn up to a 70% interest in the Project after fulfilling CDN$3.0 million in exploration expenditures on a package of five lithium properties optioned from Nevada Sunrise (for further details, see Nevada Sunrise news release dated June 20, 2016); Nevada Sunrise is the project manager at Clayton NE on behalf of Advantage Lithium, the operator.\n\nFor further information on Clayton NE, including location maps, see the Company's website www.advantagelithium.com.\n\nGroundwater samples were sent to Western Environmental Testing Laboratory in Reno, Nevada for analysis. General chemistry testing included analysis for specific gravity, total hardness and alkalinity, bicarbonate, carbonate, hydroxide, TDS and electrical conductivity. Anions (chloride, sulfate) were analyzed by ion chromatography. Trace metals (lithium, magnesium, boron, calcium, potassium and sodium) were analyzed by ICP-OES. TDS values obtained in the field are measured with a handheld YSI Model 556 Multiparameter Meter, which meets Good Laboratory Practice (as proscribed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) for calibration and measurement. All depth measurements reported, including sample and interval widths are down-hole. As holes are oriented vertical and geologic stratigraphy is primarily horizontal to sub-horizontal, downhole measurements are assumed to be close to true thickness.\n\nComposite sediment samples were submitted to ALS Minerals in Reno, NV, and analyzed at ALS Minerals in Vancouver, BC. by way of 48-element, four-acid ICP-MS.\n\nThe technical information in this news release has reviewed and approved on behalf of the company by Ross McElroy, P.Geol., Technical Advisor for Advantage Lithium Corp., and a \"Qualified Person\" as defined in NI 43-101.\n\nAbout Advantage Lithium Corp.\n\nAdvantage Lithium Corp. is a resource company specializing in the strategic acquisition, exploration and development of lithium properties and is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia.
