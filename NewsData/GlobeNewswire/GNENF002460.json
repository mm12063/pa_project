(\"Arena\" or the \"Company\") (TSX-V: AN) is pleased to announce it has completed drilling of its first diamond drill hole (DD-02) at the Sal de la Puna Project (\u201cSDLP Project\u201d) located in the Pastos Grandes basin within Salta province, Argentina. The diamond drill hole is located on the Almafuerte claim and intersected a continuous brine column from 140 metres to the total drilled depth of 646 metres. The entire sampled brine column averaged 496 milligrams per litre (\u201cmg\/l\u201d) lithium (\u201cLi\u201d).\n\nAn uninterrupted gravel aquifer was intersected between 334 metres and 634 metres down hole, representing the thickest gravel sequence drilled in the basin. The gravel aquifer averaged 503 mg\/l Li with grades as high as 557 mg\/l Li at 550 metres below surface. Gravel and sand aquifers typically have favourable effective porosity values and high flow rates, which translate to highly productive wells. DD-02 was completed as an observation well with 2-inch diameter blank and screened PVC casing to 450 m depth.\n\nWilliam Randall, President & CEO of Arena, stated, \u201cThis first drill hole completed by Arena exceeds our expectations. The coarse gravel aquifer, where higher flow rates are typically found, appears to be thicker in our end of the Pastos Grandes basin with high grade lithium values and favourable geochemistry. We kept the drill turning past our target depth to determine the total thickness of this gravel sequence; however, the brine column remains open at depth for future potential resource expansion.\u201d He added, \u201cWe have now mobilized an additional drill rig to ensure we meet our development timelines.\u201d\n\nDepth specific brine sampling was caried out in DD-2 over the entire brine column using double and simple packer sampling systems. The brine column averaged magnesium to lithium ratios of 4.5 to 1 and sulphate to lithium ratios of 15 to 1.\n\nEduardo Morales, Executive Chairman of Arena, added, \u201cIn addition to excellent lithium grades, we are very pleased with the brine geochemistry. The magnesium and sulphate ratios are within those currently used in our pilot facilities giving us great confidence that our objective of producing technical grade lithium chloride (6% Li) is achievable from the drilled aquifers.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nMobilization of two additional drills\n\nThe Company is also pleased to announce that two additional drill rigs have been mobilized to site. One diamond drill rig is currently set up at DD-01, located on the Graciela claim, and has a target depth of 550 metres. The depth of the hole may be extended if favourable lithologies are encountered, as happened in DD-02 in the adjacent Almafuerte claim.\n\nA second rotary drill is scheduled to mobilize in three weeks to Almafuerte to drill a production well (P-1) 15 metres away from DD-02. The well has a target depth of 450 metres and looks to test the productive capabilities of the gravel aquifer intersected in DD-02 by completing pumping tests using the neighbouring DD-02 as a monitoring well.\n\nArena is operating the drill program on behalf of Sal de la Puna Holdings Ltd., which is jointly owned by Arena (65%) and Ganfeng New Energy Technology Development (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. (\u201cGanfeng Lithium\u201d; 1772.HK; OTCQX: GNENF) (35%).\n\nThe drill program is focused on the Almafuerte and Graciela blocks which border Lithium America\u2019s (TSX: LAC; NYSE: LAC) Pastos Grandes project to the south and south-east and consists of 3,000 metres with the objective of both increasing the category of the current resource and increasing the SDLP Project\u2019s resource base.\n\nThe drill program is jointly designed and supervised by the Company and Atacama Water consultants. All brine samples are sent to SGS Laboratories, Salta, Argentina, an independent and fully international accredited laboratory for analysis for lithium multi-element Induction Coupled Plasma Spectroscopy.

Sal de la Puna Holdings owns 100% interest in the Sal de la Puna Project (\u201cSDLP\u201d) in the Pastos Grandes Basin located in Salta, Argentina, and is jointly owned by Arena (65%) and Ganfeng New Energy Technology Development (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. (\u201cGanfeng Lithium\u201d; 1772.HK; OTCQX: GNENF) (35%).\n\nThe approved work program focuses on expanding the recently announced maiden lithium brine resource estimate (please refer to press release dated October 19, 2021) and advancing processing studies in order to establish an optimal route for the production of high purity lithium products.\n\nHighlights of the approved work program include:\n\nDrilling to focus on resource upgrade and expansion Minimum 3,000 metres of diamond drilling 2 large diameter production wells Drilling covering 6 claims within Pastos Grandes basin Pilot plant and pond construction Engineering studies to optimize process routes to produce >30% lithium chloride products\n\nThe work program is fully permitted and is set to commence immediately.\n\n\u201cThis work program is the backbone of our plan to fast-track the Sal de la Puna Project to a production decision. The drill program will help determine the potential resource on the most prospective claims while establishing a high quality measured and indicated resource on the Almafuerte & Graciela claims. Along with our engineering and processing studies that form part of this program, Arena will be in a great position to compile a preliminary mine plan and corresponding economic study,\u201d commented Eduardo Morales, Executive Chairman.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThanks to the sizeable backing from our partner Ganfeng Lithium and strategic investor Lithium Americas (TSX: LAC; NYSE: LAC) we are fully funded for the approved work program at SDLP,\u201d added William Randall, President & CEO.\n\nResourceGrowthProgram\n\nThe drill program will be focused on the Almafuerte and Graciela blocks which border Millennial Lithium\u2019s Pastos Grandes project to the south and south-east. A map showing the proposed locations of the drill holes and wells can be seen in Figure 1. The program has been designed by the Management Committee, Arena and consultants to the Company with the objective of both increasing the category of the current resource and increasing the Project\u2019s resource base.\n\nTo date, resources have only been defined on the Almafuerte block covering approximately 6.5% of the total landholdings of the Company in the Pastos Grandes basin. Additional drill holes and a production well are planned within the Alamfuerte claim to increase the resource category and conduct long term pump tests to evaluate production potential of the lithium bearing aquifers. If successful, this drilling will allow the Company to graduate portions of the resource to Measured and\/or Indicated categories and conduct preliminary wellfield designs, including predicted production capacities.\n\nPriority resource expansion drilling will focus on the Graciela block, located less than one kilometre north of the Almafuerte block. Graciela lies immediately adjacent to established lithium bearing aquifers drilled by other operators in the basin. Favourable geophysics suggest these brine bodies continue onto the Graciela block.\n\nBrine is also interpreted to occur in the Patovica I, Barreal II and southern end of the La Relojera properties, as determined by proximity to known brine bodies and favourable geophysics. TEM lines across these properties indicate the presence of brines at depth, within a well-established lithium bearing basin. Exploration drilling is planned for these properties, more than doubling the drilled area.\n\nEngineeringandMetallurgical Program\n\nThe main objective of the approved metallurgical program is to optimize Arena\u2019s processing technology at SDLP. The process will aim to produce a low volume, concentrated >30% lithium chloride (approximately 6% Li) product that can be transported over great distances cost effectively to produce battery grade lithium carbonate. This process allows a centralized lithium carbonate plant to be constructed off-site at lower altitudes in areas with greater infrastructure and access to skilled labour.\n\nTesting has commenced at laboratory scale and shall proceed to greater and more continuous volumes at a pilot facility to be constructed at SDLP. The pilot facility is fully permitted and will consist of laboratory modules and lined evaporation ponds.\n\nThe results will be used to continuously optimize concentration paths culminating in an initial pond design and basic engineering, including inputs for operating cost estimates and capital requirements. These results, along with the resource expansion program, will form the basis of an economic study on SDLP.\n\nBudget\n\nA budget of approximately USD 4 million has been approved and will be contributed on an ownership pro-rata basis by Arena and Ganfeng Lithium. The SDLP work program will be operated by Arena as stipulated in the SDLP Joint Venture Agreement (for more details please refer to press release June 10, 2021).\n\nAboutArenaMineralsInc.\n\nArena owns 65% of the Sal de la Puna Project covering approximately 11,000 hectares of the Pastos Grandes basin located in Salta, Argentina.

To be sure, not much has changed: we\u2019re still in the midst of a pandemic and look to be for a good portion of 2021. However, one thing is shifting: the rumblings of EV pushback are clear. And battery stocks will be a benefactor of this pushback.\n\nIt is my belief that EV stocks are going to remain hot through 2021. However, markets and capital are going to move into EV suppliers with more force. That means battery manufacturers and suppliers to these companies should become more attractive this year.\n\n8 Biometric Stocks to Consider as We Eye a Return to Normal\n\nThis list is focused on exactly that: EV battery manufacturers and suppliers thereto. Any and all of these stocks are a buy in my eyes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) Ganfeng Lithium (OTCMKTS:GNENF) Panasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) Romeo Power (NYSE:RMO) Vale (NYSE:VALE) Glencore (OTCMKTS:GLNCY)\n\nBattery Stocks: Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM) a lithium mine\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInvestors who have interest in EVs are likely well aware of lithium as a mineral integral to the sector. Lithium-ion battery chemistry has become the leading battery type used in the industry. Therefore, lots of lithium is necessary until a better suited chemistry is commercialized. The leading candidates don\u2019t look to be commercialized for some time yet. The upshot is lithium mining is a smart place to be for EV investment.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile and its SQM stock lead off this list. The Chilean company is a major producer of lithium. Lithium currently accounts for about 16% of Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile\u2019s profit and the company is making a major investment in increasing its lithium capacity.\n\nIt is clear that the company sees lithium as important to its immediate future. The company has four scheduled expansions through 2023. It is investing $240 million toward lithium production expansion, which will increase production by 69.5% by the second half of 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat means the company will go from the ability to produce 83.5 million tons of lithium to 141.5 million tons by the end of this year. The company is not stopping there. It intends to invest a further $150 million to bring total lithium capacity to 210 million tons by 2023. That 151.5% capacity increase is indicative of larger demand.\n\nThe company did experience a revenue decrease of 11% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. However, lithium sales volumes increased 40% between Q2 and Q3 making this a worthwhile play moving forward.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov\/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle is another major name in lithium production. It also experienced a sales decline and is positioning itself to take advantage of opportunities in lithium. Despite the downturn, ALB stock is definitely a smart play that makes sense in the EV space.\n\nThe company explains its overarching strategy thusly: \u201cOur long-term strategy and capital allocation priorities remain the same: to invest in lithium growth using cash flows from our entire enterprise, while maintaining our dividend and investment grade credit rating.\u201d\n\nAlbemarle depends on lithium for 37% of its total revenue currently and anticipates 20% industry growth. Albemarle experienced a sales decline of 19.6% in its lithium segment and 15.1% across its entire business in Q3 of 2020. The company says that while lithium market growth was stunted in 2020 that it still anticipates the same overall future growth.\n\n8 Biometric Stocks to Consider as We Eye a Return to Normal\n\nMy thesis is that it makes sense to invest now while revenue is relatively weakened and Wall Street views ALB stock as a \u201chold.\u201d Revenue may have slipped, but earnings well outpaced guidance for the quarter, and the company remains solidly entrenched in its lithium strategy.\n\nBattery Stocks: Ganfeng Lithium (GNENF) rows of lithium ion batteries\n\nSource: Lightboxx\/ShutterStock.com\n\nChina is a massive market for EVs. In fact, it\u2019s the world\u2019s largest by market share. But the country also has massive natural resources, which gives it another advantage when it comes to EVs. It has national champions including Nio (NYSE:NIO) and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV), and it has companies like Ganfeng Lithium which can supply them.\n\nThe company is headquartered in China and has operations in Australia, Argentina, Ireland and Mexico. Ganfeng Lithium is clearly well-diversified geographically. But it is also diversified in terms of its operations. It maintains lithium operations upstream, mid-stream and downstream, meaning it does everything from mining lithium to lithium battery manufacturing.\n\nNot only is the company massive, but it has also experienced robust growth. Ganfeng\u2019s CAGR averaged 41% between 2015 and 2019. Profitability growth decreased in 2019 although still a very healthy 16%. But it has begun to rise again in 2020.\n\nPanasonic (PCRFY) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing\/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe previous three stocks were all lithium producers. It is time to move up the value chain into the actual battery manufacturers. Most readers will recognize that Panasonic does many things. It is not a dedicated EV battery manufacturer by any stretch of the imagination. However, it does produce batteries for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). That alone makes it a name worth mentioning in this space. The simple fact is that to a degree, as Tesla goes, so goes the whole EV market.\n\nAnyway, the important consideration here for investors is the EV business between Panasonic and Tesla. Tesla has long been speculated to want to bring battery production in-house. But the long-time relationship it has had with Panasonic will continue through at least 2022.\n\n8 Biometric Stocks to Consider as We Eye a Return to Normal\n\nPanasonic is under pressure to increase energy storage capacity by Tesla. By 2025 its Model 3 battery is slated to have improved energy storage capacity by 20%. It is also under pressure to make similar leaps for the Tesla Model S and Model X.\n\nBattery Stocks: Romeo Power (RMO) A man holding two puzzle pieces surrounded by more, smaller puzzle pieces. SPAC IPOs\n\nSource: Pasuwan\/ShutterStock.com\n\nNow is the time to invest in Romeo Power. Prices have recently come down and now RMO stock\u2019s price point makes sense in addition to its strategic positioning. For an excellent run down of why Romeo Power is a bargain on a purely quantitative, objective basis, check out this article by InvestorPlace\u2019s Mark Hake. Numbers don\u2019t lie, and these numbers indicate that there is lots of upside in RMO shares.\n\nFrom a more subjective perspective there\u2019s also lots to like about Romeo Power. Most readers will know that many SPAC-funded EV companies came to market in 2020. Romeo Power is also a SPAC. But it is an EV supplier, not a manufacturer. The company makes battery packs for two segments: class 4-8 trucks and buses and high-performance vehicles, along with other commercial vehicles. EV battery manufacturing should continue to have many tailwinds as the decarbonization push shows little indication of slowing. EVs are here to stay.\n\nThe company has $544 million in contracted revenue, and another $2.2 billion possible under negotiation. So the $350 million it received at closing should be utilized to fulfill the sales it has booked. The company has an excellent chance to be the name behind truck electrification efforts underway at companies like Peterbilt (NASDAQ:PCAR) and Freightliner (OTCMKTS:DDAIF).\n\nRomeo Power has established relationships with 68% of the class 8 vehicle manufacturers in North America currently. They simply have to take SPAC funds and prove that their technology will effectively work for those companies. If they can, revenue will flow. That\u2019s why this stock makes so much sense at current prices.\n\nVale (VALE) the Vale (VALE) logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's webpage in the background\n\nSource: rafapress \/ Shutterstock.com\n\nLet\u2019s switch gears again and go back to the far upstream of the battery industry. The first three stocks on this list were all related to lithium used in the manufacturing of the batteries themselves. There\u2019s another mineral also very important in the battery manufacturing process: nickel. Nickel is set to receive high demand due to its utility in the EV battery manufacturing process. And on the supply side, there simply isn\u2019t enough nickel to satisfy that demand. In fact, there may be a 10-fold increase in demand between 2018 and 2025.\n\n8 Biometric Stocks to Consider as We Eye a Return to Normal\n\nThe calculus is simple: produce and supply that nickel and make great profits. Vale increased its sales of nickel by 37.3% in Q3 of 2020. VALE stock is rated a \u201cbuy\u201d and shares are currently less than $20, making it an attractive play in EV batteries. It is probably the strongest play in battery stocks as it relates to nickel in production.\n\nBattery Stocks: Glencore (GLNCY) a group of connected batteries\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLast but not least on this list of battery stocks is Glencore. Like Vale, it is included because of its focus on nickel production. The company produces nickel in Asia, Australia, North America and Europe. In Q3 Glencore experienced a 9% decrease in nickel production as a result of operational restrictions due to Covid-19 at its Koniambo plant in New Caledonia. The company produced 81,800 tons of nickel in the period.\n\nPrices have remained basically steady in the past two years for nickel, according to the company, but Glencore will have plenty of opportunity to sell to EV battery manufacturers as long as it can produce the metal.\n\nGlencore is diversified across mineral and metals mining. It is also relatively cheap at less than $10 per share. The company is well funded and in position to serve EV battery manufacturers, as well as many other downstream companies across many industries. GLNCY stock is cheap with a lot of upside and worth a look.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nAlex Sirois is a freelance contributor to InvestorPlace whose personal stock investing style is focused on long-term, buy-and-hold, wealth-building stock picks.

Investors are giving the cold shoulder to mine developers seeking funding for lithium projects.\n\n\"This pandemic further kicks the EV can down the road,\" said Seth Goldstein, a lithium industry analyst with Morningstar.\n\nThe holdup will result in a shortage of the white metal available for EV batteries when markets rebound, warned industry analysts, executives and consultants.\n\n\"We don't want to spend a great deal on lithium at the moment,\" said Vincent Mascolo, chief executive of Ironridge Resources Ltd, which has put its Ghana lithium project up for sale. \"Investor appetite is not there.\"\n\nThis year began with expectations that global demand for the white metal would jump 15%, according to Morningstar. The advisory group now expects a 5% drop in demand in 2020.\n\nAlbemarle Corp has slowed expansion projects in Chile and Australia. Tianqi Lithium Corp, saddled by debt, is selling its controlling stake in the world's largest lithium mine. SQM said it may shelve lithium expansion plans for the year.\n\nAnalysts point to Ganfeng Lithium Co's move this year to take control of an Argentina lithium project from smaller, indebted miner Lithium Americas Corp as the type of opportunistic deals likely during the pandemic.\n\nLithium executives, investors and analysts expect the downturn to roil their industry for at least a year. Some warned it could crimp operations through the middle of the decade depending on how COVID-19 affects EV deployment plans from Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and other automakers.\n\nStory continues\n\nConventional wisdom holds that low oil prices should encourage consumers to buy internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Still, electric vehicle sales should ultimately rise as environmental concerns have prompted EV subsidies and regulations in China and the European Union.\n\n\"If you make EVs the only vehicles available on the lot, consumer buying patterns change very fast,\" said Devin Lindsay, an automotive analyst at IHS Markit Ltd.\n\nAnd because China and the EU are the world's biggest EV producers, their regulations are seen as ultimately forcing greater EV adoption in the United States, where fuel prices might usually influence car buying.\n\n\"For good or bad, this EV thematic is driven by regulations and government incentives, rather than economics,\" Paul Graves, chief executive of lithium producers Livent Corp, told Reuters.\n\nEVs are expected to become the most-popular vehicles, globally, though the pandemic makes the timing uncertain.\n\n\"The long-term story is a structural trend toward EV adoption. It's very well on its way,\" said Pedro Palandrani of the Global X Lithium & Battery Technology ETF.\n\n(Reporting by Helen Reid and Ernest Scheyder; Editing by David Gregorio)","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/lithium-producers-must-wait-pandemic-140537463.html?.tsrc=rss","symbols":["002460.SHE","002466.SHE","ALB.US","F.US","GNENF.US","LAC.US","VLKAF.US","VLKPF.US","VWAGY.US","VWAPY.US"],"tags":["ALBEMARLE CORP","EXPANSION PROJECTS","LITHIUM INDUSTRY","LITHIUM PRODUCERS"],"sentiment":{"polarity":0.777,"neg":0.054,"neu":0.889,"pos":0.057}}]
